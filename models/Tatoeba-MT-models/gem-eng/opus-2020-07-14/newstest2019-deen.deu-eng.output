DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Ozil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on one getting into conversation, that one also talks with him about why he has apparently felt something like that in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmaher" of the "picture newspaper.
Despite the now monthly debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at a certain point that this would be so," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB-Team in July, and also justified the fact that he had not defended him against racist animosities during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal Trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change an association you talk about it with his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation hasn't happened so far".
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m., the professional fire department Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly across the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was delayed.
The professional fire department stepped out and found it in full fire when the cabin arrived.
The roof had to be completely removed and fire sheltered to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owners of the burning garden cottage, he had a battery attached to the shop at noon.
That could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger was in the greatest fire intensity according to the fire brigade.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable because the owner had many collector's items in his garden cottage.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks the refugee family on the open road
What led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
Apparently, she wanted to pull the children away from a alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live as she seems to want to tear the children away from a family in Moscow.
This reports the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial integration of the stream.
Here you see "Kissing lucky" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan is getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She's accusing adults of trading children.
For all that, she doesn't give any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
Looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earlash.
Under tears, the actress then cares how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What has moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is intended to approach Ryugu asteroid so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to the earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams are not yet in the deserted areas, which have been cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board
At the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletro Automaker.
The U.S. stock exchange monitor sued him for fraud, but now both agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla's boss withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain as Chairman of the Board.
UK Conservative Party
Sharply guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
At the party's meeting, foreign policy, trade and development policy will be discussed, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on the leading front ex-Minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia will be called Northern Macedonia and the population will agree on this Sunday - whether it is good?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - is meant by Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential elections in Brazil, the mood is divided in the country.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and thus lies in the front of the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: This will take longer than planned.
"The Diesel Task Force is still in place," said development director Peter Mertens, the industry sheet "Automobilwoche".
The detained and retired Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we have reached an important stage in the process of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder had made "grass organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities propose to the Audi Chief to have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas fraud has become known.
He knew of the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, Bram Schot is head of the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the change to the new emission and consumption test standard WLTP gives it production losses at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronn voice".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Shot is relying on electromobility.
There were already 15 000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm is to be in the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President in spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Ozil affair next year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as I can," said Grindel as a guest at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on the early Sunday morning.
You have to try to re-election again and again, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association found it "wonderful" if he did not "listen to work on the future project" after the supplement for the football EM 2024.
Grindel has been head of the Federation since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who died over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be taken at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM organiser Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he would also be advised in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting questions," said Grindel.
He did not want to take part in any speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player should become a DFB without a migration background.
At present, this office of the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is a person who is clearly involved in society and football without a migration background and says, "the topic is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Decaying correctly with a half smart scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is rather for the sausage.
Doesn't matter if I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball League: Clear turnaround for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin was launched with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball League.
With 112:55 (52:31), the vice- champ won no problem against Science City Jena and offered a convincing game for over 40 minutes.
New entry Rokas Giedraitis was with 20 points top scorer of the dominant Berliner.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) obliged from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Ex-Meister Brose Bamberg won with 84:80 (39:37) by coach Ainars Bagatskis during the compulsory game debut with s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was among the guests with 24 points best throwers.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points hit with the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.
With the basketball lion Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings overcame the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, in which NBA-Star Dennis Schröder has been a majority shareholder since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver live followers of the Gülen movement in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathy from the PKK or guild movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand policemen were employed - among them also sharp-shooters.
The Islam Association Ditib stands in criticism because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Horror Second
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a concert at the New York Central Park for more commitment in the fight against poverty and diseases.
"Involve you wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival during the night to Sunday in front of some 60.0000 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations were also shown on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a horrific second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots was frightened and tried to escape.
In a short time, panic arose, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to meet had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause by the audience - Buhrufe for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for more equal rights for men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus came across many women.
At least three women have filed accusations of abuse until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects it.
Flake demanded an FBI investigation of the allegations after he confronted two women who reportedly experienced sexual assaults themselves on the way to committee meetings in an elevator.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," said Flake at the concert in New York about the audience.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's throwout
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the robbery of a journalist by the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office of chancellors, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance of the press conference's course.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he's made people's protectors bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This applies completely regardless of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or of support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah guild movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the journalists accused threaten decades of imprisonment.
Even foreign journalists are not sure about the Turkish authorities: Only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Last time, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey they still run trials against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yes, this is actually Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid conversation at the counter of the Hamburg harbor pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher percentage drinks to attract the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis also drink courage for the obligatory singing inserts.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Badest Day".
The Municher did not get well in the high north.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely bruised on it, his eyes only two little slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some insights - probably not very serious - that he has now gained: "Rule one: does NOT go to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also let go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the afterlife.
They were supplied with instant broths, fish breads or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinemastar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night’s supply, it is not known yet.
Since she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be significantly more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and betrayal
The entrance to the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa presents itself difficult to invent and is muddy.
Recipes against grazing vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Scissors, cigarette chickens, garbage and fraud, demolished waste buckets and now disassembled notice signs - this has been the case for long periods of entry with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
For the showable object Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than illustrious sight.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC site group Schwalmstadt but also others for a longer time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed by the Radkehrsbeilderaad.
There has been no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
It is not only loud and loud, but it is also destroyed in the layers: plasters are ripped from the earth, garbage bins are demolished, signs are bent, seat furniture is shattered.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions were, however, only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is the meeting point for storage.
"During the entire cycle path there is clearly the focus of the Haaße-Hügel", confirmed by the cycling commissioner, who is now also taking care of the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this puts the threshold much higher to tap into common property.
This would, however, assume that a police strike will come by in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the hare hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far could be very satisfactory.
Tourism marketing is still capable of expansion.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne takes stock of the situation on Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning-off on the hare hill.
In the case of regular traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially children.
Music-Contest at Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music Contest for Big and Young, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with blindfolds in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family of coffee and cakes from the honorary staff of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations began, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachtener in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten of Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackties.
This contest, according to Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen this in other parts of town.
What were the texts associated with?
The Hiltruper lake and the market outlet were particularly often mentioned in the towns.
Rolf Ihmig, in his song "Kö von Hiltrup", named the Allee.
The cultural station was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing one another in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short rest periods with short interviews with the performers or clues about their work.
So one learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a big event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed on YouTube all the time.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can listen to their songs too.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup battle, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice appearance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like everyone else, the children also appeared at the final - and even sounded "right good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, access to the melody and recognizability.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The District offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a full success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural train station.
The word game: "decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords that you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - once you put it in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, on the cards you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4th Feast".
These are the terms that it is used to encrypt.
For it is not the terms here that should be guessed, but codes.
In turn, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2".
In "decrypto" should be guessed not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "Dice", "Fest" and "Window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and that the opposing team is not as much as possible; for it wins the game if it succeeds twice in breaking the code.
The cipher thus notes and reads loudly: "Dial" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he took care of the school and knew the fall of the window there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you don't know the terms of the opposite side - but this can be more closely connected with any hint given by the cipher there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not too distorted, so the rewritings should be, otherwise you make it unnecessary for his team.
The most cryptic of "decrypto" is the rule book.
The participants probably have to study it for quite a long time and in-depth until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But anyone who has started will be fascinated by how much the feeling is in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as the predecessor and genre prime "codenames", which also an agent theme on a game uses less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And to whom it is just about guessing and not about victory points, it can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler's greeting and harasss guests in the Kneip
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach during the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
First he showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, and later he also fell into a pub in the Upper City when he conjured other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the prison cell.
In the sobering state, he must then also take criminal responsibility for the use of identifiers of unconstitutional organizations.
The Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
The station in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, they heard it all in Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't make any sense.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons knattered.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that stand figuratively for Dinkel's home Presig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so influenced by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres in height, has its tipping point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, former train and drawer blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, train route and railway mastery.
"Heartpiece was the turntable, which after a conversion in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschiid, railway historians and 47 years of professional railway.
Pressig (BW) station, which was placed under Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben districts.
On 15 July 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the 1939 track already minimized the need for train and drawer blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10 000 weighings were placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were cut off, and in 1991 the rest were cut off.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not seen a better use of the site, even in freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railways Directorate celebrated the 50th anniversary of electrification in Nuremberg - Saalfeld, a pompous railway station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Not long after that.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig yard was history.
"The rangers and boot loaders did the most difficult work in the train," Dinkel recalls.
Every misbehaviour would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Presig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the return of Hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the affectedPlus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russians placed at number 13.
The Schwabine is now getting to do with Amett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekends during the series "Kunst und Genuss".
With great ease registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather, when the property Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, opened the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance".
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Round ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor engagement showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 examples of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who became the main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprising but some days ago Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his job in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already played an active role in the selection of artists and have contributed to Flyer.
This year, again, there is a 70-cent special letter brand designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at every art station.
There, this year's poster "Betzn Austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high acceptance of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was won for the musical setting.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes clear that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfully.
It is made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened, playful with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 alu tubes provided as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object appears fairy-talely fabricated and invites to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Washneck, who prefers to dedicate himself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
Half way through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "Windspiel-Performance" is to learn through the versatile art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018, the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singer celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And at that time the albachtenians also made their insolent air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to partout because after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 albachten from the Baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "house of meeting".
"It will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstige, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.
They had revived the foundation festival, especially at the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
In time for the 50th anniversary, the festival was back.
An elegant ball was asked for festive clothing.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "house of meeting" in sitting rows, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was excited: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the controls and asked for the dance surface.
It is an honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten heard the voice themselves.
In line with the occasion, happy songs were popular.
Almost already set: "Like a day, as beautiful as today".
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Redsheimer Wein".
In alluding to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "Hoppen".
Again sovereign was the choir lead by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at that time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstige said, "He has such a light way, it's a master performance he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves as singers.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest whose repertoire includes above all Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhythm.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented eloquent poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to fund a visit to the Allwetterzoo to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber's marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really good in Liga Three.
No trace of shyness or fracking sauces that the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the some satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied". On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game stopped.
Yes, the result is actually an optical deception.
In the third sentence the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the goal, such a game can crouch," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, with its routine powers, the USC made clear everything and brought the full profits into the finish.
"Everyone is aware of who stands in such a derby on the other side.
It's not gonna break our necks.
I have seen a really good volleyball at times," Annacker did not hate the 0:3 and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents, after just three days of playing seems not to be foreseeable.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga volleyball this is not nearly comparable." In the fourth league they do not want to look down anyway.
If the West is not polluted in the next few weeks, they need to look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday it's not until Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the dream ship.
Now she openly speaks of the series as having a share of her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01st, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series, which made her star, could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues came to my attention," says Keller in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
First of all, she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her then husband could have been quite envious, but "how many men also shone Hans' conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only one right and he wanted to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I changed my mind", as she explains.
She always felt like "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, who I was never truly, even though I appeared on stage sometimes bold and courageous.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes, "although I was afraid it might go wrong a second time."
On the day before the official wedding, I sat in the closet crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller introduced love back then "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've gone way too naively to love."
The night-paddler, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the Zurich NZZ resort, dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our father is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the glimmer in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-sleeved square fades it over a fee.
But it's a film festival, because more or less famous people want to be sung in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he dries over the square to facilitate himself briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is how the public toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company are called, which celebrates their premiere at the festival: The needy institutions in the parterre of a new pavilion make a lot of effort to pour out a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, across the other street side: Invited guests who have just held the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next to the opening film at the best level, celebrate the festival beginning each year with a party in the three-storey department store.
This name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown come from the whole globe.
What you don't have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into sleigh advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The trap binds a belt around the feelers who have put a good fairy in him, and two bully doorsteppers actually wave him generously in.
Inside, the invited ones push themselves, dance well after midnight to live music or let themselves be pretended by DJ rhythms, to which they are yelling at each other, and rinse down with cuppi exquisite hippies.
In the delicacies shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for smoldering mouths, next door is cut up the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello, a chocolate well is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The boy studies the sign at the escalator: "Put on a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If the two are separate instructions, he has moved in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional structure, and it certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the wing tipped a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been selling the brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there is a face, known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It's not likely that his main actor will be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not squandered, he's not gagged, he's tossed at most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a clairvoyance, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have made a good start in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second league player had defeated the Leones Negros by 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last-Minute-Pleitse "destroyed to the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association ligalist ASV, could hardly believe it: "So such a bitter defeat". His captors were "damaged to the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played poorly over long phases, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we've totally slept," the ASV trainer became annoyed.
Soon the houselors led with 8:1, also the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not at first fruit.
"Then a team suddenly passed through the back," Bieletzki gathered the second quarter of an hour.
During the break, the residue was only two goals.
Most of all, sending best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase some other time.
After the change, it became even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst went to 15:15, and then the season changer almost went through.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Intercede with the impartial in the event.
Bieletzki usually guard against looking for guilt in others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had well laughed and met up to the end four times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood against seven men well and thrown on the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy themselves little for the compliments.
"Now it must be a fucking victory," says Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlödl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kumper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Elongation (1).
Bavaria: missing woman for 30 years - Police digging for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof) the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Staff on Saturday at Marxgrün found a street.
To this end, the streets and several strata were decommissioned, as police and prosecutors shared.
New insights suggest that the missing persons might not have been buried far away from their home at that time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at that time either.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Public Prosecutor's Office, has been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority, the investigators met with a ground radar on an uprising under the street near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials restricted the position to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are lurking in the web.
However, users can also provide additional security for themselves.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates should be installed quickly, for example for Windows, and it is not harmful to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threat as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC extrajudicially contributed a dispute over misleading Twitter news reports in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million per year, and Musk gives up the Chair for three years, a similar position to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He must remain opposed to this.
In comparison, which must be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted malpractice.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in front of the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also presides over space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed in the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share, which is secured.
This would have cost Tesla a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla stay on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside Chairman, appoint two independent members of the Executive Board and also set up a committee that monitors Musk's communication.

Surveys: 46 percent did not want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After last weeks' querels, the GroKo collects several survey gaps.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far on Sunday's trend.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP reach 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
The great coalition has thus lost the majority on Sunday's issue at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties come consistently to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allebach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election they received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties the band is also large: the AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the proportion of votes.
But also the detention for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the Bundestag elections in 2017.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office of chancellor, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS showed.
According to the survey, only each second (50 percent) currently wishes to see the large coalition hold in three years until the next regular election of the Bundestag. 41 percent are for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there had been significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also consider split up whether Merkel should run again for the CDU Presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are opposed to 44 percent.
Thus, 64% of Union citizens want a candidate, 35% do not.
Curfew at Aldi: Price Reduced for Love Happiness
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says, in times of Tinder, there are no more romantic knowledge stories - he should talk about powdered meat at Aldi once.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as an introductory place for great love almost exudes anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced powdered meat, boxer short snacks on the wohl table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than just a hip to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, not talking about the hot breezy for long in the first news?
Here's the amazing result.
It's right-wing Hollywood Lovestory potential when love happiness precedes a lost-eye-and-recovered plot.
If the guy reports even under the email address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de to his adored one, then it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi-Fillale to wish that they will find their traffic jam, with which they have entertained briefly about the "30 percent reduced bio-poultry" meat.

Picture deck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has participated in the action "Deckel versus Polio - 500 lids for a life without children's paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease referred to in German as child paralysis leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, Polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be controlled by vaccinations, as it is said in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Godze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to public discussion about the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," said the God-friended Reus after the 4:2 win in Leverkusen at the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.

"But it will certainly give us the moment we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening at the TV station Sky.
Football: District League: Researchers appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, then Alois Fetsch went hard into court with his own.
He gave himself to coach VfL Wolbeck, the football district attorney, only (innerly) withdrew to repent of the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it's running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only hauchdünn was scrapped by the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
"We made the spaces tight and exerted pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out every single person for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
After 26 minutes, the coach had to make a system change.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went out of the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs missed the tour before he left (17th), who changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th).
Almost this would have happened when the SCA struck in minutes 41 twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbämer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Kasten - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL frequently took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed barely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the inflection of Miles Geske, the left side of the fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbämer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the place masters 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The foal itself began and demonstrated its danger to standards.
Westhues" Ding with the right sleigh hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to be damned long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally flew the leather in the penal room to hand in the 80th minute.
Arbitration judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase, before the ghost had the victory hit on the pussy in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Page), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of playing - that was not enough for Coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht wanted to make Frankfurt the first home win.
Sturdy Ante Rebic, who was in the Startelf for the first time after an injury, should help.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing, an accident occurred on the airfield.
The four inmates were easily injured.
Around 14 o'clock on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn came to a drama.
When a helicopter was landed, turbulence occurred, as confirmed by the police against oe24.
The heli was captured by a wind buoy, powered to the ground and came to the ground on the side.
Police, rescue and firemen were immediately informed.
The forces came to the scene with a large command.
The ÖAMTC-notarzthubschrauber was also called for caution.
Inhabitants only easily injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage to things.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The precise circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigations.
According to fireman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire of origin, but it could be quickly erased again.
Report from the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate boards
This meant that only 8 percent of the executives on the deadline of 1 September were female, as stated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and presented to the German press agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said founding manager Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, male-occupied executives - with only a few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the small increase in the share of women among German stock exchanges was only due to positive impulses in the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the directors are female.
In the previous year, however, the value remained at 3.8 percent.
Over the past few years, the women's share of the 30 Dax companies - the pioneers - has stagnated.
Twenty-six women worked in the Boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will be recruiting more consistent women in their own interest next year," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they continue to take no self-commitment to increase the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is available from the supervisory board: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 per cent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"The annual recruitment of women for the Boards would have reached 40 per cent in 2023," says the report.
Some even make Miese: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.

Those who make the most profits per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers pay per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenöffer have worked with this question.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit in the first half of the year with every car sold 69.000 euros - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes up to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley put on even every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train for the opening of the 60th abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the Tourist Association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the club organizes the wine festivals, which continue every Saturday in October in the large festivities on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the leaders moved through the place to the festival place among the sounds of the playwright's train from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the Tourism Association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already crowded festival tent. "60 years of this kind – this is an amazing performance for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later symbolically approached the guests from the stage.
"I'm glad so many have found the way back to us after Abtswind." Later, "The Troglaus" provided atmosphere.
On Sunday, on which the Kirchweih abtswinder was also celebrated, the club had set the prices of drinks as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A feast evening at the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the house of the guest, before it goes into the second round one day later in the feast tent.
In Bonn: notary car power in taxi
An emergency car is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passantin was fatally injured in the collision of the commercial vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best save even human lives.
Such a rescue took a fatal end to a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an emergency medical car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red light light on Saturday afternoon and Martinshorn.
He then met up on a crossroads with the taxi that drove at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car swept against an ampelmat and a tree.
He recorded the passanthin who died at the site of the accident.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were badly injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from force.
The emergency doctor, who was also severely injured in 29 years of age, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three severely injured were brought into hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonner Public Prosecutor's Office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we it tireless
After the blamable out in the league, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, Manu is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat is still to be spoken.
The scene at the 74th minute, in which the re-healed Marko Arnautovic for West Ham was shot the 3:1 shot; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an outside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all Manchester defensemen stood, and Arnautovic allowed all the time in the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative peak of an insufficient performance already over long distances.
At present, it is quite different from United City Rivale Manchester City.
Pep Guardiola's big competitor, who was trained by Mourinhos, won an approximate 2:0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's restraint for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the formal goalkeeper Sergio Agüero provided for the securing of the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the leap to the top of the table.
Liverpool No More Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 fight against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
The Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The match of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only match of the game until the end.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
It was better for Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his sleigh.
So after the speeches started with a flawless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the Blues Liverpool crashed from the top of the table by means of the remis in the league.
Like City, the two London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 victory.
The fans of the Gunners, during which Granit Xhaka went through, however, had to wait until the 81st minute against the team of surprises from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart bended a herein by Alex Iwobi unhappyly into his own gate, just two minutes later, Mesut Özil with his third season hit the decision.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth consecutive win, passed Watford and is just behind the big rival Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression remains climber Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeated at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth consecutive time and took 8th place.
VW nuclear brand missing: Paris car salon in sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not be released by the German car companies even at the Paris industry meeting.
From next week, at the 2018 Motor Show they will show their novelties together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel doesn't really matter much anymore.
The possible replacement and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, however, should still be an important topic at least behind the gleaming scenes of the booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models: the etron of Ingolstadter is expected to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented, however, already.
The iNext of BMW is due to start in 2021.
The new 3s are at the centre of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well over a million visitors came.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
dozens of people are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured people.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, there were enormous damage to the material.
After the quake the Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still clearly on the increase.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other communities - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
Some 150 Bikers Celebrate Worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcyclists at the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the mental care of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike god service (MoGo) at the house of Nordhjelle will always take place on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m. onward, the Bolidens were set up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First, the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a daring curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were present.
The sermon was held during the biker god service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer Valerie Lill, who was a singer and singer-songwriter, took care of the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetically quiet tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorbike Gods service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big festival: The milk comes after the apple
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his amazing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the children the field and let them fill the apples in the great funnels.
With a little muscle power a finely crushed mass was drawn from the apples.
Still, many of the children probably could not imagine how a tasty drink of it was to be made.
But they were able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered with nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the a little piece of apple for layer over each other, looking like a hedged piece of apple.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually entered a large container.
However, the farmer had already completed specialities in it.
So he opened his "Schatzkaste" and presented the older visitors to the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press, but also discover the built-up hop castle for themselves.
Active of the Füchtorfer Comradeship of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited some stations to play short.
The home club will also offer an action day in the coming year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the topic on hand: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season lead: "Biffissen Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 around him and spoke to them about courage.
However, there was a lot of positive things to be seen before at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "Of course, that's disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further segloses of Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for connection, stand with two counters at the very bottom and are in their momentary constitution a descent candidate.
On the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first victory for the season, led by Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in his launch debut almost in every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse and never to get hold of Hanover's defense.
The storms long struck after the World Cup showed with their speed and perseverance why it is so valuable to enter.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, which was loaned by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began in swing.
A headball falsified on Lucas Torró's main network (17th) led to the first danger.
Six minutes later Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (backs).
The leadership of the masters fell almost compulsively and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penalty room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who thought himself through skillfully and left no chance for 96-tort Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hannover Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak conception of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony played a bit braver towards the front, but burning ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the connection hit.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, which had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only too crowded for the Frankfurters, but Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes the party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, good atmosphere prevailed at the October festival in the city center.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter succeeded in opening the 185 million audience.
Municher Wies'n last week with two beatings.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian Celebrate Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or on Sunday thereafter.
The service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the finale.
The Holy Cross church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and who is supposed to have shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
From the shot wound, blood flowed.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross church.
This is not yet finished, only the altar room is standing, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance of the Geisinger parish, the service was badly visited.
After the divine service, the procession took place for the Church of the Holy Cross and ended with the end of the ecclesiastical part of the Crusade.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has then invited the worldly part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choir members supplied the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon the parish church offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows on behalf of the parish church, as well as the construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damages could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, as the damage that has already occurred a few years ago has become larger, but more has been found, which has only been possible through the inaccuracy by means of scaffolding.
The pedigree work is completed, the natural stone work is due to begin before winter and half of these works are hoped to be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller life support opens a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" will now be handed over to his destination in the Münsterblickstraße - all present agreed on the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have lived in the residence of the life support Donau-Iller for some time have depended on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test bench for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators went to tear off the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Donau-Iller's life support opens new residential home
Some 4.6 million euros invested life support in the new building.
The Free State taxed 2.4 million euros, the Schwaben district 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained in the planned frame - both time and financial.
He was also thanked by the managing director of life support, Jürgen Heinz.
The space between a barrier-free and simultaneously fireproof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements, allowing the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
In a similar vein, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents who need help to be mobile".
The apartment and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And on: "The property in this situation is a real happiness, because it is no longer possible to acquire it in today's situation".
In total, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers space of almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three living groups.
Pride is the life-help manager Heinz to the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Controversy between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the vice-president of the SPD Manuela Schwesig appealed to all the compatriots not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt unity after almost 30 years.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The aim had to remain the same throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year-old pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In the effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjongyang has made Moon Jae the South Korean President a gift in two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their destination already on Thursday.
They then passed along the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed in order to make it easier for the animals to "be accustomed".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Cultural Property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift had announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pjöngyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
It is quite different from Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Picturerbuch" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to the work in hand - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition's working week that is to begin today.
Almost an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not last mantra-like the "return to expertise".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other active citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work in kind, but it is.
If the Federal Government is now ready to once again devote itself to its mission - the government - then it should not be held aside with debates on terms.
Whether Union and SPD can do something together after the provocations and blasts of the last few weeks will perhaps show Monday.
In the evening, the Heads of Government meet at the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, conflict-affecting issues are again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the law on immigration.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies with exchange premiums slip through, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has taken place in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned Labour Force Act.
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "transition of traces" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be dispute again among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has joined the GroKo, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Fight's good.
Without dispute, a society that is so diverse and sometimes contradictory does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, the dispute must not be rebuilt for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or being.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to fight - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the rail changes question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus, trust can be regained.
That is why the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister of the Visitors
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"In fact, day and night" had their lawyers worked on social security reform, a superfluous social minister reported on the presentation of the same thing two weeks ago.
At list-pilz-mandator Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger's (FPÖ) statement is a surprise - it now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumed, "that the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about her team's engagement and that he would not in any way declare violations of applicable service law against ongoing cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "exempt every suspicion".
Police are tearing a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgroen - Lange didn't want the police to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is dug.
The line is blocked in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had used an archeology dog.
The dog specifically trained for the smell of old human bones could eventually limit the relevant spot to a few meters along with its leader in multiple use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year, prosecutors and criminal police have been working on the missing case.
Again and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and was examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that here, in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago, Heike's body could have been torn apart.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the disputed independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But before it comes to Krawallen.
The Separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there have been clashes between separatists and the police in Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by the independence advocates with color powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guards.
Some 3,000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally, who last year were employed in the polls as an illegal referendum.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also taken place at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to separate the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces, reported Spanish media.
Some of the 6,000 separatists would then have tried forcefully to break through the police chain, and the officials would have thrown paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people had been arrested, 24 more had been easily injured, called the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
Carles Puigdemont, then regional president, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government at the time and other activists of the Separatist movement remain in U-Haft.
In December, the new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the Forced Administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra consists of the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Soccer: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 difference.
The final light and the third, they appeared before 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as a ralliance.
The first half was easily overseeable by the entertainment factor.
Those who would rather get a beer or a roast sausage could do so unconcerned.
There was no danger of missing a Torchance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour.
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and, in principle, only real - had the Ahlenes, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced them to parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border of the penitentiary.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for which Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ballooning by Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fast.
The rapidly presented account about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a but a shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a head ball by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by former Ahler Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interim Trainer Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners failed to achieve.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to spread out the positive: "I like that we have played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero has also stood at the front.
"This time, we were not as dangerous as we were against wooden coils and even though our opponent didn't want to play with us," said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensive "everything was such a bit" against a team "who only wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get an opponent," said Daut.
As a spectator, however, one did not feel that his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table edition office for which these donations are intended.
The honoraries assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well".
At the opening the sky was shining blue, the place was still a little empty, but that should change during the day.
Because, "Here it is so nice to meet you, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a decent price humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" was not to be taken by musically entertaining the more and more visitors.
This was so good that a few folk songs were sung at later.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many activities with their stalls, including mostly clubs.
"In fact, there should not be anything like a tablet at all," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here something goes.
Then the Maikranz was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarter.
At many stands was worked for the bodily well-being.
It was all to have from sweet to hearty.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for one year, became creative on his decupier saw.
Furnace work, beer lid with reckenfelder motifs and some more he had in offer.
A speciality offered three reckenfelder bemker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Büschschschschluter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so tasted the cake.
It is the happiness that allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skating facilities
In Lengerich, unknowns have probably hardly promoted the construction of a skate system.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration upon request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal prosecution has been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were spelled on signposts, among other things, at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that after the professional election fair on September 19th, a corresponding letter had already been discovered on the sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an oath at the time, it could have been easily removed.
"A few days later, however, that was again there, this time, sparked up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding billboard must be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
It has already been promised, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of school, sport and culture, without naming.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the scale.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of skating facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council expressed its views on the fire station in the majority of cases.
However, this suggestion was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the area of Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then has the City Council.
He left a decision this year so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic traffic congestion is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year after the European air traffic operator in summer.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, the German press agency in front of the air traffic summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for finished-trained pilots is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that several air transport trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday in Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal state, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not work without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German air traffic control system.
Maas once again made the EU Commission's targets responsible for the pilots.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting costs and staff savings in national air navigation services are now fully operational.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "don't cut the air any further" the air services.
At present, EU regulations would be voted by 2024 and further tightening would be to be feared.
The EU was constantly under pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped exactly what they themselves have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs of the airlines could lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years is very rich in order to compensate for the age-related declines.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Agrees for Group Conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for the conversion of the Group.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Manager Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the Sunday meeting, the Christian Group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional cut in staff beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
This represents ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 per cent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG the business is to be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at Demos by police and Catalan supporters.
At two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent confrontations with many victims.
According to the City Administration, some 3,000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large bid to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the officials, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throw shots.
According to rankings, there were also indications of between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and Members' valuation
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to honor the colleagues who had taken action almost a year ago against the Spanish Central Government's independence referendum in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt that it was a provocation for the Spanish police to demonstrate in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Only to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threatened us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, repudiated the allegation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because that is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of the British Minister
A security gap with a mobile phone app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory party day in Birmingham.
Two people stuck on B217
On Sunday morning, the police in Hanover reported a heavy traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The forces of operation are on site.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldos best game
This evening, the Portuguese Star Stormer "played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star bought was also without its own goal the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does well," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three goal pieces by Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retirement through the hits of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst chaser for the first time.
The Torjäger, taken by Real Madrid, initially posted Mario Mandzukic, the former German professional, who led with a double pack (26/49.).
And Ronaldo also made the preliminary work on the hit by defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
But Allegri wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record goalkeeper.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve-Torschützer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' supremacy seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points the master of the past seven years already has six counter jumps on Naples.
The tabular range trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without any chance against Turin.
But at the latest after Mario Rui, who had already been confused (58th), was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square after too hard.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin Coach.
He was also allowed to feel Emre Can.
The German national player has won the title at Juve.
The professional who came from the FC Liverpool was in use at all seven league parties.
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown from the place on the 2nd win of the Turiners and was locked against Young Boys Bern for home play on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly ludicrous appearance, Rapper Kanye West paid attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump provided a mineral water costume for forehead rakes and question mark at the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album.
The only way to call him "Ye," says the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in line with the late singer Prince when he gave his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under that name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hotmar's coach Averhage did not make a hench out of his disappointment.
This was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more tacky, we've put him as good as never before in trouble." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's shots reads.
Grade two Torch Chances in 90 minutes, so it is rarely possible to make games positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first pass, the first but used Maik Krause from an acute angle to the early lead (7.).
At the 43rd minute Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after a great preliminary work by Krause he dislocated freely.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master in the post-age Jan Blome in the stationhorst Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticised ourselves before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Towers: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelfüßball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he ranked by words.
"We don't have access to them at all." With that he probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably all the other green-whites that were coming up with a collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, waving cheeks and pulled from his players then, the relief was to note that they had withdrawn three points from the affair.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays to the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights to the classhold.
GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him with understandable mixed feelings.
"This was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we hold against one of the league's top teams throughout the game, that was already really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts in the lead with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed above the left side patternable for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew this, but you can't take such a player out completely.
"That was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the turn of the page, his own eleven managed to compensate: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torschüter Hinkerohe into the long Toreck (45.).
After the change of sides, it was McGill again who achieved the balance (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nübel again shocked Albachten (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to return to the last Concordia meeting (80.).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepskins, that's what we now have to win," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonne (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zimner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Rot: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and at the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Soccer-Zweibligist Dynamo Dresden resigned.
In the evening, several media came to refer to a joint letter from the Saxe Board.
A confirmation of the association was initially not available.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides such great relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until mid next year.
France's President Emmanuel Macron has thus signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: he was not a federal president in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there.
As he proudly said, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That the academy at the Tutzing Castle repeatedly appeared prominently, but was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songmaker Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings by mid 2019 will take place.
"The pension is not safe!" stands in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Armed Deals, Destruction, Torture, Death - the War repudiates every humane idea".
From structural racism in society to the division between the poor and the Reich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Akademie-Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx's birthday shortly awaits a more visitor in the direction of capitalism-criticism, the others rather a tendency "from the outside of the left to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret girl, Teubner developed the understanding of gender, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeled) woman and (feeled) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrup sat on the wing.
On the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to terms until the end of the sentence, on the other hand, is a true pianist: So royal harmoniously accompanied Suverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, as it suited to the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner put a paradox into play: The satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but he doesn't open the door.
A closed door without a partner on the other hand brings no benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have escaped Mozart's composition, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
In improvisations, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Suffer of Death", and from Mozart g-Moll Symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.

But the chairman of Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea of enjoying the duo alongside appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

The disputed tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain head of the Board of Management at the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but must give the chairmanship of the Board of Directors.
Musk also agreed with the US exchange supervision SEC to pay a double-digit million penalty, as the SEC announced.
Background is Musk's surprising announcement of August to want to take Tesla from the stock exchange.
The SEC appealed to Musk in its action to have made false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus crash on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the number of victims down.
10 passengers instead of 15 had been easily injured.
Everyone's been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.
He'd be released in the course of the day, said a police spokesperson.
The cause for the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the Fernbus was unbraked at the front against a leitplanke.
Handball: Women-Landesliga: Ahlener SG retains against TV Waddenscheid barely the white vest
The Ahalene women had problems with third-party player Caroline Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"In fact, I was well pleased with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get them," said ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he became more angry at the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the conclusion made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a backward position, lay at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only in the end did the wider bank of the host women become decisively aware.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extreme clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV East Beaver at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV East Bevern have again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
When VC Allbau had a second-liga finisher, the blue-whites won 3:1.
"That was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said Trainer Dominik Münch, looking forward to an almost impeccable performance of his team at the overthrown table leader.
The first pass almost dominated the guests as desired.
He went over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 at 25:15 to the vice-masters of the previous year.
Food was accepted in the double bar, but it didn't come into play.
We've worked them well.
Our opponent has turned up at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "Essen has switched the acceptance to three bars.
We couldn't keep the pressure on.
Food sucked, and we let ourselves get a little drunk," Münch continued.
At 18:17 the volleyballers from the Ruhr area had their noses in front for the first time.
At 19:24 Ostbevern resisted four more balls, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," the manager found to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silke contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet to 25:21 in the third section of 14:16.
Münch: "There we played consistently and quietly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-White passed four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also achieved an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the great Ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the Mosque opening in Cologne has left behind a cluster of shards that can only be put together effortlessly," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Besides Germany's top politicians, Erdogan has used the date to underline the affiliation of Muslims to Germany," lamented Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "enhanced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already established
After the long summer break, folktreff time is finally again.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth notable folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost every day, it's a year ago that we've had a folk meet for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our people's hits would flash so fast in Etuln eta.
No matter whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of Amtmannei was always filled.
"The program at the next folk meet is as always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends and musicians to meet him again and again.
Klaus Spelmeyer promised his first birthday with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the Steinfurt district that played music with flat German lyrics for many years.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the folk meet remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz of Folkstreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frösche at night", enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a happy and humorous evening again," says the home club's invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get involved actively is invited to participate.
Since the requested seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there in sufficient time.
The crowd meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, informed Linde on Sunday.
In this way, the permits in South Korea and, as the largest obstacle, in the United States are still valid for the billion-dollar merger.
Last time there, the odds of consenting to an insider had improved because Linde had promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the district association for horticulture and country care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulsions for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
In 1893 he was raised from the Baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa, a district fruit-growing association known as Kulmbach City and Land.
Also the purpose of the fruit-building association was different from today's work - it was actually purely fruit-making, flowers and gardening, no one thought at that time.
"At that time, at the time of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive talk.
Fruit trees should elongate long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
The Obstanbau is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprises almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the conveyance of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulworfe" showed how diverse the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"The youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said CEO Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of natural experiences for life.
The chestnut collection was a big thing for us children, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. you can gain similar joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the county council decides," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The circuit board stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt about this, also the circuit executive and expert counsellor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come out of the garden, for the winter it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
" Nature has existed, it has already been there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," argued the expert on fruit and nut trees.
That's why it encourages the gardening associations not to let go so that our home stays beautiful and worth living.
It is also important to welcome the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian state association Wolfram Vaitl added.
"We have to stop the ecstatic decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif with the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to Naphta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister places UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in terms of Naphta: they make both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives the Trade Agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Naphta) was relaunched with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she concentrated on the renegotiation of Naphta.
The Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had declared on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States had 48 hours of time to agree if Canada actually wanted to accede to the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to re-establish the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Naphta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous streets in Hanover.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a mass attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report by the newspaper O Globo.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on open roads at the beginning of September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went on the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not"), women's associations in particular called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks too, the associations made racist and anti-frague statements mobile against Bolsonaros.
Several thousands of demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
Presidential elections in Brazil will take place on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the millions city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round reaches the absolute majority, there is an election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed in this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for fighting homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-85).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of the Left Workers' Party should be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
At his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om Nacht" from 1983 is the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honoured Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "the street boy", who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: Volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone put such a rewriting of the rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the city centre shoe factory: hard rock pure of three with another friend band.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - are enthusiastic about the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces of their own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to the vocal and expressive interaction.
Although "additional" calls are not to be overheard, leave "Tiger Bonesaw" the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock demonstrates guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classic rock of the 1970s remembering sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" there is also a synthesizer for the guitar rock at "Here We Stand".
Not only the longing, straight ballad "Take Me Home" impresses with the change of melodic passages to the guitar-ridden rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnish Ewes has, however, gained a special level of awareness since its inception in 2005.
The band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - has special stage experience is obvious and irresistible.
In conjunction with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the only enveloped song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
The guitar player Norbert Brinkmann delivers an overjoyed solo at the sound even more controlled than before, while running through the audience.
A certain amount of loudness is, of course, a matter of course: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the statement of the mixed-pult team, the three-concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the pressure hammer level, but it is still clearly below the controls of the "wake-fesitval", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need 120 decibels in nozzle volume as is usual in the annual metal plate dike in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced themselves with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A death in a sailplane accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport there has been a fatal accident.
In a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailplane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailplane had crashed on the fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot would have died.
As the "WAZ" continues, the student has been on board on his own - the pilot is supposed to be a resident.
The aircraft was already in flight at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a solid tent on the airport site.
But a October festival has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the border of the two Ruhr district towns and directly at the driveway to the 52 motorway.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events at the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump Himmet Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President North Korea's ruler Kim is well-balanced despite nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a true love statement to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has known himself as a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a remote connection.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in public on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost already tender words for the half-old spross of the ruling dynasty from Pjongyang, although in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament he proves to be quite tough cracks.
"I was tough, he too, and between us it went way back and forth," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me wonderful letters, great letters.
Her personal connection also bore political fruits: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics of the past see little more than lip confession.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - for his martyrly threat bearer might not be every memory, seemed quite conscious to the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of this when he appeared in a large sports hall in Wheeling City immediately in advance: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible is that?
It's so unpresidious.
But if he does not take care of this, Trump explained it and then directed his index finger to the crowd: "I have always told you it is so easy to be presidual".
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people outside pushing into this crowded arena, but we'd only have 200 people outside.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and upstairs pampered by sun filled: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city centre has plucked itself out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not only take place in the solid tent at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees saved thanks to video from libyschem Prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya by means of a mobile video, enabling their rescue.
The group had shot in its cell in the coastal city of Saviya in July under risk of life and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally deported to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya when attempting to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.
With the video, he was put at risk by his own words.
One of his associates was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the detention conditions had been catastrophic: "They all beat us with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year using the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now saved was not unusual in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone video help call yet.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of humanity.
The North African state, dominated by many militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised an burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building across the main entrance.
In the front house on the 1st floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a ladder to the ground floor or the courtyard.
The teacher informed the police who took the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether things or money have been stolen.
Description: ca. 16 years old, black, very short hair, a little darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.

Germans were caught in their own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to wait several days and nights in a forest area in central France in his car, after he had taken the car away from all the forest roads and blocked a tree the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, the police informed on Sunday.
According to the report, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported as missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man’s stay had remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls on the rule of law in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Lashet (CDU) has in conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after his own information the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This is particularly true of the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and religion.
He had therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to become normal in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey according to his own records.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport in the short term.
Originally it had to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected this from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country".
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the USA: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump will not tire of stressing the successes in negotiations on North Korea's denukularization, the East Asian regime is more sobering.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington's release.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for an atomic-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The recent stoppage is therefore that the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal to building trust," said Ri in New York.
An disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no way that we will first disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea to "knee" was "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an atomic test plant, Ri highlighted.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" on the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council had adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations over the past few days for strict enforcement of sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June Trump first met North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to revisit talks about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program to Pjöngyang.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth match, many visitors to the house of the open door HoT got nothing from it: white blankets and floral jewelry on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thank-you service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
It was not easy to start with the new facility, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the front: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's what everyone took.
The result could be seen, the guests were excited.
"Better can't cook it either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use Quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other works of art, gave astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of directors of NRW
Frustrated about criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, gave his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a stoppage for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice President of the NRW Boards, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I fell too many in my back.
The head of the NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, spoke about the dpa understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who did not know exactly why the Essen table does that."
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, there's nothing to change," said Weilerswiss.
Sartor again criticised colleagues from other panels in the "World on Sunday".
One must not follow the approach "without starving the people of the city".
It was the task of the State to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essenian did not participate in a conference of the tablets on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet dirt being told to me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that have criticized me so much at the time.

Alessandro Schöpf led the home quipe in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Jewgeni Konoplánka by head, and the hosts subsequently preserved the mini-polster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund boasts anew from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had dealt with Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half of the season it was still 4:2 win.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86.94.) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to fear against the Werder Bremen, which had been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the unobtrusive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curiose disposable owner that helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a fully successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave twice a lead out of the hand, played finally 2:2 and were still waiting for an outwind in the VW-City since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal league.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the 20-metre Aargauer surface, as was the second strike after an hour.
Nevertheless, Gladbach's tendencies are quite awe-inspiring.

After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart account that the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first match for the season, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serb cashed against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot after a jersey.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game through a curiose thrower owner (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end of the shot Gonzalo Castro, the Stuttgarters operating in excess returned to the victory street.

Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million people today agree on changing their country’s name to northern Macedonia.
If yes, the nearly three decades of swelling conflict with the neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had existed on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.

An Syrian brutally assaulted three pensioners and thereby severely injured them.
On Friday, the 41-year-old asylum seeker had rang at the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police came in, they spoke to the accused, who ran off on passersby with his fists and tried to attack them, to his behavior.
The Syrians then tried to beat and kick off the officers.
Little later, it turned out that the suspect had struck three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground shortly before on Währinger Street at a tram stop.
He had also stepped the trio with his feet.
In part, the pensioners were severely injured.
They suffered haematoma, breakdowns, and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also severely injured "out of still unknown cause", as the police said it was.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the marriage came into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them gave themselves the jaword.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesperson of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a rage on 30 June 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "traped" himself on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski motion," he referred to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, couples of the same sex can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
Garden day: 400 meter hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Bürgervereinung Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
About 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this in order to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Citizen's Association.
And it's been a lot of stuff.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now just a shape cut.
Because already in spring one had already shaved the hedge once.
Breakfast always followed by work has a long tradition as well.
"Everybody should keep up with it," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner brings gold to the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympia track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympia bronze for three hundred times.
I was well prepared, had already enough rides on the site and it was all right today," said the Olympic Third of London in 2012.
In the goal he threw his paddle away with joy and pulled both arms victoriously to the height - knowing that it would be worth at least a medal.
After all, he had his number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting mentions the first attempt at burglary this fall to a family house.
Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to use again.
Thus, yesterday, the police inspector Gauting mentioned the first attempt at burglary this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it has remained at the one-family house on Königswieser Straße.
That was when the perpetrators laid hands just before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they took refuge without any spoils.

Pleite bei Hertha: Retrieved from reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin "will not be let down" by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small power table under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase for the Munichers to the larger fall depth.
"A week ago, you had the impression, we're invincible.
Now we've got a bit of a reality," Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoying to us and that's why we're gasping for Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year out, no goal of its own, like at the same time of the preseason, was lost two compulsory games in series without victory, the tabling in the football League for the first time to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must still be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its race-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitching across the outside have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the last superpowerful Bayern have to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we'll do everything we can to make us succeed again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he gently changed with his losers in his birthplace and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the again deficient handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion to his term of office a positive outcome, otherwise the tone would probably get worse.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-run game against Ajax, which had also defeated AEK Athens with 3:0 for the start.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our gates again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost Cup Final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plain text.
The defenseman acted as a Mahner in the role.
"I don't think that's all bad, we'll have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavaria even had five counters behind Dortmund, which now took the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich, with a blindfold, valued at least positively that the public debate on the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in shot line: Ocill-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan on grindel
With serious accusations, the Turkish President Erdogan advocates an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the bond line.
A new post will now be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the high-precision in the permanent course theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the German ex-world champion at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB Chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, the Grindel in Mainzer ZDF-"Sportstudio" announced consequences from the Causa, which was personally attacked by Ozil.
"There we have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in U teams - that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and raised Mesut Özil in Germany and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domstadt.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who had risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Güntogan's statement that he felt "treated by the DFB" in contrast to Özil after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says, if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrants - I can't.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Ocill to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, which has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integrator is now to be appointed.
"If there is a person who is clearly involved in society and football without a migration background and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Ozil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to make her as good as I can," said Grindel.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the area of Lauter Height.
This one told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange since the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone call about a car driver who had come off the road and driven against a legpost.
Talked about it, the man didn't want the police on site and then drove off.
Afterwards the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has been in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has hit a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a terrible impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Nearly 1000 operating forces are still in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrands on a Federal Armed Forces site in Emsland, 980 operatives are still working on the fire extinguishers.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
Since the situation of a speaker is still stable, 70 volunteer helpers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of staff is planned, says the report.
On the night of Sunday, an earthly fire had been discovered and erased.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed well a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would endanger forests and settlements adjacent to the wind and sparkle.
On Thursday it was then said that an attack of the fire on adjacent communities no longer threatens.
In time, more than 1500 operations forces tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also information flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde left the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marriage came into force for everyone, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them gave themselves the jaword.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we get married, right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesperson of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a rage on 30 June 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "traped" himself on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski motion," he referred to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, couples of the same sex can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the highly expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
About 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the neighboring Greece.
For nearly three decades, Athens has been a means of pressure to block any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens agree with yes, they will also give the start for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be found in the case of a Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swiss transplantation.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a map be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You must then take a stand in the sense of the deceased to decide what is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar system of registration already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Federal Health Information Centre, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register where people can enter their wishes - per or versus organ donation," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has advocated a new system of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would be considered organ donors unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headcounts
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion.
He competed at the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 associates.
The Martina Flame-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, announced on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The most recent World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of 74 years old pensioner from France, as major referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which the participant approached against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel greet from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were already there two years ago when 14-year-olds in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or wonderchild, organizers can start loudly.
"Practical calculations can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadia-oriented computing competitions.
Among the disciplines, for example, is the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here, too, the Germans had good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage of being taught more intensively and with other effective methods already in early childhood.

Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can be snowed down to about 1,000 meters with a strong intensity, called it.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern it was expected to be above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjö, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start annual knickpflege on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start annual knickpflege on Monday.
The unique "green forests" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the woodland of the Federal Forest for some 200 years.
The tree and litter hedges up to five meters wide are "foresting" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks combine as corridors scattered habitats, which can still function as an exchange of organisms, as the Managing Director of the Naturschutzbund Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order by the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmer with firewood and beams for their specialist houses.
From that time his name "Knick" also comes: By "cracking" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, some 45 000 kilometres of the hedges stretch and give the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat of about 7,000 species of animals.
In one kilometer Knick could live up to 1800 different species and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he adds to a light tree series, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the effect of wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, crack care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
According to Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian, talk about local situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Were you on the spot during the tsunamis itself?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be imported.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of World Vision is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where do the people living on Sulawesi stop now?
Many have run on surrounding hills where they still have no access to water and food because of fear of another tsunami and earthquake.
Some of them stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food shops and also the gas stations are completely closed, people can partially steal food and gasoline.
The public service has completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
Also, a prison was destroyed, the prisoners were partially free and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island running?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we just got information about the radio.
Many people are still searching for their children, neighbors, and other people from whom they do not know whether they live and where they stop because people were not at home during the earthquake, but were on their way, for example, to work.
The Tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran on the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which is located on the Pacific fire ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

==References====External links==* Official website
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to recover the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympia Sprint of Pyeongchang to grab near the medal.
Seven tenths were missing on bronze at the end.
"I have consciously allowed time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the Constitution.
You'll have to hit someday.

Board Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the high-thin majority for the judge candidate board Kavanaugh, who is in dispute for forced accusations.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline until Friday for the investigators to clarify the alleged incidents that have occurred for more than 30 years.
The recent turn in the drama of Kavanaugh's vocation accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurist issued angry tirads against the opposition democrats, the Senate Judicial Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the U.S. Supreme Court judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
His party friends were willing to do so after scenes of dusk.
President Trump, who on Thursday still called the severe detentions "difficult," first contained further attacks against women and spoke on the contrary of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, last doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, in an election campaign, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply because they rejected Kavanaughh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump arranges an FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One was targeted to investigate the known allegations of two women, no more, said a government representative of the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going for a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to City municipality, the mobile radar unit of the Ried municipality, installed in a civil vehicle, is located on the garden road starting on Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season win.
However, against Mainz also the factor time played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - Now it is well known that Christian Heidelberg is a huge pessimist at football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penal room," said Schalke 04 sports director and breathed up.
After all, the king blues were still able to bring the barely 1:0 against the Rheinhesen over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and subject.
In fact, it could have come differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half-time was good, both playful and from pressing".
Not a headball monster, actually.
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me," said Heidelberg, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore moved on and on.
And defends against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said the creator, who had no essential part with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man's creation."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure at the beginning and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we've got to play games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest deficiency of the afternoon: King Blue missed it, rather for clearer circumstances to worry about.
The possibilities were finally there, for instance by the strong yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the latte 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor," Tedesco said, "You've felt the fear a bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scarf.
Fischbachau: Smoke column visible in the leitzachtal 2 km
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at about 13.30 a.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by police and fire brigade: An unknown person had lit up on a two-square-meter area at Gschwendner Berg Müll.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had been watching the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And that's close to the woods.
30 Fischbachauer Feuerwehrler were busy pulling apart and deleting.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafalani, is in front of them.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild repeatedly.
"I have been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance during the evening's orientation.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject.
With a lot of gesticism, hand-held numbers and one or another joke, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflict-rich topics: migration and integration.
Despite successful integration, why do conflicts increasingly arise?
The Syrian author is used to answer the question of a metaphor.
At one table the German society sits, at the cat'stic the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they were always sitting at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not crucial whether one decides politically to the right or to the left, but rather: "I am for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At the beginning, behave rather, then always louder the discussion starts.
And there is a need to speak.
From his perspective, an Afghan refugee tells two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing hour, he also became an open ear to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and casting win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home win and an away win.
Gießen fought against the Central German BC in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46).
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55-Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
Much more effort was made at the beginning of the new season of the German master Bayern Munich and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg.
On Friday Munich tried to win a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd building area on the free market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick tells us.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
About 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"Currently, the documents will be examined" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Mayor of Plieninger, the aim is to create the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the council.
After that, the award could be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the southern part of Landsham and four plots for multi-family houses with eight dwellings are expected.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads will soon be paved.
An individual plot and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of it on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multifamily houses of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living area.
Housing with a total of 16 income-oriented dwellings funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Largely estimated on the area of the new Landsham-South residential area for about 200 people is created.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start is made for the new construction of a daycare centre.
It is intended to accommodate three kindergarten and three group groups of cribs as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, for the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also succeeds at the bank
For the third time in a row, Naldo does not thank Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting on the exchange bench for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people, if the nearly two-meter Brazilians had spoken about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1:0 win over the FSV Mainz 05 and thanked Cheftrainer Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, all of whom call Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said: "We have to thank coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his reservist being, did not hold any grudge.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best schalker in the past season, knows that he hasn't actually got on the back track with his coach - but for good reasons gets a break.
A reason called load control.
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," Tedasco told him when he said Naldo that he wasn't in the startelf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we're all in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last captured Naldo as well.
And to whom the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by showing himself as an exemplary team player on the bank.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its valley ride in August compared with the Eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was at 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
However, Austria has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced its survey of 3,000 companies on Monday.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, and the index is nevertheless the 13th month in a row under the brand of 50 counters, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were the final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index of 44.0 points has reached the highest level since March.
"The slightly weakened valley journey could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry - in the third quarter anyway - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the Eurozone were no longer as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore built up jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production also decreased more than initially in August in China.
The mood barometer decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index is based on its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices are raised.
