What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditorie".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
Aktuálně.cz has members of the new council from the ČSSD once a little "slaped off" as they master the notorical serpent who has been a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the row.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Prague's political elite in the wasted era of Mayor Pavel Bém is one of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils were dipping something in the dark in relation to these new terms.
At least they claim that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer in Prague's policy," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, to the test of the "Paten-Wortschatzes".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use every now and again."
"Otherwise, I don't like snakes."
From the vocabulary published by the Tageblatt Aktuálně.cz in this year of June in front of the ODS Election Congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those associated with the Magistrate of Prague.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "greatest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry", "Stiencken", "treason of the capital" and "bleach".
Although three counsellors of Prague agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener away.
The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and I don't judge how civil democrats talk to each other."
"For me, it's important how we understand ourselves in our programs," he said.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized in the above headline that the speech is from the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only term he got correctly during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the security: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deduced not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for Environment Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Lukáš Plachý even imagines where this figure is to be found and thereby also what it means to "go into the pastry".
"I think that means going into some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, if you know that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have drawn these knowledge from the newspaper rather than to have it his own vocabulary.
In fact, there does not seem to be a similar civilized snake among the Social Democrats to judge the participants in the test.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something like this in us really not."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use shorts or nicknames," says the president of Prague's ČSSD Petr Hulinský - called "Hulda" by his party comrades Salopp.
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see where - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is kind to the party comrades of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by means of the party sponsorship, is called "Igráček" (known Czech lego figure).
So nicknames are the only one that allows the social democrats to use in the inner part of the language.
Hulínský apparently does not like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktualně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague Chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Knüppel Rights" allegedly involved Petr Hulínský acquiring his title Doctor juris at the Bratislave Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are stamped to witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are available and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women will be spared as they help with their work and give birth to children," a religious sister describes the situation that, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, takes care of by more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in a special home.
The local government now decided to oppose this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason, published a brochure that is supposed to suppress the "witch persecution".
But it's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," pointed the newspaper "the standard" to the dilemma of written information.
The accusation of witchcraft, however, is also prevalent in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they poured them over with petrol and just set them on fire.
This incident has also been reported by the server BBC.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil was ignited, which was used for ritual anointings.
After the group tried to "execute a bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fresser women of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunts, last year the President of the Republic of Zambia has himself mixed well with him.
"After his aunt's death, President Yahya Jammeh launched a monstrous witch hunt, as they allegedly participated in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"In addition, he called out to help shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, were brutally kidnapped by women and men who were forced to take them out of Albanian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the entangled people were forced to drink a debauchery of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but this also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
The client centre of the RPG Byty Company of the "Coal Baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic, is leaving an elderly man.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases for three apartments: for his own and for his daughters and for his son, who has just paid a sentence of imprisonment.
All three were increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" precisely the rent.
Instead of 3500 kroner, the son is scheduled to apply for a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns next year.
"And there's no running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal furnace," he tipped with his finger at the son's new lease for which he has a mandate.
"But what - I signed," he said half wrong and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Association, which called the new lease conditions "inappropriate and immoral", advises tenants not simply to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, on which they intend to publish an instruction on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man's just waving off.
"One says this, the other does," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic whose tenants do not pay market rentals.
Aktuálně.cz decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG storage room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Mite 2011", a special touchscreen button is illuminated.
Shortly tipped and already the device spits out a number tag.
We barely signed the number "157" and already beeped it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later you're in line.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava the envelopes with the new leases flatten most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG into the letterboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client centre is open since 18 November.
"The action is going on over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond for a moment when the "Client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mountain worker apartments are a brilliant theme.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had taken up this issue quite silently, no wonder that the newspapers today are full of them.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even ne. WC glasses could change them," the man mentioned at the outset made himself air.
According to the employees, above all pensioners are standing on the switch until now to see if they really get the promised rental discount that promises them RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who signed the new lease by 15 December will also benefit from a half-reduced February rental.
Until now, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overburdened by demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rentals in 2011 due to here," the switch officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites, as well as wall panels where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on his websites.
"No one is going to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her at least a partial right.
"I have 13,000 (krones) pension, of which 5,000 remain for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Well, then the employee's gonna be insecure.
"See."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so the people wait yet," she recalls.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic in New Year 2011 and RPG Byty states that the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," said Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is the main reason for the increase in rents, in the opinion of the home owners.
While RPG has been able to invest four billion in housing from the rentals taken between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Haviřov, in between, a few red glowing information appears.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square metre and month" can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
In 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not drive rents into height, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) want to put the company back into the apartments, especially in thermal savings - into new windows and into thermal insulation.
But - priority should be given to those people who sign the agreements on the tenant increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would already expect here a kindergarten, with everything that includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outside terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which studios have a number of renowned Brno buildings, estimated from the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company minikindergarten.
For the most part, most of his 90 employees are in the Babyboom age and the company is located on the ground that the projectors return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of her social program.
The engineers and architects have so much easier to put under control their demanding profession and child care.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech State budget.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be obtained and for a period of 2 years qualified personnel and operations were provided.
After the utilization of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to operate the Minikindergarten 3 for more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing strong assistance in the processing of applications.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day over several children changes from one another.
The kindergarten facility is flexible to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, especially they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, by the way, they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus avoid the stress of delaying children’s pick-up from a far-off kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder natural and loyal employer-employees-relationships develop here.
Arch.Design thus became one of the Czech companies that provided significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly, and which strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Check the interiors of Gaudi
The roof is shaped like the back of a prehistoric axe, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are torn-up fish mills.
This is Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the shed-like facades and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The façade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only when we look at it more closely that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
At night, the whole façade is still more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and intertwined shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, even holes and loops.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia Nr. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy Industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper conversion.
However, Antoni Gaudí was not the only owner of the Casa Batlló rental house.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were precisely on its edge.
However, numerous other artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's House Casa Milá in the Park Güell, where there are also other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms due to the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others in turn called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "additional house".
It is also said that at the very top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron of Catalonia.
But also other imagery elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system with ventilating channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
Something bizarre is already mooting their 45-degree slope.
Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at that time and could not be deceived by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained from the city the corresponding building permit but the information he provided on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city fathers were so deprived of the result that they demanded relief.
The Councillors, among other things, also pointed to the fact that construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, changes were no longer made, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the call of the district in question - and Josep Batlló made an application for approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The houseowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the 3rd floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for connecting rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could easily chat without having to refrain from a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house was also given a rather unusual roof and two other floors by Gaudí's reconstruction, besides a new façade.
Gaudí's game with the light is impressive as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courts.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The house owners decided not to take this step until the year and this was the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly one-sided business, the visits were maintained, yes, they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist badges get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have other wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the deck - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complementary in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
In the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattresses and rust are subject is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not suitable, as they need much longer to be "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they don't have enough venting ducts in the core and still lie on a solid plate, moisture is present: It is therefore not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Anyone who has spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft coating are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Whether all hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep here anymore."
"For their shelled shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these people, among other things, also sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why I've been getting many hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimises its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise it actually lubricates on the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, at night you don't roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the size of mattresses you should still add the length of the soles to the body, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
A man like a woman who is 180 cm tall needs a bed of 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should have a minimum width of 90 cm, i.e. 180 cm.
120 to 140 cm are fitted for single beds, e.g. single beds.
The comfort of half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master-in-chief of the upholstery and space equipment, who has devoted himself to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and has also presented this theme to technical schools.
With a double bed, each needs a private rust and its own mattress, but watch out when shopping, so that the mattresses are also equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains, but to install the rust at different heights and this is not possible at any bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which should be at least three centimeters to the shape layer and the fine padding.
"With the hand or during the arrest you must not feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully padded beds with mattresses and flooring such as cotted siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already going and giving today.
And as one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in one night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a giant (and stuffed sieve).
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even a lifetime guarantee.
Every thing has her if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from dealers: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not spare the hygiene of washable, retractable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress shoe that you can easily pull off and wash.
Even today, although mattress covers are usually made with round zippers, so that after opening you get two halves (immens important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid record in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable lattice roses with 14 to 18 spring bars (leads), always paying for rust with a larger latency number, i.e. from 28 and more spring bars, with Lordose support in the lumbar vertebral area and the possibility to regulate the latency hardness.
On adjustable lamellar roses do not include mattresses with spring skeletons, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also required.
This is a special fastening of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed or even tilted in such a way that they allow the pointless tin of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Namely for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft spaces for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, pointelastic wing sweeping systems (Lattoflex) or rust with pointelastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to the right mattress and real rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here again a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion appears, as it likes, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the side position, the head cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something to do with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials or at least their additions.
The new magic word "bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, polyurethane foams are increasingly used in the production of natural oils, such as castor oil and soya oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called in mattresses, which is its core of natural materials," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
But natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or foliage dust while sleeping.
Here, too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used for men to absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red paprika shoots stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm during sleep.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffs (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multizone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to scratch.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with less VAT, since they are considered as medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You can see saving on the mattress and on the rust isn't that easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the duofreeze mattress with hidden visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launch.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it fastens again.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
Therefore, it is not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special pads intended to facilitate legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of your own children is growing, and so more and more parents consider monitoring them via GPS.
The system, originally invented for car hire, can as well place people, which would be helpful in such cases, as it was only recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is about the size of a cigarette box at the moment, but it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and horror and thus keep them looking for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in the individual case there may be abuse of such devices, for example if you put it in your pocket without knowing it, but we had no such case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child is unable to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Very small children also show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"Just the phones started to wake up to the parents' expectations, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"When planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be placed."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices could be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sales would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to the company RC Monitoring, Roberta Čech offers location services both for cars and for people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a tilting knife is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning, stating the position," claims Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to record a special software.
The problem of current tracking devices is that it is either about machines in matchbox sizes that resemble trailers or about smaller phones.
There is always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, in the present day one is testing devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognise that it is a surveillance or positioning device.
"Or he doesn't notice what the police are giving a lead until a while," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - to bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used as in vehicle placement.
So to combine the tracking function with the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic you could hold but only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of ignition cords, and is lit with explosive inserts.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had delivered 224 kilometres of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the Aktiengesellschaft STV Group, a. s. for Lappische 40 million crowns.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the Generalstab MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 km of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of military pyrotechnics, the MF DNES referred to this statement, it is clear that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek were not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this too would be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts is that for the training of each new professional soldier, two metres of ignition is sufficient, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned - even in view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
In doing so, soldiers of the Rapid Reaction Brigade have recently complained to Vondra, Minister of Defense, that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that the shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't agree why they buy ignition cords like this from us."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we want to meet as a dealer," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition cordage with that the army would have covered itself with this "muniition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year term of use of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned may also be possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unannounced, in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the life of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's 244 km delivery," says spokesman Pejšek to inform us of the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison only: The annual consumption of ignition cords by policemen, liquidating ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brotherhood Army has hardly exceeded 1,500 metres for a few years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of their lifetime.
Even because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, one also keeps open the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords.
After all, the Ministry of Defence has enormous problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Chechoslovak People's Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyro technicians, the MF DNES addressed, the Czech armed forces expect in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they bought so "favorably" today.
To this day I find the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The winning position in the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winners of the last year of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success must be like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank credit, he created a buildable house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire winnings back into the house, which he then gradually converted to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open up four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the fourth hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties have already signed up for the franchise of the Pytlon hotels," says entrepreneur number one of last year.
"Great share of this license sale for operating hotels had just won in the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", adds Mr Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater familiarity, yes popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say that this was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at once either, every sighting is good.
He says that he is still benefiting from the contacts and acquaintances to which it would not otherwise have come at all.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relations to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also a little down to each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I really don't see this as just personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little bit in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first place of the competition Vodafone Company last year received Karel Ž
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts made by the small tool construction in Česká Skalice to stamp a company out of the ground that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this tribute not only encouraged me but also encouraged all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the struggle with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Ž
A short time later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all Central Europe.
But only because of the success in the competition mentioned and its medialization has it also become aware of the non-professional publicity.
"Not only do our customers perceive the Farmet brand significantly more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to attach greater value to the fact of working with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Ž
The last year, however, at Farmet was not only a sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which shook even less citizens at the time, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take up redundancies," explains Karel Ž
A viable company may also need to take such unpopular measures.
But it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to cut off - in investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won the main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Ž
Everything shows that we've overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish this new winner a lot of joy at victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Ž
An opinion poll that resolves with unreasonable rules
The opinion poll on "Absurdity of the Year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurship competition.
Some unwise regulations have already succeeded in creating them out of the world.
The questionable winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absoluteness of the Year" was the duty to create documents available online to authorities.
For example, more than a third of not quite four thousand voice-providing entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have obtained it by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the poll.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require deductions from the trade register in the case of social security checks," said ČSSZ Jana Buraňová spokesperson.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion poll "Absorbedness of the Year" is to put all the rules and regulations under the eye, to comply with the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to lift the unwise.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Economic Newspaper (HN) and is pleased with the growing popularity of the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, an eight-pointer position compared to the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was first proclaimed in the year and takes place each year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September of the competition.
To register, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition is looking for seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and allows the public to vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that most voices get.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless rules and regulations have been notified to this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to be provided every two years.
The list of this year's "Sieben" is published on the pages of the competition.
The call for competition at the Wenceslas Square in Prague at the beginning of November is part of a happening in which people of political and public life also regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the business into the middle of the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year that make the business more difficult for the entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create unreasonable arrangements from the world have proved effective.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the entrepreneurs imposed a duty to notify the commercial officer at the location of their permanent establishment three days in advance of the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation has been abolished by virtue of a amendment of the Commercial Law.
The obligation to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report missions of employees to the employment office to the extent of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales of persons in the speech room was adopted.
This regulation has been somewhat alleviated by the Ministry of Health this year - the duty to refrigerate was lost.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A new feature in this year's fifth year of the Competition of the Economic Newspaper (HN) is the category "Legally responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair businesses.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, Regional Manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebel of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company registered companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is for example about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera showed up, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for 17 years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady, for example, takes care of their health-impaired workers, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which they were honoured with the title "Responsible Company of the Middle Bohemian Region" and in the contest Vodafone Company of the Year, they took third place in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which included a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also paid tribute to the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the consequences of our business activities and administration for the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is based on the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired them with all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, as well as promoting their employees' home work and in corporate actions they use carting services offered by a home protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the "People in Distress" Foundation, which provides concrete help to the Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
It is also worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra buses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to catering, the way of work, increasing their qualifications and holiday," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category of responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the contest Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent them to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the betting companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "responsible company of the year", but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate application only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in public procurement
In the ground fund building in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have arrested in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was carried off by the detectives in handcuffs.
It allegedly attempted to manipulate a recent public competition for the settlement of claims for refunds in such a way that the plots offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
Luboš G. is said to have paid half a million.
"At that time, I can only confirm that the police are following a person in a public competition because of the crime of fraud," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo", she was unable to provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate on this given the limited official information.
The spokesperson of the Lubomír Černá Bodenfonds raised the question of Právo, which the police actually arrested in the Pilsner branch of the Soil Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and never about one of our employees," she pointed out.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct title "Requirements for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, in the context of the request, a higher value of their refund entitlements to be compensated by the transfer than the declared land value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential buyers is determined and then the Land Fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. was obviously at the disposal of information about who had signed up for the request and because he himself was a legitimate person because he had bought a number of refund claims, he offered a land interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat deposit.
This would also be an adequate explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Bodenfonds because he had been prosecuted for issuing land in replacement refunds for which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. acquired land intended for the construction of public roads from the ground fund, more specifically, in the place where the construction of the access magistrate was planned for the business area of Borské pole.
Later, he exchanged it very cheaply with the Magistrate towards a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the plots far.
The town hall had to give a heavy heart at that time, in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the plots.
Households' housing costs rise by a few hundred months
From January onwards, households will not only have to count at higher costs for all types of energy, but also at higher water and wastewater charges and for district heating and some places rents will also grow.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more monthly from the wallet than before.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and sometimes also consume the district heat supplies.
Each year alone, housing costs several hundred crowns more.
The high-current prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaics.
Gas is only slightly more expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too, with a few hundred crowns, you can expect more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Larger places in particular are planning price increases.
For example, from January onwards, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more for district heating up to 50 crowns a month, more than 1000 crowns more per year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges should increase by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will lapse from January onwards.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rentals by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this increase in rents, the company wants to take legal interest.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children join Fernett and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernett, Rum and Vodka, an exceptionally good whisky that was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which the drunk teens in Czech have to be treated most frequently under fifteen.
No exception are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head doctor of the Children's Department at the Middle Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father succeeds in evading a bottle from the house bar, and if not, at least distance or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with Juice, so he doesn't smell so strong," the chief physician explains.
The speaker of Motol Eva Jurinová's Faculty Hospital gives him the right to do so.
"Most often it's about distance or space."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"It was also a case of Slibowitz, which you take home from home," Ms. Jurinová led.
According to Dr Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen years old drinkers in the hospitalization have long been no exception.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, which he has been working on since this year, he worked for ten years in the paediatric department of Motol Hospital, where the rescue cars delivered drunken pupils from close by distance.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at 12 years, when she was first delivered with 3.5 per million alcohol in the blood and in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't find it strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician wonders.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in the incitement of their own explosives is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence on children in the true sense of the word.
"Under alcoholism, a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood and this is not the case with these children."
Among those who drink alcohol repeatedly is usually a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chief Doctor Pelikán.
According to the spokesman of Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were assigned to the local child medicine department until mid-November.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalisation are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drank such a bottle of schnaps in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes there are three seasonal amplitudes to which is left a hundred percent: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for pleasure on the holidays."
"On Walpurgisnacht I have already experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to struggle with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The morning’s headache, which is caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-sucking infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikan admits, at least by adding the cost of treatment to the patient.
Because the transport with the life-saving car and the night in an emergency bed come well and gladly on a few dozen crowns.
"I used this to be an educational tool when I calculated the children directly at the visit, what costed their drunkenness and that it could happen that they had to work all the time to earn the money for one such fetish," added Dr Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance funds do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the necessary costs from parents to cure the drunk children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, have been flown to Seville City on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time that this guy's machines are in possession of a foreign army.
So far, they were only seen in maneuvers or airshows.
This concerns the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - Omnipol company - has taken over last week.
When she physically expands the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-sea fighter aircraft were, in turn, isolated from long-term aircraft and this without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort.
"The double-seater L-159T1 were exchanged in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-seat fighters, as the Ministry of Defence signed with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract for the conversion of four superfluous L-159 into two-seat version in May 2009.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to deploy the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract states clearly that the company EADS is the receiver of aircraft L-159 and that they are to be used to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore the matter of the customer in which he realises the matter," Pejšek pointed out.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of another aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was still approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure for the purchase, but spoke directly to EADS.
The Defence Office at that time argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased 72 machines, of which they only used 24 and the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, Casa's purchase of the aircraft is likely to have a legal after-sale.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice, because it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European invitation to tender and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three of Casa's aircraft, the last being to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
Longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are apparently at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone Testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as an easy test for the risk of prostate cancer and this, in particular, in men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as familial health stress, she added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men to sixty at least by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned already in prenatal age clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research revealed that the testosterone is precisely accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was fleetingly known to him, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are blocked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under snow on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walking roads is mostly stuck snow, the winter servants were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This is what Novinky.CZ said to the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (ÚAMK).
In km 91, a truck crashed, in km 93 two trucks came together, and in this accident there were injured.
A few cars are also located in the road pit.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two trucks have collided.
The riders should leave immediately behind Brno at kilometres 190 or drive through Brno and drive up at km 182 at the town of Kývalka.
There are, for example, miles of dams.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 and this is immediately at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns form, for example, in the Prosek district, also the street Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams travel with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Board meets.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow occurrences.
Problems exist, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be informed of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia can only be navigated with increased caution.
To Vyškov, three side roads are completely inseparable, in the surroundings of Brno there are snow occurrences and in the surrounding area of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three roads are still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too you will need to use snow milling for snow clearance.
When they get to walk again, you can't estimate it so far.
In the Hodonín region caution is advised in the area of white carpathians.
On the streets, which can only be scattered inert sprays for reasons of nature, lies a snow ceiling up to five centimeters thick, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of fresh snow fell, mostly in northern Bohemia - occasionally up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it ceases to be snowy.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops used for the first time in Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon known only to date under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the force relationship to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a safety level of only a few meters.
The special shots of 25 mm caliber, developed for this rifle and containing high-explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only in the impact on the target but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to exploit "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically assumes that he looks at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact viewing point, after which he corrects the increase angle, then he only needs to press down.
"Let's say, you've measured 543 m."
"When you press down, the gun launches and shoots the shot at distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are shifted
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its subsidiary to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
In July next year, 400 women and men will move their workplaces from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, there should still be 100 more jobs in the Group, which have so far been distributed across the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, as well as the large offices in Astro Park would be better suited to the staff's working methods.
Fujitsu had only been a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport was particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointments to the losers yesterday.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezenent Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" was once again won.
It's a "big place confession".
Fujitsu applied to the city that the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long void in such prominent places.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is shown to be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the town hall square and the neighbouring "Small Verticale" was one of the most controversial construction projects in the Kurstadt with the remaining buildings on the Marienbad square ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between the railway station and the town hall, which provided criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously used areas as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was purchased by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
In Tokyo, Fujitsu consumers are the third largest IT provider in the world.
He provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees are in Munich, though.
From Bad Homburg, the Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary enters Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped layout - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, among other things, has its headquarters.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks are becoming increasingly distressed.
The Amazon Internet service provider has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange allegedly stopped in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is becoming increasingly exposed in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's flags, is supposed to stop after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks out of Amazon Server."
"Free speech in the Free Land", the disclosure activists informed Twitter via short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, Amazon’s Internet company had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in publishing the secret diplomatic depecs in order to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
On Twitter Wikileaks explained to the step: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its servers through Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's employees had conducted research, the TV channel CNN reported on Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Affairs had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman then called on the platform to deny the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unruly and ruthless action is jeopardizing our national security and jeopardizing life around the globe," said a announcement by the partyless senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, the exact place is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to investigations in Sweden as intriguing his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristin Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after Julian Assange's murder."
Therefore, Assange feared for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore keep himself hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, a director of government named Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there was a shock exchange.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "stupid and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recent espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of a guy's opinion with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The American government is now fully examining the protection of its databases.
As Special Representative, Russell Travers, Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, announced the White House.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary by Wikileaks after the announcement of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government shares and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would want to ensure the security of dissidents and activists, they should be at risk through the Wikileaks release.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Eis University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice detectors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest chance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does this whole ice cream come from?
From the Gelatatio and the Gelataio.
The gelatier, in German a bit old-fashioned of the ice-skonditor, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The Gelataio picks up the ice cream from the cooling counter with a spatula, stretches it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice does not come by the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the own ice cream parlor.
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others just dare to smooth the ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a company consultant and wants to do something personal in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice shelf in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatins Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget in his training the cream heap of national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step towards manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano dips the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice cream varieties.
The teacher is immediately asked questions: Can one make ice cream only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one let one’s own experimental passion run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of time.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarmin flour from the guarbone.
Of course one can make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it will sink together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
Maestro Luciano differs for the taste in the ice between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn dozens of flavoured additives on you."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes with eggs to the yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fruit ice varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit purée - this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutritious if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream produces the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Eishing is a calculation task: If peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemoneis.
Luciano draws a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winders thus measure the barley in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to calculate.
To make ice doesn't require as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device help to auto-manufacture the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixing is simultaneously creamed and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation in spite of small breakdowns do not go away.
The Brazilian Gustavo plucks up and his fellow students from top to bottom with fruit purée, when the overdimensional stick mixer goes out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until such a thing happens."
On-board light controllers
The European Food Authority, EFSA, was underpinned by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This allegation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract with the Ilsi Lobbyist Association for years.
It is paid by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA testing rules for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The Efsa Regulations were worded in word with Ilsi's position papers and thus sought the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the Italian Parma Authority.
It has already been the second time that Testbiotech complains of a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking Efsa manager has recently been a member of the Swiss Agrarian Group without any conditions or transition period - and has thus changed the pages.
The Central German Radio (MDR) has also recently revealed humane links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency and EU Parliamentarians very sensitive.
However, the EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
It is stated in an opinion that all serious data are taken back, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality.
The experts who work for Efsa do not demand that they have no contact with the industry.
But you have to reveal them.
Kuiper undertakes his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, on the risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate.
In this regard, independent experts such as Thenn criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding attempt in animals and the response of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what makes, for example, genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which did not produce reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?" then asks Then accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck sees it that way.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at Zurich University of Technology.
In this area, as in the US, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who have not been linked to corporations.
For companies critical studies would usually not be published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also has some concerns, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood as Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators were turned and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands of people demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar laying down of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, most of the wing was in debris.
Broken into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He made sure of some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He swears, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled cigarette fever.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the cracks yet.
Stones have time.
So did Uli Gsell.
The trail of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought them all that went down at the crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be ground in gravel or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden box that was once a guardhouse.
He was told when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the rest of the North Wing from the breaker.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the crash.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be used again.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the average 80 kilos of quads, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also in the hope of being able to return him during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, häuslebauer.
They had come from all over, and had dragged away what was possible to carry in the trunk and in the trailer.
Stuttgart's stones of the incitement have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into boundaries of herb beet.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He rises in his off-road car, making a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
Jura studied and discontinued, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of Stones are stocked.
From all over Germany he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
Has been slowed down.
In the snow lie artificially mowed sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke", he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, is swarmed.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the path through the forest.
He shows on a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe train station.
And on and on.
"Beautiful Travertine."
==References====External links==* Official website
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, touff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were used to be hand-hooked and moved with simple bottles and ox carts, he becomes quite vengeful.
"It would be a disgrace if you were to scrape something like that."
He didn't become rich. He wasn't rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, as well as a sculptor, a carpenter, a glass blower and a gardener at the top of the forest.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the reseller.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to save.
Talent contest for high-potentials
There's government force at the buffet.
16 students insisted on salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they are expected to learn about the car of the future - and by the way, they will learn about Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going to the close battle and, like VW, are going to cooperate with the universities.
Their mission: The most talented graduates can recruit in the auditoriums as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities don't issue statements about the achievements of their students, one tries to delay and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car group turns around the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be called into question as employees."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
New is the fact that the students are so aggressively squandered.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Celle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a large crowd of applicants.
But they must be commended and, above all, highly skilled workers.
Above all, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Federation of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for the KPMG auditing and consulting company.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern cutting yacht, in which the participants need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can view KPMG files and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to join will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When the high potentials at the universities are cut and cut, the guns, according to Dykta, are getting bigger and bigger.
"We want to get out of the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing game was too little for us."
Talent hunter Dykta seems to be billing.
"We are still in contact with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some people are just before their graduation and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct booming on the campus, small and medium-sized companies also go to the Pirsch classically at trade fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa on the Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, HR manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problems of young people.
Currently, 35 jobs are posted on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy some pacific positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that we can do internships or write his diploma work."
Expensive promotions are not sought by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to advertise with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"A large group often cannot offer this," says personnel manager Stübe.
Money has long since stopped playing the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good access are other crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld took 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe also expects positive points from the placement with the job seekers.
"I think applicants look at external assessments of a potential employer in particular," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employee Branding Academy advises companies who want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to become more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, mainly internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through his own employees," he says.
In the jargon sector, the internal employee is called branding, i.e. employer branding within one's own workforce.
Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat his people well and identify them with the company, then they would only be recruiting friends and acquaintances for their employer.
"This is like a game with bands," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years, off the coast of the United States of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A corresponding ban has been imposed on the Washington government - and thus its earlier plans are finally revoked.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains forbidden.
This was announced by Mr Ken Salazar, Minister of the Interior, on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should be applied at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the deepwater horizon drill platform in April.
Before the accident that cost eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico at the pressure of opposition and industry.
The proponents aim to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been finally clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which faces billions of demands.
A committee of inquiry on Obama's behalf is due to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop that had been imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been exposed to numerous corruption allegations, is fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced that it would close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that more stringent regulation would significantly reduce the amount of funding in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what exactly will change with regulation."
Investment in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like the gas station: billions of liters of waste oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't worry about it," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to illuminate a boy wading up to the breast in the water with the mud around him: In the rainbow-coloured water shine, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not to be seen that under surface brown raw oil swaths hover.
She used to pick shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the draining waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipeline poured raw oil into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now need to row six hours to get into fish-containing waters: The Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the world's worst devastated regions.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps of rivers, the entire extent of the destruction becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motorboat builds up brown broths, who dips his hand into the water pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black licorice rods from the ground, leaving sad palms to be found hanging their wings individually.
Bird swarms, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are sought in vain: As soon as the outboarder is silent, the former paradise, which smells like a gas station, spreads out spicy tranquility.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari doll: "We live in constant danger of health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield fought for decades: the first explorers from Europe invaded here more than 60 years ago, and in the 1980s with the later excavated writer Ken Saro-Wiwa organized the first resistance here, where the Shell Group had to stop its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still refusing to return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable the company is the location.
All pairs of hundred metres of steels are found as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" the heads of the drill holes are called much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion litres of oil have been transferred to the Delta's ecosystem, according to expert estimates in 50 years: year after year the amount of oil, as it penetrated the Alaskan sea 21 years ago at the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker's disaster - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the continuing Eco-GAU will argue about it.
During the shell group Sabotage and the organized oil theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leak pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner proposed to the 2008 Group: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like a deserted, oil-stained workshop under open air, emerges from the mangrove shapes: they are split-naked and lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels partly connected to pipes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes, later dripping at the end of the kerosene line and finally diesel out.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of diesel with just under 40 Euro cents per litre can still subsist the illegal cookers: because their raw material gets them free of charge.
It comes from "bunkers", who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts in the whole of Niger Delta, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day.
However, only a small part of the temporary intermediate raw material is illegally refined: the lion’s share fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and distorts it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is rather due to the population's revolutions or to the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari believes that it is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refining."
Meanwhile, the ratio of Ogoni to shell in particular was so destroyed that only a deduction from the Group would be questioned: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese appear to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Up to the time you're gone," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute, the soldiers can come."
If illegal oil refiners are caught by the Special Forces Unit, they may not be threatened with arrest, but they may have a painful lubrication.
The soldiers, like all Nigerians, who come mainly from the Nordic countries, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Detectors Detect Dangerous Building Errors in A380 Engines
The A380 obviously has a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible build error during the investigation of an emergency-landing machine that could lead to a "catastrophe engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much more fortunate than they have so far known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 engines - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an ATSB opinion published on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
The A380 engine was affected by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft.
This includes the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the UK turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint at an Australian Federal Court in Sydney that allowed him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said that his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the bearing surfaces damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the Superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all interested parties.
After the forced landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left approximately three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey flyer is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Landwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Over the night, snow fell almost all over the country.
Chaos, trains, and flights fall out on many roads.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic has snowed on Thursday at night - which often leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and in the east there are some 15 centimeters thick snow blankets.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly fresh snow.
In addition, heavy bows sweep over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) awaits on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning to storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal level.
In Saxony, the snowfalls on the motorways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the weather centre, the alarm level was set violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds made for disappearances.
Several trucks and cars stayed there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt too, police authorities reported major disruptions on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to increasing traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, shattered trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and bends are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firemen and rescue workers with woolen blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds sweep over the streets.
At large German airports the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokesperson of the Flight Information Center, some cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled according to a Fraport speaker.
Winter service is in constant use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
On many roads there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver came to life during a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Eastholstein.
The locomotive was easily injured.
Near Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: here, too, a truck was found on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver was killed.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when she had crossed over on smooth road with her car at Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have a good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore startle with light arches.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - local up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from her landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house buyers are looking for the two office towers at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to EUR 500 million could be invested in the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt bank district have been modernised; in the meantime, banks were allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes under appeal to a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution has already given up its registered office after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a domestic fund and then refurbished them extraordinarily.
The energy conversion combined the data according to around 200 million euros.
I think a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to industry experts, the value of the newspaper’s towers, now renamed Greentowers, is estimated to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of mourning for dead mates
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the shattered miners who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still the bodies could not be secured because the security situation in the accident bay is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were demolished under days.
A probe had been dropped into the disaster shaft, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend due to safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies could not be hidden so far.
Now, relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemoration.
Ten thousand people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island with a radiant sunshine in Greymouth.
They've been silent for two minutes.
In honor of the shattered miners, 29 tables were set up, on which there were helmets, lamps, and the names of the pals.
Images and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also took their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He cannot conclude with the death of his son as long as he did not see his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the Memorial celebration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also shattered.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were displaced, it will start to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Son of a bitch, warrior!
Does Splatter fit for the Kunstkino?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotteryes old genre borders with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman forces, changes his opponents in sequence - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies are already tearing the silence out of the living body when he has bad moods.
On the other hand, as he is actually called, Eineye says all of the film over no word, and also the other characters can be torn up into at least one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise, it is suspended and swallowed up in the horridly beautiful hills of Scotland, which the Viking world offers the backdrop of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinematists with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Nice, if a film has several target groups, only if it excludes each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug deal trilogy "Pusher" but refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most of the art cinema friends should be deterred from the surrounding brain mass and the sounds.
The action fans die at the latest from boredom when, for free-to-interpretable reasons, a mob of violent Christian missionaries breaks up via ship to Jerusalem and traps eternity in flute and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-squeaking façade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or a strict act, it's all the atmosphere, a film-made fever room.
And there is no escape from it for the audience.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and tangles his throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that beats him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little pale boy, who stands loyally side by side, preserves himself such a thing as innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Mostly, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly a messenger of the devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Enigmatic Earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this - nor does it allow control.
At least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria against midnight 5 on September 6, 2007.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has allegedly built in the quad with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that goes off the current.
According to a briefing of the CIA's foreign intelligence service at the end of April 2008, he would have been well suited to produce plutonium under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unspoiled satellite images.
By computer animation she faded in where which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atomic Center.
She also presented photographs showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had been present shortly before commissioning, it was called, but it had not yet been equipped with incinerators.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly more known than at that time, yes, the riddles got bigger with time.
The former U.S. president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw any indication that there was "an active nuclear programme" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "probable reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar in the summer, which IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The Syrians, however, quickly set aside the fire of the alleged "unused military building" and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team was found under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of Uranium, which had been produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which should be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA, via a Member State.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed never to run a secret nuclear program or have built a reactor.
The Uranium stems from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
However, this was unlikely by the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it refuses the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel, too, is silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently, the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is in charge of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the Falls has been slowing down since June 2008 and "increasingly develops into a serious credibility problem for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat has agreed at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - finally there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Locking Agreement in the area over which the IAEA is awaiting.
As a key to progress in information, the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions that are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and unlike this one still exist.
Until now, inspectors have not disclosed which facilities are, or what function they have or what they might appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung (Süddeutsche Zeitung), they are referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IAEA.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these sites and has located a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspect objects.
It may be in or directly adjacent to a military base - precisely because of this, Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to spy out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectors had become aware of the facilities through a tip of US intelligence.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the square on the Euphrates material was transported.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be cut off for the bomb, there are at least plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces were stored in three places.
As if hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shovel has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has investigated in 1998 as a storage facility for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought her into contact with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for Jane's prestigious magazine Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria was doing earthworks in the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to dispel suspicion.
In addition, it says in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows the great interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna worried a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, therefore the thing has not been very urgent, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the strongest means the Viennese nuclear authority has had to enforce controls.
Although IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken about "an option for which I am open in the future", he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and on the other hand, some of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than an attempt to escalate.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
The script itself wrote it, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for rest.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, persists in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian Women's Associations have immediately protested, and some of the film days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot off in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about UNHCR refugee aid to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is himself an ambassador of the UN refugee aid.
Diplomatic is not she - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they rejected it.
Hasecic said that the meeting had to take place in Bosnia.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Joel's attitude to the victims told her enough about the screenplay.
According to her organization, according to UN refugee aid, she recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, says the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who got to read her script, issued a film license for Sarajevo after a few years - it's not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author himself charges that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked with a lot of effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague in content.
This is how a second synopsis is taught about the film on the web, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew themselves before the outbreak of war and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, were dragged into a Serbian camp in which he worked as a guard.
What sounds quite different than the variant "A rape victim is banging into torture.
That Joel's film actually begins before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on her, said Jolie, was "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only get the hackers of Hollywood peace: By setting up the screenplay, as many had done before, illegally.
Nothing like this.
This evening it will finally run around for the Irish again.
No sign of trouble.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheer for joy with loud music, they stamp with their feet.

"I have a mummy feeling," he says.
"It's so far from home and yet I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerked, tock her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: Like the tanners it looks like on the island in many families.
It is likely that 100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, say experts from the ESRI economic and social research institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, a wave of emigration is comparable to that in which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of the upswing, which brought with it great prosperity for the Irish, it is now beginning to expand again.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain about the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has only gone uphill so far.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are a lot of readers' letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."

The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are just raising a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
His home now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as never."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well maintained courtyards, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 percent of the money.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the loan might go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I have no children that I have to feed through and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like the wailing that he hears often at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Work abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel crazy."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Open the future and just watch how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he's already behind him, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that concerns him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could end up in a life-giving party.
"Not only too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"Congratulations, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a day away, pretty easy, with some friends, some drinks, some games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a major problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarometro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist, came to this conclusion.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the exchange of views in this region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the Pacific coast of South America, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy supporters rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse of last year, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, reducing the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44% of the respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. These are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This was also the case during the world economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America only experienced a short recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(In 2009 reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the poverty rate in Latin America rose slightly and fell again by 32%.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see Graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes increased, this is less so.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many people in Latin America have seen a major problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Graph 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been the victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economy: around 71% of respondents over-regionally indicated that the private sector is indispensable for development; in 2007 it was 56% (see Graph 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress with its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, states many private companies.
Brazil has, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year) the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, the respondents in Mexico and most of Central America see the most influential country in the United States, with this role being taken over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
An option button
Nobody expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28th.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the electorate who were trying to help the affected country.
Overcrowded polls, multiple votes, ballots in the cinnamon, demolished pollings and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Election venues opened with hour delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, wandered around looking for an option.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, demanded that the election results be abolished because of alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "a pretty good choice in many interests".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly obliged to the unpopular President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected pick-up is planned for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martyly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial indemnity charges.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no consent to the electorate, explains that the electorate is the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On the election day many Haitians were hindered by lack of organization in the vote.
Approximately 250,000 certificates were not yet distributed for election shortly before the start of the election.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same opinion.
Secret in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points over 50%. That is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you are helping this to re-elect next year depends on whether the seemingly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also guided economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the pair of presidents to spend the extra revenue on their own account.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further scathing.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian struck another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own account.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, official inflation rates are 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, rather than the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which then looked forward to official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a moderate path now?
She called the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks.
And official statements suggest wage increases should be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have boosted the economy.
However, inflation undermined the pace of growth by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may wish to join Argentina financially again to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push for an agreement with the money donors from the Paris Club that she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a verification by the IMF, as elsewhere.
However, last month, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Mr Boudou, announced that the fund would provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index, as if this were the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after her term of office has ended.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, the majority of which has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was shown to her will be abducted.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly and quietly lift many of her husband's political decisions.
Poor applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a narrower connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters, were elected to vote in the five districts of mayors and city councils. This is considered to be a broad rating of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol for the relationship with mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with China's mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of his party's votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city streets together with the KMT.
During the election, there came to the events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with Krawallmachers, flag-hanging mass removals and only narrowly dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, spoke on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
when a man shot him from the crowd into the face. Lien was wounded and killed a nearby viewer.
Bizarre is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has given more votes.
China may have been the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoided exasperating the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, Ma wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support its China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of withdrawing Taiwan with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent an negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it also wishes political integration, but the most important thing first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was vehement for absolute independence.
But under Tais Regentschaft, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fought for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai found great support as a presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Their party now does everything to show that she too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to make an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes time-free discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas quick approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even asked the pragmatist Su to abandon the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's involvement, the DPP is finding it difficult to choose their potential candidates.
KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing division between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will reshape his cabinet and the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limited in favour of re-approaching.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony ceremony. Now, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was overwhelmingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in the jazz scene in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at least three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known in the general public.
Your ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can compare Spalding with Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success comes next as jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings.
In addition, the album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of critics thus experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a raw New Orleans favorite and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, where other albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the Wild Steampunk Musician Darcy James Argue was probably given due attention in the category of Big Group. He thus opposes the Billy Children Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octett, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead into the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughterty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, mountains were nominated "Lulu vom Orchester des Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," explained Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral presentation for a recording of the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianist Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Eectix and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to the Commission’s statement of Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic sight.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The session began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There's no more America," said one comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud called Harmoush for nonviolence.
His municipality with about 135 families lives peacefully for years in Riverside County. However, they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque will have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is to be created on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacteria species that can live among others from Arsen opens up new opportunities for new life forms on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is in their opinion a sign that a life is possible even without the elements considered necessary to date.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it very special, although it's almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
"That's when you ask yourself what else is possible," said the co-author of Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planetary systems can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital to life are not necessarily specified," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that one element can be replaced by another in basic biochemical processes and structures," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose Mono Lake because of the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to its chemical behaviour similar to that of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic looks different than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it almost lubricates everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based form of life can naturally occur either on earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there was no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early forms of life have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently from the early age of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and National Health.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as unknown to the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel at night, reported the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are good at it," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make precise information about the location of the dogs yet about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say it anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're tracking a few traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal home in Downey.
The sheriff's representatives found the delivery cars and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three - year - old male, and Didi, a ten - month - old bitch, were unharmed, according to the official statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to introduce this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard visited the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-throated Akitas and Corgis remained in the van because it was cooler there.
They left a gap open to the window, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised a finder's wage to anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage will be paid.
The lion roars again after the MGM restructuring has been approved.
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a new-Yorker bankruptcy judge launched the "preparation" gleeful plan to clear up the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to open the way for new films and television shows.
According to the statement of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spiglass Entertainment, will no longer stand in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the studio as the main manager.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually only enter into force when JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million planned bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of investment banks, which itself pays $75 million, directs the company. The financing is scheduled to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the corporate management, who fought with interest payments of $300 million per year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who was known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve the financial services of MGMs and to pay for the more than 140 slots of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company a purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything began from the beginning when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid monthly for the management of the company $375,000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio produced only one film and produced an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films for "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, the largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a considerable hole into their gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys with their own website appear, there is a wider offer on the most famous of these types, webkind and Club Penguin.
More and more button cells-driven toys come to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs that sing a note when you press your belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, you can play a song through multiple presses.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (fisher price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplay games like 'Simon says', and thanks to its new hinged feet with wheel-blocking, it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can be a car ride to a class hour, with a better knower with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which according to Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, lighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have its own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together to speak before the time runs out. It’s great for an improvised bookcase competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy shops only after the offer, Webkind and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
These can be roller boots or a puffy stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of monasteries.
And he's holding out a lot.
We fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checked his nervous subjects and gave orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their slope of violence - to impress the viewers.
"Stop right there!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely growing up in their teens, stood tight with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight line.
Four decent hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"For me, they look on average," said Mr. Tang, disparagingly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a brilliant blue uniform instead of the grey-green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by Niederstarren: According to reports in 2009, 50 officials saw an improperly positioned snack truck and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have reinforced the urban police patrols. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the poor picture that the Chinese have of these city councils.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone, as they put down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for the Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries following a handful of handcuffs with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," last year the China Daily national newspaper Lamented, after further controversy over tactics.
The paper called for a "real clean-up".
Skeptics are clearly inadequate to the present approach.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by display in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to a job advertisement, women between the ages of 18 and 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is physically too strenuous.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unannounced district official at Rednet.com's quasi-government website.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
"Women Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but they also have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City Administration, would not agree to this description,
However, it admitted that in China size standards in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is like good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dispositions do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or bucklings here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrolized on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cakes and a well shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexualistic that such great value is placed on her appearance.
"Find out, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with ironic gaze.
Your colleague, with the dikes, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their data, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply to scare traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the stripe deals with about twelve street traders who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes on foot or on a bicycle as possible before they are pursued.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already told you so often!" explained Ms. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his pasta kitchen stuck on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure distribution.
"Everything routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of dealers, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public attacks that officials in China are frequently exposed to.
This year hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, ransacked after the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officers were injured in the night, 14 government vehicles were thrown or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officials patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired instead of in a workshop contrary to the regulations on the sidewalk.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials went their way to their vehicles with an angry face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male strip coordinator, remained behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time people start the fight."
Prosecutor won't sue Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges brought against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying job, the prosecutors of the Senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious court case against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which took care of headlines throughout the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate for the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office reported, he was "rejoicing" about the judgment of the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary sentence.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were terminated and that no further charges were made in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has failed to comply with the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped to buy lucrative orders to raise his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during an election campaign of Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interrogations he took over for her after Hampton’s lobbying.
Since Hampton was in Ensign's election team recently, he was not allowed to take on lobby work for his former employer or the entire Senate for one year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friends with the Affaire, was violated against the so-called prohibition of turning door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be all about an agreement and the violation of the rotational door statistics," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the direction of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethiopians said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for the misconduct of the prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in the parliamentary and governmental circles of the United States), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to trial.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview he had received a phone call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another one the next day when he was told that the ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenseman had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to terminate investigations for a separate appeal by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents had violated the Hamptons against the Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money had been anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found help from Mr. Ensign Lobbyist's work.
An e-mail of December 2008 shows that after the company had continued to lobby Mr. Hampton, Mr. Ensings Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was "closing" at the Ministry of the Interior because of a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had stopped Mr. Hampton for lobby work.
When last year, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been ranked fourth in the Republican ranks.
After he hadn't noticed in many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of police investigation, his press spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and set up its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's appointment makes Twitter pay attention
Half a dozen of them tipped off in the Krawalls in the courtroom.
In minutes, they sent their reports about cruel testimony on Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
However, Mr. Hayes' attorneys have already filed applications to court, explaining the reasons for an appeal and employing the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that due to the intensive reporting on the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has come to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of intrusive details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public disarmament.
This objection could prompt the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it is a real danger if the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's Chief Defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, dismissed the applications by decision last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there would be no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court orders have found that reporting on famous-infamous cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a process.
In its historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say, court cases which Mr. Hayes' convictions consider half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the lines of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of the Falls Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be alarmed by the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she is arbitrarily hanged.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who portray Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudiced already when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime pictures during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, they would have filled with horror.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge wrongly exchanged a jury who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office and that he had put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest to them.
In a verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continually rekindled the flames of emotions over the case.
"A day-to-day rush by the media pips, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were more outrageous than reports that are being reported more slowly was a technico-optimal view that was slowing down reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In her objection, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on account of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the end of the separation?
After a campaign of chimp words and negativity this week little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of a genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the battle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the summit's tops did not bring any breakthrough on the big issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called 'lame duck session', the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were taken.
According to all that one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a observance of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party score.
The President's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that conceals the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
That is hardly enough to claim that there has been a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-war.
Therefore, the meeting itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or expectations, both sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, Washington's November election voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse party passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "Lame Duck Session", Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports this.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it's temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise with regard to increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, although only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax cuts for the rich, while refusing to provide support to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the new START contract.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insituation warns that successful cooperation on urgent questions of the lame Duck session" does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps indispensable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from today to 2012, as a forefighting, or shadowboxing, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this are very much linked to the emergence of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party electors who were involved in its formation.
As concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are too high poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises, reduce government spending and put health reform out of control.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the Commission's recommendations on deficits, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, the raising of the retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
Vice-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erstine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own opinion, have so much pressure to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan official and they fight very hard to get even close to this figure.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges with regard to the state budget, taxes and health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the party nature of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it has happened in 1995, then both parties must pay attention to the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress-Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides, much more effort will be required to find a common denominator in the questions that the two still separate from each other.
Swift US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "cleptocracy" and it passes on to the Kremlin part of the bribery and protection payment she collects. Thus, in February, the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security services are extorting high levels of protection so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every piece of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical authority" - takes its share of the money that the leaders are moving up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington by Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on his homepage by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Lushkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime had been cleared up.
Lushkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous slanderous charges against such accusations.
In September he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentation suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in polls.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is not heard that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow Government with crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to conclude that the government acts more like a cleptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of the criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Specialists have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is in the top position."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Last time, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the bottom of the line."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues to say that FSB funds are collected from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
A source, so called, is "explained that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer required as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself very modest are none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed before - due to one or another pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, it is estimated, by the way, that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranked in 154 a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (the least corrupt countries are listed as "most corrupt").
The disclosure of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although, as Lushkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that one can solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and angryly responded to the disclosure that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concreted classroom with dirty and daring walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capitulation to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to face the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June the government distributed a school book that tells the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time children of former soldiers.
And in July, for the first time, a former member of Khmer Rouge was sentenced to 35 years in prison to the former head of the notorious Tuol Slang Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is still opposition and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her life under Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision, or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the regime's remnant and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the murky poverty of the rural Cambodian and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite officials of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
At 55 years of age, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, the jungle fought for Veng before settling in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Oneg Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to trial.
The court's mission is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the crimes, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have concentrated on In Chaem, 64 years, who had been the district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s.
In 2007 she told the documentary center of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang thma damm, a project in which thousands of forced laborers probably died.
On a hot evening, In Chaem came back from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast shadows on the weary grass, Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court invited her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer Times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that they can understand like everything."
The Centre created the first school book on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia", approved by the government.
The book was distributed in Along Veng in June as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are judged by the courts."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, an overgrown road led by shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black red, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cellist on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting-place, where she'll lay down a bush of ripe bananas - hoping he'll bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to further collect capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that uranium will no longer be collected, which is a critical element of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarus's Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years the US government had tried to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But the U.S. government officially told Washington Post that over the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been concluded to remove 187 pounds of weapons-enabled uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 nations" of April, which the Belarus had ruled out.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basic weapons capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We're not gonna make dirty bombs out of it and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the Uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, say official.
It was loaded into a special train for which more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say official.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by plane.
The US government pays for these efforts $14 million, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust", which led to the convention signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-free uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012 under the common agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcomed to the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as indicated by a telegram of the ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This reflects the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable) and added that the former deputy head of government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, called on the Spanish government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid for human rights-repudiation practices was charged in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "had "received Zapatero" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed," in order not to be "unpreparedly surprised", Aguirre reports via cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as it was in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González gave the message to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any troubling or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "appearable coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to operate discreetly between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba attended, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were madly concerned about their independence and did what they thought was appropriate," he had given instructions to his employees "to avoid blowing up rhetorical comments in order to let the tension fade away."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a point of view that the government of Zapatero, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will have tolerated or deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States," he stressed.
The child murderer confessed that she complained about the "trouble" of motherhood on the Internet.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician Way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she carries on from a small age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications date from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know your love life that reconstructs ABC’s daily newspaper on the basis of testimony from their family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Tuuñez, an industrialist.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never had him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring congregation.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to take care of herself in the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him this, he found it good, but now he realizes, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and to let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May she says of returning to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until 19th because I have to introduce myself to work on 20th if I don't want to lose them."
She says she'll take her firstborn when she's okay.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother", a questionable intention, if you consider their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was supposedly murdered on the 10th day is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not satisfied."
"On the one hand he is with me and the place likes him a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less spending for the nanny."
On 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he'll find me, so shit."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la mada (Heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a dedicated hunting overseer, explains to have a bite of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred to Palma Province Prison yesterday by the Center for Prisoners at Menorca.
The defenseman, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not recall the course of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Previously, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
Defence and prosecutors applied for a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in the votes and MPs in the last regional elections, PP is already focusing its attention on the parliamentary elections - preferring or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the Catalonia elections.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316.222.
On the last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the diversion of the votes of the PSC and the binding of the electorate of the PP - were to stop, the analysts of the PP predicted that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress members, while CIU four (now 10) would win and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - at present it has three - while ICV could hold its MP or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date will be the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scales to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the biggest budget administrations: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will be able to lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists will not achieve a majority or use their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican Debacle, it is not wrong that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, in which it would have to win 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's turn. There they had ruled with PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Uncle Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to grow significantly.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell brought Al Qaida thousands of travel passes
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand.
The seven police officers of the Barcelona secret service, both Pakistani and Nigerian, formed the controlled jihadist cell from Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Motion for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was author of the attack in Bombay, which in 2008 demanded 106 deaths - supplied passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which go so far as to assure that with the "operation Kampai" the counterfeiting machine of Al Qaida has been "weaked" worldwide and "somit their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could without penalty cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. That is why other European police units have been involved in the investigation besides the Thai investigative bodies. It cannot be excluded that in the EU area in the next few days similar attacks will be carried out in Barcelona on Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiad were arrested) another one was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistan's Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai country Sirikanlaya Kiebumung was arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it was destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole tourist passports according to the specifications of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In investigation circles, it is underlined that until now no links could be established between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author was this assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of travel passes stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, a money transfer company had sent several thousand dollars, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the life of 106 people.
The police confiscated extensive documentation.
PP requests Mas to terminate the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present his conditions to support his entry as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already put forward during the election campaign and can be summarized with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party addressed Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members who won her last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to make himself felt indispensable. For the candidate of the CIU bourgeois-regionalist party has to say that at least one of the opposition parties is in favour of voting on his entry into office.
The future alliances that regionalists want to join in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible duck with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As regards the party chairmen of the PPC, it calls for "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region, similar to that in the Basque Country, and which the CIU's Head of Party even intends to submit to a referendum to the back.
Both political leaders mean that they want to make the established political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the accession of Mas concern itself from the side of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Altenpflegeheim confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not rule out that their nurse killed over 11 elderly people
The leaders of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they discovered the damage to the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - to the institution.
The head of the Old Care Centre, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the right and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social loss because it had not determined the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has been murdering ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point round and said that "the absence of measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there would be no evidence in the lawsuit of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
He was baptized as "Death Angel" yesterday at eleven murders and declared that he had committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first one in which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat said that access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail were used by the caregiver in six out of nine crimes committed in order to relieve patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will reveal whether Vila is lying and for his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he burned it out from the inside by handing them bleach, as he had done in confession to three women whom he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat one does not give faith to the statements of the caregiver, not even as to the number of committed murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it does not make sense to change his course suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents by the judiciary.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors yesterday responded sharply to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our response capacity."
The risk-absorptions of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be deceived and that the euro has left little room for concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, but due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as they were ineffective, as well as for the abolition of any exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It was only to maintain a one-week unlimited access.
According to the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "by March at least" and the quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to buy bonds and produce a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets is discarded yesterday and if we insist that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank reaffirmed its failure to consider the purchase of sovereign debt and thereby collapse the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot, with which she provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year’s state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
Government asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, Portugal's interest rates fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change of perception of the markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, allied and Bank of Ireland’s debt hole figures were published.
The sum is estimated to be approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000 in the short term.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had not recognised the problem of the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel designed her discourse with regard to the summits of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish Prime Minister yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions, such as financial institutions, the reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures sounding in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our re-indebtedness.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a sacrifice of its own.
We would have liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now it is not only being, but also appearance."
Only courage, we can do that!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of Eulen is attached to the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not drift away.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate group, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on 16th, as he considers it "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority in order to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new Judicial Chapter in their dispute to control a part of the Group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem to be prepared to give up the control of the organs of El Enebro in his litigation.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting of 18 January of this year, which has already been registered in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the lap of the Álvarez family.
The appointment of the judge to convene the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of applicants - his five children - in order to allow, by means of legal delinquency, fraudulent practices and abuse of the rights, to recognise the declaration of the assembly of 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for challenge to the Assembly in retrospect in order to declare it "absolutely void".
In June, the same protagonists, in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting on a judicial basis.
With El Enebro - asset company and owners of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, alongside other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for the right to use more than 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the handling of the appeal for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history in this exquisite universe has been marked by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, everyone sat at the end of November on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, this is a powerful software for simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer science program, known as PLM, was used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and highly precise instruments.
A true reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid faults and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industry department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the race and during the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the race stations, which could bring in no more than three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in the Red Bulls team. With high-performance computer systems, they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the security elements are being changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend in a season for its race.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a 50-kilometre location in London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially of journalists - are severely restricted.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drinking manufacturer places in the services of his participation on the racing routes are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose familiarity is zero.
The technology manager of the plant, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, it could be said that the progress made in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while pilots' contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "unforeseeable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a sales network of 80 to 100 square meters each consisting of twenty shops, which the Multi intends to open in Spain for the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned the rebuilt shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working together for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mr. Herrera did not want to betray the forthcoming openings, but did not rule out Madrid being the next target.
The deputy chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that philosophy for the opening of stores is always the same. She is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive sales office network was intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises at the time of purchase and then, yes, even the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service connects to the Maastricht Technical Centre (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rival in three years a million customers 'clave'
The managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates that banks are trying to compensate for with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - an existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to survive the next three years, and thus in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year roadmap in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you cut off the customers that will lose the bank - which is the big challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year, it has attracted 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers represent more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, say austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual financial statements.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has upset all the banks' plans worldwide.
Sabadell will conclude its Optima guideline this year, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers that will leave the savings banks are the bank's main goal.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola emphasized, 2011 would be a "hard" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only be "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the bank's survival.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalises interest margins - will slow down, the risk supplements that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will be taken into account when compensation for falling profit margins is already down to the credit price.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the arrangement to its branch network on Thursday, limiting the granting of long-term loans and increasing the interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing state policy, "to increase fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not for nothing, he assures us that "larger companies are necessary in Spain."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "equal" and did not rule out the fact that some Spanish financial institutions will be torn down in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market with captita loopstocks.
After ensuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary closing of markets, he reinforces the argument of some banks who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be circulated, but unlike the events in June, short-term repo financing could be obtained and thus the crisis could be intercepted.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a fusion wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be considered a second round, but it was about adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven times, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers Aragoniens (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely course, which was set in earlier times, not now, within the framework of business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 per 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "There would be a series of undisclosed opinions about the slowness of the process, the indistinctness and insensibility," because "Banco de España urges us to close in due time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "maybe" in the whole world and added that those who did this "without any deeper knowledge" were doing so.
The manager noted that in the current economic cycle, we need to "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" concentration process, which will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the entire European Union.
Market tensions have triggered a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the lifting of the 426 Euro support for unemployed persons who do not receive unemployment benefits, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person who had expounded the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It was foreseen that Merkel's position was not a public error.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners.
In the face of resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it currently sounds rather like science fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is a reorganization of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that comply with the requirements; possibly the cancellation of payments by some countries; and the extension of the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been outstanding for some time now. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew from its own constitutional reform in order to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of disintegration between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country, as Merkel painfully postponed the decision to rescue Greece.
This was strongly criticised at that time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, during the last days of October, Merkel has again come out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be saved while at the same time requiring private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since it has led to the Irish crisis and all the following.
But its proposal, albeit somewhat sweet, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It says to everyone that - even if unpopular measures have to be taken now - there will be no longer the old functioning of the euro from that date.
In 2013, the year of birth will be a new currency area in which the countries in conflict will be severely penalised can be forced to declare themselves insolvent and in this case the private sector will have to assume part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, measuring consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad not to understand.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence goes into more rest.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that will be offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis of creating order in their own house has prepared their way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything would change.
Under the possibilities considered, we would not have to leave the euro area filled with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulatory environment
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to bypass a penalty.
It was alleged that two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) had an exclusion in the November 23 game against the Ajax in the Champions League, leading to a lot of ink being shed on whether or not it was an unportraitable act and whether or not both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before players (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will comply with the prescribed penalty at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice; it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate on the presented case is due to the fact that a team of the real Madrid football club (who presented noble courage and honor in his hymn and had punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role in this, and to the dramatisation by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether these practices, which are not expressly prohibited by the Statutes, contradict the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a circumvention of rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to bypass its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the attacking players taking unfair advantage of the counter-team. Also, that did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by misplay or rule bypass, because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out secretly to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was not placed in a more unfavourable position or that benefits were gained for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, up to a certain degree of unknowing advantage, as the team could eventually also leave. In addition, the players receive a penalty with this procedure and move into the second card cycle, in which they leave with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is therefore not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
In the end, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to derive maximum benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (it would actually be a clear case of regulatory circumvention), they wanted to choose when to submit to them.
They made a strategic decision without evading a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between the invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventive step.
I have the impression that the polemics were created as a result of two factors: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer opening to the customer's meeting for group Christmas Eve dinner in Barcelona
The journal of the calendar allows an avalanche of reservations to fall on the days 16 and 17 December this year.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread out. They don’t want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there is also a group dinner in the pre-Christmas season that brings oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry in Barcelona. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they are opening a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the great mass: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the companies and associations in question.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinners to two top owners (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when bad times began, many companies have closed the group dinner for household reasons.
To avoid this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pockets.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are required, the chairman of the Barcelona Restaurantgremium, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the Roof Association does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think it over ten times before they reserve."
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he stressed.
The business will go well with those who "offer the quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls us into the memory that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of December 17th the suppliers lead to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that demand for this Friday would be booming with the intention of spending less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which directs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the second quarter of the year when revenue has flourished again and good, though even on a few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business.
Sources of the business group stress that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than prishit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
There are also green sprouts in some companies, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back on the rise again.
On the sides of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the club, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are generally quite "vigorous", even though the customers "beat out a maximum".
The fun at the celebration, however, did not go down, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the USA
Islamabad manufactures nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileak's revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department revealed by Wikileaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concerns of Pakistan's Washington nuclear program.
On the edge of the clarifying and judicious details which the documents offer on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but, on the contrary, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
In particular, the very nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but that their individual parts are stored to make their destruction difficult - Washington prepares sleepless nights in a possible attack.
In a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, mentions: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-attacked area, the probable dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear and rocket programs is no longer considered by the United States alone, but also by Russia to be far-reaching and responsible for taking care of.
"Pakistan needs to employ strictly religious personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low educational and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit those involved in nuclear or rocket programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that the cooperation between the US and Pakistan is leaving in nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" states: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers on help offers or they are rejected."
In another announcement, Peter Lavoy, State Intelligence Officer for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "explain to the responsible" that "Pakistan's army has to cease its tacit over-support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking officer for the anti-terrorism campaign to prevent new revelations.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for Assange's "invention and persecution."
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of Wikileaks' founder Mark Stephens assures us, "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
As early as 20th, the international police department based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not notified by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after obtaining the authority.
So there are things. The 188 Interpol countries are forced to identify Assange and find out "to temporarily arrest him and deliver him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to persist.
Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities at video conference, were dissuaded.
They also recall that Assange applied for departure from Sweden and was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, who was granted the corresponding approval.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is appreciating her son’s innocence - Assange stops in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday he gave an interview to the head of the magazine Time per Skype from an indefinite place. During the conversation he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the appointment of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the Press Secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "stupid and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value a guy's opinion with a website," he explained to CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high leader in the anti-terrorism campaign, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt of President Barack Obama to give less attention to Assange is contrary to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chairing the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies from January onwards, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of adding Wikileaks to the list of terrorist organisations, "to confiscate their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target disk and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that sent information in the government, he's guilty of betrayal, and all that's not an execution is too mild a punishment," he told the station Fox.
Puigcercós is looking with a blindfold to the Carod Middle Peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general meeting principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the ranks for the twentieth time of an internal uprising after the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the voters' votes.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. However, he also knows that the influence of this sector today has weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause the same breakdown of head as other previous currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a blind eye, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
At the beginning yesterday, the more than 200 regional councillors of ERC could secretly express their views on their stay in office.
With ballots, not with a high hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss the president's sentence, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added "in Bulgarian style" without indicating the percentages, a result would not be good either.
The Carods ask the President more than just the party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Executive Board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to take part in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, that the management will be able to vote on 18th to the Council.
Their intention is to protect Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to present the Congress in autumn 2011, which the party leader already believes to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the Executive Board, so that these at least 90 percent of the party members represent, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the general meeting principle as a function.
He thus advocates a reform of the Statutes, which should allow Congresses to hold with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, the party leadership was instructed at the meeting of 2008 to review the general meeting principle at a conference to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still due to the fact that the internal turmoil of the last few years has not been the cause of this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying on top of it, the time could have come to re-take up this matter and close it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO, four cases were recorded in México less than 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to the accounts of MILENIO México, which are four less than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the find of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, we come to a total of 390 deaths, probably related to organized crime.
In the case of San Diego de los Postale Cuexcontitlán, a place in Toluca, is highlighted.
The subject had at least three shots of firearms, the grace shot was given to his head and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a car parked on the road Mixtecas in the village of Santa Cruz Acatlán in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, farm workers found a body with torture tracks and at least three fatal shots in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
In addition to the body, a message was probably signed by the critical organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots after leaving his house to do his work as a garbageman.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds ended up in the village of Ecatepec in San Pedro Xaloxtoc as a result of shots in the head.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with the shot of grace in the forehead was found on a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a cartridge case shot down with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the waste water canal of the village of Playa Golondrina.
The emergency service was looking for the rest of the body parts, but it did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported on the discovery of a body they had discovered in the Peña Colorado area. The hands were bound back together and the head was tied.
The man had a wound that came from the shot of a firearm in his neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were killed, encased in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle abandoned on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two threats of murder were found.
One day later a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th day two dead women in the Zoquiapan settlement of Ixtapaluca were discovered and the next morning in Huixquilucan were found the body wrapped in a yellow-blue ceiling of a man who, according to the news left behind by his murderers, probably named Mario Ríos.
In the village of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in the neck.
On the woman's skin tattoos were discovered by Santa Muerte and chains with corresponding illustrations.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three contributions and a message signed by a criminal group were found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies were discovered by two men whose heads were covered with adhesive tape, and a message was discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The opposite of the body was probably a message signed by a criminal organization, which said: "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet were found with torture marks inside a taxi located behind the centre of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies were discovered by two men in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one had been purchased in the village of Cuchilla Ancón and tied in black plastic bags, and there was a message. The second one had been tortured and found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a father with a message.
China maintains its GHG reduction targets
China's representative stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China's offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16) Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and to change its industry.
He explained that over the last four years, his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He stated that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the goals of saving energy, efficient use of energy and reducing emissions.
In addition, he explained that a number of multi-annual plans have already been initiated or concluded, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those received from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy introduced over the past five years and received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private.
There is also a project on climate change at provincial level, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy savings and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser to climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than would be generally accepted.
He showed that greenhouse gas emissions per capita in China accounted for six tons per person, while in the United States it was 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years and is expected to be further achieved by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist party chairman had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that Espinos' exclusion was a decision that had been made at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"The (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a premise for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "doesn't frighten us the internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman or chairman, the Acción Nacional, for the next three years. Therefore, he handed over the staff "to those who would determine the Council."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to delegate to each of the five the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the party's recent election of July 4 will be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would bear their flag and be observed throughout the country. That is why "many hopes and desires are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When he was asked about the PRI's criticism on the President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's followers to think about the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government expresses such expressions as those he could make in his discourse in Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral prohibition and even less censorship.
Obama uses Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are in favour of adopting the Dream Act law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - the law on the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His short notice contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to come into contact with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 republican senators threatened to block all vote for each law, except for the extension of tax reductions from Bush's times and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republicans, could have the effect of voting the Dream Act - law and other projects such as ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Commenting on the blockade of Republicans under the law Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax theme was resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be handled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement about this at any time and then we can plan the outcome of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request a vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - the law with which the initiative to legalise undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - the law or the law of the American dream would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while the last five years have lived in that country and have been enrolled in a higher education institution or army.
But the law's advocates need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side, if other Democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
The most republishing republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The desire for the language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story.
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (on another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "will bring us into trouble", the Argentinean writer spoke sweetly to the audience, who mainly consisted of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this moderated round table by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she devoted to Gonzalo Celorio, and later identified the shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who is looking for to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she gets no answer, but clues to the guide of her story.
The infectious scientists leave her convincedly: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who robbed you of the breath in the middle of the corridor, and who explain to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst removes the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs and concludes that "it was only learned from the wound that it was really open and did not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for the language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling narrative, which he called 'the invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With references to magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back well-traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turnaround and reported on by America, the great novel, which from the beginning it was not lacking in its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even the sense of shame came to pass."
However, he points out, "it is the crazies and liars who are the best imagining things," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side is the story, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Traditional Cervantes'.
"From him we inherited to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the FIL had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican women devoted their contribution to the great wounds of social violence that their country is in love with - like all Latin America - as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unplanned commitment," she explained after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, Spanish poet Luis García Montero decided, whose contribution was also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world the intellectual habits and control of consciousness are also running out on dogmatisms, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation is a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuances often mean putting the finger into the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in playoffs, he has experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are also two different styles opposite their respective trainers, and their encounter, characterized by opposites, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in playoffs, he has experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played with the medal to the second champion, he has remained one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive final games with the same team.
The S.A.S. Strategy was the first to finish the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when Del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to strike again, as the game went out with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at 11 meters he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to record his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his big rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," said the tax collector when they asked him about the lost games.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures us to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared with two eleven meters, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game has not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by eleven-meter shootings, he does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the eleven-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, fate brought us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce striving to hold the title in your hands, which left us something behind for this final game, and we hope it won't come this time."
It is in Romanso power not to be just second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
The US amends the rules for obtaining a visa
Before talking to the Consulate, the persons must present themselves at the services for visa applications, which will reduce the cost of waiting times.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will be changed in the United States Embassy and Consulates.
For the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves before their conversation in the consulate at the visa application service points (ASC, initial letters in English).
The ASC staff shall record the applicant's biometric data, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of the processing of the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the term agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the countervalue to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with request (including visas for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only wish to extend their visas do not need to conduct a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the service charge of 26 dollars.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for aliens in space.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 a.m. at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. This is a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured them that it would "present a prudent find for the search for extraterrestrial life", which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments that were previously considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was thrown out that they could turn into intelligent living beings – such as humans – if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found on the basis of Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was thought too toxic for all possible life forms, since the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbe uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances increase that there may be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it has been proven that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its findings at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference is attended by the geobiologists Pamela Conrad, who explores the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) on whether his chemical composition is similar to the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system was introduced, they complained.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and already an opposition block was installed, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined themselves as an independent. The four questioned the following: the introduction of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the introductory session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo weathered the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded from it.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled the congress.
These four delegates, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, chaired by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in its capacity as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political marginalisation with these reforms.
He stated that in the next few days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. They went out of their political will, and if they did not have it, they would again be unjustly wronged by both parties, with which the opposition coalition would end.
"Up to this I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions, who do not even take into consideration the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that, after being monopolistic, the congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that Congress should have an eternal two-party system."
"For the start, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, in an illustration to PAN and PRI, stated that the congress had now turned into a 'fetter' for two.
"Previously it was just a party, now they split it up into two."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the MPs and to assign them their place to the negotiating tables.
"Five people who are likely to be nine Members should not be left outside because the five who are currently seen as being divided up into different groups have decided to join forces to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check over just over 200 000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued on an amount of 200,144,56 peso was issued with the number 9258447 last 16 November with the purpose of "billing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already announced that more money would go from the community to these suppliers. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still to be owed to her and, consequently, the number of cheques still to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the suppliers have not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is challenged by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste had published on July 25 the audit of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced that from March 2008 until July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of the mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid more than 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
Shops with Jumapam were also held where they entered cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested special attention from the authorities, the areas that are in bad condition and throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada dealership, recalled that on different occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and transform the bad conditions that tourists find, into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and pedestrian paths would have had a negative effect, as the tourists would come to slop and see the disorder, and then they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction in this way slowly and without planning."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist would have brought to the attention of the missing prevention and maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must assume its responsibilities and avoid this happening again. How it should do that? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in retrospect," he said.
"We are looking forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, but also we residents have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy in order to maintain the city in a good state."
"There are other places that also look unkept and unfinished," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents simply state what is obvious to all: Maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Sub-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist sites of Mazatlán, because they would not be properly used and had a bad image created.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the forefront together with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Unfortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would have to be cleaned up and cleaned in order to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP Requests Congress Results
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a worthy parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces great problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the Congress of States are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and the different social groups, who depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not repeat the same patterns of partyism and patriotism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneur Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on great responsibility as an example of a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right to act freely between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with whom they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival-comparses of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should prove their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and work for society and its groups, above all, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the final elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, says that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today's economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is to encourage economic growth, investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the necessary importance to the State budget to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second-less resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been re-established in previous legislative periods, must be brought up to date.
Holy King Seeked
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family longing.
For the parents it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next day of the king, because the household is no longer composed of twelve people and a goatbow.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the village of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have a firm job.
"Sometimes hard times are wanted because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the doers to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wishes for a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus suggests Cayetana clothes in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster so much', but I answered him, 'let us wait, boy', because it was very expensive', Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has size 12 and the ten-year-old Isaías size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel size 8 has size.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. Couples of size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realise the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 Suspect Drug Dealer Arrested
On Wednesday, around ten house searches were carried out in the management region of Estrie in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where places that were supposed to have served mainly in the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke, who are considered to be the main drug dealer.
The arrested persons are supposed to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the Sherbrooke Justice Building.
They could be accused, among other things, of the production of cannabis, its property for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches were carried out as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel explained.
About the 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Department and Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be pursued without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which according to the government is to regulate the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, will all be stamped out in advance after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly object to this Charter."
"I am holding a party that has tied your feet to you," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session was held in front of the assembled Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows each person coming from a seaship identified as a transporting illegal immigrants for up to one year, is in breach of the Canadian legal and freedom constitution, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he was unable to support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration issue, NDP, has left the critics who demand that their party did not stand firm enough against the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take measures against the blind passengers, and we are just trying to implement this by means of another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks to blame refugees and keeps children trapped for at least one year," said Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal acts affecting Canada and which treat the country as a step-by-step."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenney's reaction.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a Conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote in order to allow any opposition Members to declare themselves immediately to their voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not least discussed at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year despite Robert Dutil's presence.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the party of Québécois qualified this announcement in pointo public security as "an enchanted rabbit" from the hat as well as "a solution rightly built at a table end".
Minister Dutil, on the other hand, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future unity in question.
"They will see the result when we will announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to withdraw Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, lecturer of ethics and political systems at the ENA (the State College for the Training of High Administrative Officers) said.
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposes to Quebec to grant financial control a special mandate to enable them to conduct investigations on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the audit audit audit mandate", he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec audit could grant the same powers as commissioners, which would also allow her to oblige people to say.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
Quebec will also demand Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so as to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand came from the Supreme Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this way of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Tows, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague from the Judiciary, Rob Nicholson, currently addressing certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people had been arrested, although the Criminal Code had not been revised.
Ottawa has succeeded in enforcing the law against gangsterdom.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall which has occurred since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, an earthquake occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in it.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening heavy rains from 40 to 70 millilitres of rainfall have occurred in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Here a total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had gone down.
As these rainfalls are to be added to the melting snow that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, the abundance of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings on the flood alarm regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the region of Lanaudiere.
The river flows in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, severe rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildar and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte a bridge was cleared due to the heavy rains.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to be alert and closely monitor the situation, according to Security Council Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec National High Water Centre issued warning on Wednesday of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially assigned
The Quebec broadcast moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as because of his outmoded speech about radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their opinion, but certain statements "would have contained inaccurate information about the social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unbridled statement that is inappropriate to the daily broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicides involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide was contrary to the Radio Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the submissions made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed as a result of a complaint by the "Front Commune des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation complained that the amounts mentioned in the shipment were not accurate.
The presenters should rather provide solid as misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message sent was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account the fact that the consequences of the programme "Dupont le midi" would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was seized with no blame on his person.
The final issue was the statements related to the earthquake in Haiti.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media debate that has caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared not to have donated in favour of Haiti's assistance, since it was not certain that the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments have not been of a fraudulent nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already paid my three-day sentence of suspension in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board recommends the dissemination of an unbridled expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "outside its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which should have communicated its decisions once and for all during the main transmission period within a period of three days, are minor.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal’s Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who is in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes as well as in the Thai box, now rises in search of new challenges to the Tatami and to the box rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as kung fu and kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to further develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all places, since for those who present the ground struggle, as the mixed martial arts, do not like to be racing in North America."
Recently, he, working as a security officer and working at UPS, had given his rival bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Cup held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"At the time, I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China."
"There were those fighters from every category who had placed themselves in the last world championship among the first four."
"I was babed in Toronto in 2009 and fetched bronze."
"In 2005 I became aback in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I became a third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where fist strokes and footsteps are permitted as well as floorings.
The two battles usually play on a platform, more rarely in a box ring.
The most prestigious boxer, who has emerged from this kind of martial arts sport, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is probably known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal kept only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the sympathetic Poundscherl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
In the semifinals of his category (80kg), Zemmal had won his first battle before losing in the finals.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the victors of every category will offer themselves the foreheads to crown a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain 1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric power project in mutual agreement.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tender.
This consortium, called the "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as accompaniment to the decision of Hydro-Quebec, the private sector's responsibility to deliver this important hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" denounced the lucrative contract without a public call for tender.
For the party Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem which raises the risk of distortions of competition and increases in prices.
"This is a new way to cut off a game and defuse competition."
"This means that instead of doing short-cut games in a secret way, you are now doing in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently saying that this contract had been a shortened game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she betted, strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and "lack of hardness".
She said it is "the least" that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is commonly used worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in terms of a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its work performance.
The construction process is under way and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition could have taken place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects, is by no means an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflying of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 consortia to be named, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavaline or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Quebec has taken account of this fact in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the fact that the project management contract was approved after agreement has been made.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few candidates, your prices will be faster to the level."
"You have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and say to you, you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the understanding of the people," Laporte reiterated.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the party Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16 , Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344 in the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are probably known as "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had made it sound that the PQ was equally connected with the companies they "funded" before she specified that it was more about their managers.
Barometer Consultant consumption - The "green" label is untrustworthy
Greener, but unscrupulous skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little in the marked brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
Damage, although it bathes in a media-active universe, where it is so mixed with information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain of an inadequacy that makes itself known as a brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed that was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admit that they do not believe in the environment as much as they believe in green corporate advertising, the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke betrays the clever measuring instrument.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands, which declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important for the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is currently experienced by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and doubtful nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer according to the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are distrustful of the declared performance of the green products and services they are trying to lay down.
According to another Communication, over half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from retailers in their district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo Consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness still seems to be holding back from his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they have used public transport in 2010 or preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The addition and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, called on by Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, which had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex of the Daniel Langlois belonging to the eXcentris at Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to give it back its real cinematic function, does not seem to receive what they have demanded.
Although the government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, at its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than the initially hoped-for level, which could lead to an existential solution to favourable conditions, at least according to the sources taken from the state rumors.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected last spring by Quebec, the bid request has been corrected since the summing down again.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the Société developpement des entreprises culturalles (SODEC), François Macerola, to the Minister of St-Pierre, who is directing the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he had sent her a final report.
However, the counterproposal of the cabinet was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to these.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture did not have to provide financial assistance for real estate projects there which he did not have to provide to other cinema halls.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid in contrast.
Cinematographer Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years after the self-funded design of the cinema, which could justify the exemption on the part of the state fund.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, on their part, tax a privately funded campaign, from which they hope to earn a sum of $700 000 to drive the acquisition.
Since spring 2009 only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yacarini, however, has not called off the newspaper "Le Devoir" and is ignored what he and his group hold from the bottom-up proposals they have made.
Secret of the Complex Shaken Canada Ventilated
The new American diplomatic leaders, which were spread by WikiLeaks, reveal the mystery of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the latter's sense of superiority to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations at the time of the election, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were published in public yesterday, offer even more striking details than the mere substantial content to be tapped at.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the time when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on which point the United Nations no longer participates in the missions discussed by its political boss.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"The Canadian political leaders may be much more inclined to talk about internal issues of everyday life than the United States in this election to push the black Peter (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)" he explains.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "heart-breathing silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
" Logically," he says, "it would be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the electorate has in mind as a key factor in the impasse."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the announcement that President Obama is to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa, sent by Terry Breese, businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government continues with the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has been generated by a recovery programme of between 30 and 40 billion dollars," explains Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to delay the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the CBC broadcasts dramatic series of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about such broadcasts as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can observe little subtle incitement to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even abductions for the purpose of hearings performed by the CIA's muscle protrusions.
Another communication goes on to explain in detail how Hillary Clintten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting if Europe was willing to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
On the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed out to the Secretary of State a paper in muncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file."
Finally, let us remember that the minds are heating up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an elderly and Stephen Harper very close-up consultant, had explained through CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "brought away".
He was here referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for the renewal of lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW) which is almost one third of the additional reduction to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the major concrete projects which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of FCKWs released to Earth due to illumination, if the white-flashing pears, which until now represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that would cut global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance sheet, 5 Gt would still have to be subtracted in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white light bulbs 95% of the energy emanates in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice again.
The compact fluorescent bulbs average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has put on the market this week - this company has, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white light pear, indicating the savings possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs produce very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have indicated that compact light bulbs have reserves, because they contain mercury and that they are therefore to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit much more mercury in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report presents in detail the profits that each country would make through this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects to be excited about the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "unadvanced" publication of the results of the presidential election of Côte d'Ivoire immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press spokesperson of the UN Chief.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibilities and to refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had passed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CDI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "go ahead with work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, but the CEI can finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of the election under the name of Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of "fraud" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidency campaign on the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the maneuvers practiced by the UN to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had frightened the president's supporters to go to election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's actions were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo Contractors are now more of the view that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who denied any connection to the ex-rebels, judged the delay in proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even though he did not go so far as to ask for victory.
His partners reaffirm that Gbagbo block the publication of the results as he knows that he has lost; and file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results, be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for these in the event of possible outbursts.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a leading candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% (including the overseas departments to 9.7%) in line with the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, and the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Insee Statistical Office show that the unemployment rate in France is 9.7%).
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% involving the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million people were not employed by the French metropolis in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in unemployment of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% involving the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to IAA data.
The elderly, on the other hand, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% involving overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After an examination of his calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has since 2006 no longer published the monthly unemployment figures.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste management company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), and he was sent to the prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with the suppression of social wealth, the intrusion of general goods, the heathing, the confidant in corruption, illicit bribery and the possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to address all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading brainspinsters."
"It is easy to consider a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, the brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the department, had placed the need to give the judge a reminder of his justification before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A member of the Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also arrested and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than his estate, which he had to direct, to keep running.
He would never have known about the area of business or the target place of the associated fund, says Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne, was also accused on Wednesday of subjugation and complicity, but then under the obligation to stay away from these acts under judicial supervision by the protagonists.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedomů, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and released from custody on the night of Tuesday on Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Waste Management Company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is judicially persecuted due to "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two officials of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, which is due to the title "Intervention and Intrusion of General Goods by a Public Service Officer", the other because of "Communication in the Intrusion of Public Money".
The lifemate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "hire and suppression of social wealth".
Among the people opposite Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained for a similar affair of fraudulent public actions that had affected Corsica.
The flags suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminals' circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public procurement contracts, particularly in the waste disposal sector, will be carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area as well as to certain cities in the Marseille (MPM) urban catchment area.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its middle function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, a young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in alertness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" show some of the reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its American strategy, which went so far as to give this advice on dealing with their own crisis of "given" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and from American justice for trade in material for the benefit of Iranian nuclear programs.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making the idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, into a glaring light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who were being held violently in Iran.
"Magnificent noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without omission" the words "basic human rights", "indebtedness", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to make the Iranian regime embarrassed, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Throw this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
For "Stilling does not solve anything", past the discussion attempts over inconspicuously, the Iranians are "Masters in Divorce Manoeuvring".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic": "commissioning for political extortion".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on 16 August, on the day on which she fled to the French Embassy) "requires payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And it makes to be said, the Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that will "enhance itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago but is still being detained in Iran.
An information was circulated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demand to Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials, has been released from prison following the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow shop?
The liberation of the Iranian from that of the Frenchman ?
On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision" but also tried to resist it.
"There has been a strong exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he says.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "severe" control of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant dials a telephone number, re-opens, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently occupying the buildings run by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
While keeping Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare his efforts to believe by means of announcements and media organized "refugees", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "impact middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" based to Mr. Assad, the Paris message is inquiring.
"Despite their praises, the French authorities admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to fall victim to this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyses.
A policy was launched in 2008, which was perceived as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad.
"The Syrian role building up" tries Paris "to show Syria the promise you can make by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to sow "treasure between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her with this: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything".
"But despite everything we thanked them."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "The Cinderella", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight by blocking access, so indicated government officials.
A bill to call on the online game operators to deny young people access to these games under 16 years after midnight is presented to Parliament in December, portrayed representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family Affairs.
"Many children play these games all night long and thus have difficulties in learning at school and also in having a normal day-to-day life."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the French press press agency Agence France Press's secretary in charge of this draft law.
The online game will be available again from 6 a.m. on the morning.
The manufacturer companies would have had a year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, so he clarified.
The government is also aware of asking manufacturers to cut down the daily limit on access to these games for those young people whose parents are asking for it, the controller added.
It will also make available free programmes to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the country of establishment
In light of suspicion of corruption, on Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the World Cup founders 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the ranking of influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of the FIFA Royal Discipline will be held in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Katar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to pursue its subsidiary in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons associated with the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
So the actions behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It's difficult otherwise to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the introduction of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only once allowed to run the world championship, i.e. 1966.
The BBC had once again fed the ground on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report, which has shot three influential members of the Committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and to embarrass the English leaders, who had been doing an intense lobbying mainly with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of Tony Blair's chess campaign, which had been completed by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to restore the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not missing from its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial disadvantages of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about Spanish and Portugal's solvency have increased Russia's chances, which, despite its gaps in the file (stadien, hotels, transport) has become a significant outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to appeal to the Committee's members the unsavory indication of the accusations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote".
"You throw it with dirt, you try to compromise it," putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA's hot-eyed approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which allowed the Asian chances to fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the anticipation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are more at risk than certain.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by the European countries (due to the shift in time), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: transparency
De Gaulle had really rung.
Mitterrand had let him think he was going to blow.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest reluctance.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery that the presidency's function is not well-faced.
So you have to do it like there was a doubt going on.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac stated that a third mandate was not excluded without themselves believing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy seriously assured him to make his decision "in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would sound the perspective of "two mandates" in the Elysée in front of the UMP Parliamentarians on Tuesday evening had therefore spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely pointed out that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about the phase after that."
His words of yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before, but no less.
Should they make comments, then for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS at an early stage than accepted for fighting.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the survey of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded the Prime Minister's environment immediately and carefully.
"If he were to be defeated as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in being able to win," says Alain Juppé, who has found himself in open knowledge.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of government papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how the crisis emerges or at least to announce the organisation of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to not be able to bring about the present, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to exacerbate their deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in resolving the European public budget debt.
It did not dare to say whether it considered that the central bank could do even more, for example by promoting its programme of government borrowing purchases.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the day before in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, was not very pleased to point out that the government paper purchase programme on the secondary market would be "wide-ranging" and that at the meeting on Thursday we would "see how the decisions will turn out".
Only certainty: the ECB will remain its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the most historically low level since May 2009.
In practice, last week's Treasury bond purchases were doubled to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, she was supposed to have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
The Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the dealers that the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price is in any case called for (see page 29).
There is no longer any remarkable change in the price of the population.
If the borrowing operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will continue to make its way to the unlimited reserves of funds in a free way, for a period ranging from one week to three months.
The people are already concerned that this measure will be extended for a number of months.
"I cannot imagine the ECB changing its programme in a substantial way".
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit scheduled for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," says Norbert Bräms, the economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their intervention on the sovereign debt market, "the ECB would maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that would revive the strong market," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"At any price, she has to step up the market and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest states," testified an important bondholder yesterday.
For if interest rates were to start to rise, States would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or only stabilising.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi Government goes to Italy in cover
After a week's start worrying about Italy, the situation with the decline in interest rates to 10 years has relaxed a little.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, regional presidents Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indispensable" and had heard it expect an "unforeseeable" weekend, which the person demented immediately.
At least on Tuesday, with the German interest rates, the shear would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the bankruptcy risk-covering contracts had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed itself as being "hardly concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a potential risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dwindling tax revenues that threaten the state to no longer cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget is expected to be 1.3% or 2% in the Senate for review.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission estimates that next year's budget deficit will amount to 4.3% of GDP (compared with the 3.9%) and 3.5% predicted by governments in 2012 (compared with 2.7%).
Therefore, also the uproar of a new collective budget, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken", says auditors Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy's IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) less stabilisation progress is required by Italy than by other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, head of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which could lead to the organisation of the previous elections by the end of March.
So there is a little favorable period for a decision making in relation to a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde pointed out it explicitly yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it has been proved on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans clearly hold together, are willing and committed to defend their currency and their currency territory".
Although totally relative - the last recorded deduction from the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of the governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to speak of the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor rating agency had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt record, the probably most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly dependent on banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "political time passes much slower than markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are stepping up discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in the wider sense, their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
This also applies to Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan contains the slogan of unconventional measures to strengthen the euro area countries in the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia Tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in Fernost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit funding, he will certainly prepare the terrain for this.
The first investment expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had been entrusted with supporting the United States in a possible increase in funds mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are calling for structural reforms, particularly in the area of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms to be added to the austerity measures, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different route from that of Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other are at every price to avoid having to ask for international aid before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back their confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to intervene again in its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European sovereign debt in the forefront, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means: the European mechanism of financial stabilisation, currently worth EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board, which has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Above all, when market conditions escalate.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Orange Alert Level
The snow episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alarm stage due to the threatening risk of snow and slippery ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in Orange alarm stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes tang the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow blankets of 2 to 5 cm are also expected from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are remarkable enough to cause road congestion and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tons, including the traffic axes Guingamp Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police who advise against using their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the case of heavy goods vehicles on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "demands drivers to be extremely careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy Paris Airport and 10% of their flights from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfalls.
DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airlines.
Gatwick Airports in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: First financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector at Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been counting billions.
At least in the discussions.
The 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris is recalled in particular.
In order to guide the construction of the SGP, the State has called for a capital injection of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give on the markets part of the financial sum to its double.
Today, we finally got the first bills.
The supplementary budget of 2010, which was reviewed this morning by the National Assembly Financial Commission, contains the measures provided for in order to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on development and higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "for the benefit of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is calculated as follows: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate tax system: "to modernize it, to increase its output and to oversell this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not calculated in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital allocation allocated by the State and will gradually be made available to the Société du Grand Paris for the project", the explanatory statement is given.
This system is not at all offensive to the SGP.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projectation over three years and then first draw from the 4 billion", it is explained.
"This will be recorded in the budget and gradually reduced".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which has been promised for 4 billion years, is in danger of creating a fairly motivated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racist Hacker and Emotional Spions
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a premonition of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a intelligence service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw away nothing more than what one could read for months anyway in every x-any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifying caricatured profile of Gaddafis has provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule according to which the secret files may consist only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and that is not only this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to estheric publications, you will realize that every work (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rose Crusades) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not the only reason why the author does not want to publish any research (yet that he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
And the secret records.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise, he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who considers only true what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy had sent to the state department in Rome, were the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such an uplifting about the revelations of these files made?
On one side they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned into spy centers, with the exception of some small representations.
Every viewer of investigation films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can pick up the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the state decade.
In addition, the scandal brings fewer victims than rather the "gentlemen" in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's time, one could bundle all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Since then, Orwell's prophecy could have proved to be perfectly correct, where one can control any movement thanks to the telephone, any transaction done, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you take a look at what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control will cease to be one-sided and will be circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's revenger - can reveal the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of mystery, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this abuse caused by such a powerful power?
It is obvious that states will not put any reserved information online in the future - that would be the same as an extension glued to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is futile to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret with the current technologies.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that at the moment my prediction sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see it necessary to introduce myself to the government officials, moving secretly on uncontrollable routes, carrying their communications with them nowhere but in memory, and, in addition, hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe store.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the spying attempt by Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that today's technology is progressing like a cancer, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogues) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for tape by rolling from the back to the front and opening all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays do not allow anything other than jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high - speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to come back to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was forged for mystery between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks nicely about its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the quickly resolved financing promises (also called "Fast Start" or early financings) implemented by the developing countries.
And already the coarse French fine speeches are uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the time of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of the fact that they are committed to the fast-start financing: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major ancillary events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and highly valued for its real value: developing countries and civil society like to see all developed countries do the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces its release of EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it on the right path to pay respect for its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional spending has been made without harming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers to be the best.
For example, the EU Commission has identified itself as a benchmark for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and 150 million will be allocated over three years as part of the "Fast start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either year-on-year or state-of-the-art.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative figures for the expenditure of the previous year or at global level of public development aid.
To put it specifically, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decreasing) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this, and everyone chooses its computing mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is only hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission control projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the donor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following considerations: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by accepting 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU to use loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) are paying 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends EUR 1 to fulfil its commitments, France just gives a 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Nice Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: to a part with a further development of the action over time and to the other part with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why do the other Member States continue to donate, if it is sufficient to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing only a small question at a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the balancing of justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another topic that is crucial and currently discussed): it does not escape the question of "replicability" or of the way in which its loans are booked.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as other issues.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "reproachability" as well as the use of loans would naturally lift from the international trust base which is necessary for further discussions.
Alert - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes on 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration character of the problems treated", had between July and September usually bought the four food consumed by a child about ten years of age at meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were also examined as well as the Naziry of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counter balance is low-lying: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe-caricogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptive factors, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in the near future, the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well taken out that the reality that the consumer may be exposed to cancerous substances or substances with endocrine disruptive factors is cause for concern," says the Association.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three proven safe to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an interim period for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungizide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the hack steak, the tuna from the bush, even the baguette and gum from pesticides and other chemical substances were spilt.
With the tap water, the analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light.
At dinner the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues was the most "richest" and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not uncontaminated.
The final risk of this "harmful cocktail" for consumers is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, on the one hand, proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civil diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of residues in Europe identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
