The Prague Stock Exchange falls to the minus against closing of business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ's shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange opened immediately at the beginning of Tuesday's business start from Monday when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time the ground lay for the burglary on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American representative house, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Cases of shares in Asia
A dramatic case on Tuesday experienced the shares on the exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the day.
The index of Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost nearly four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to settle some of the losses, thus reducing the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stock on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange decreased by 3.6 percent according to its index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system in accordance with the words of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise, further countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan for support of the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important share indices recorded the biggest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break-in he had last recorded in 1987.
The index had fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any indications that the draft in the House of Representatives would not get through, the index experienced a free case.
Congress admits: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators made a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
For Congressarians still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The financial support plan will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the president of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, said this to the Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, different information could probably be voted on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a Communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first major psychological factor for a revival of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our various views on what a package should look like for stabilising the market," said Democracy Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to your words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislator met on Sunday with American finance minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets by the financial corporations, which plunge the financial corporations into severe losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definite agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan even further, but I think we are at your destination," says Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also strikingly declining in the stock markets.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators have tried to reach a final agreement before Sunday.
This means that investors should be calmed down from business on the Asian financial markets, which lie in the first time zone, where a congress decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is there any doubt as to whether the negotiations could fail at the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will have some changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be made available as soon as possible as President Bush requested.
The congress can, however, block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with an additional 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush values progress in negotiations positively
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote for his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the programme's basic idea has remained based on obtaining finance for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday", says Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress made.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, was told that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law will also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and establish a committee to supervise the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with paying back their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates with mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
According to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses," said Marek to the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, it does not make any sense to Mareks.
"It is very important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
At this moment, the psychological significance of the agreement to adopt it is the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messer's cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call yet.
So, of course, it looks better to just buy a phone.
In spite of all, there are enough reasons why you should become an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Sure, you can hardly buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you will probably dream of at least one of them.
So it is also with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music, expressed in simple terms - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink-Floyd fan will probably harden the headphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for every one.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even make sense.
No modern device should be used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephoneing and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better one, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, most of the time it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect cheap cell phones to not be able to play more than a few hours of music.
If you make occasional calls, you would prefer to buy a charger for the office for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours continuous operation with one time charging.
There is another problem when you want to play the music over the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be finished without any reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
In the case of players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players set up a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When selecting a specific device, you should in particular check out the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, also the ease of use.
If music is mainly for you and listen to it every day just for example in the tram, then any cell phone that MP3 files play will suffice.
Which really can almost any cell phone.
You also don't have to control specifically which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will just be in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself for why one should put on a musical handicraft.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is poor and usually limited only to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, one assumes that this kind of sale of music ( via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone carries most of it.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player forgets at home.
It is important, however, whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless freephone.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker, which has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of the musical handicrafts will probably be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are present.
The best and most advanced phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
In turn, the advantage of the player lies in easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity of operation with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrifying bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you grab now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for replaceable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding map, there are enough two thousand crowns.
But respect.
For base models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Listen to the more demanding listeners, take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes to a single MP3 player.
The most common is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum) provide you with MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe it won't be long before it's ready.
That the Czech mobile service providers work at all costs in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile communications providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a battle dance.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100%.
On the other hand, mobile service providers are happy to complain that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) named Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find any frequency).
But there is one other option - a virtual provider.
Virtually the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market led to a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile service providers had to respond to.
There were similar votes to those in the Czech Republic before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you do not need to look for examples for a long time.
In February of this we reported on the start of the virtual provider mobilizing in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the fifth largest provider in the country.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind mobilization.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers normally profile themselves as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half the cheaper than its competitors.
However, as shown by the example of mobilizing in Poland, it can also be a pretty good move to set itself on a non-clerical target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Echte Kerle vällen Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could take a foothold in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment, on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In Czech Republic, mobile service providers mean
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobilizing.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press representative of the financial group Penta, says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková.
Indirectly, they confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to do so.
On the contrary, they try to do everything in their power to ensure that no potential competitor emerges.
Your interest in a virtual mobile service provider has long been showing the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
With some of them we were already able to reach negotiations," said the press spokesperson of Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe now's a better time.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is highly specific to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Martina Kemrová's press spokesperson adds in rare accordance with the O2 statement: "Up to now, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project that could be built on."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will hardly show up a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At that moment, we should already have a specific offer to be able to think so in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we consider to be the best from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider is called more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be facilitated to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can draw on a string when it comes to something also proves the long way to and fro about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was reported by the company T-Mobile when U:fon arrived on the market.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is exactly the argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been reinforced by the entry of a fourth mobile service provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and in particular its services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is astounded.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately, unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It has exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem, its very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such agreement has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," says Kristian Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised at such a wording.
This is more than a concern of an authority representing consumer interests, which is intended to ensure, among other things, that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristian Chalupa adds: "From abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
But probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost already touching consistency of the three mobile communications providers, resulting from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question is whether it is really just a coincidence.
Just as the very same price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly only coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"In this matter, the Authority has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive action, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their market behaviour.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulatory authority," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile service providers have a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile service providers behave remarkably similarly.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they encounter very similar obstacles during negotiations with all suppliers.
The shifting of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to extend the ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but probably they have other interests.
It's okay when no one's looking.
Without notice, the operation of any pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
They are usually companies that operate in the multi-level marketing sector.
Own mobile telephone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke is that the company appears to the operator as a classic business customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar types of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a breach of the contractual terms with which we will then deal, which may lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
It is, however, quite unlikely that such a thing does not apply to the operators responsible for mobile communications.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an operation.
Because the activities of these companies do not lead to negligible profits, at the same time, they are not affected by the actual official marketing, in contrast to the actual virtual suppliers.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
Moreover, they have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full access to it like the normal customers of the mobile service providers."
However, the ČTÚ alone would have to be at least strange.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
Before such a procedure, the mobile service providers close their eyes, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It is added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy the declaration of the providers, they knew nothing of it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As pointed out several times in the text, the market entry of virtual operators led to a significant price decline in the various services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual providers have come into existence, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which did not attempt to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers, intervened at these very moments.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator arose, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves all over like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot escape the impression that ignorance in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon emerges, the Czech mobile market may soon be reinvigorating.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And the Czechs will not finally call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the day of the Czech Statehood.
The hymn was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female Sologesang, in choir composition and in an instrumental version.
Kateřina took over Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server, you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
Earlier he had told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo versions, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried both at the choir and then also with the choir to keep a clear division so that one understands the text well so that a harmony can be established," said the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Standetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song then became an organic component of the national anthem after the Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" hymn
The Prague transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport companies as a date on which the first passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus, which will carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket.
These currently account for about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or one-year coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and record it simultaneously on their chip cards, in the Info Centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available since yesterday via the Internet on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used until the afternoon by over four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly for their paper licenses in long queues.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places, a switch with trained staff is also available to travellers, advises the prospective person when he buys the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on self-service vending machines on the Opencard, which are mounted in some subway vestibüls.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remember the driver's rating, the passengers may already have noticed in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is simple.
Only the chip card has to be inserted, and the previously purchased coupon is recorded by itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings.
Thus, in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia mainly enter the capital.
"In the trains that belong to Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices that allow them to check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organization Rapid. This organisation compiles the timetables for Prague's traffic operators.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's checkout.
When entering, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the open card must be displayed at a marked place at the side of the checkout.
The driver thus controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than the driver to ask for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive on suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can, in turn, go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had sought to join the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is reflected in a letter stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans should have turned to the US presidents.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has remained in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units enter the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "People who are at the heart of the fate of the Sudeten."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia has led the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - to assume that they would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over protection over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a state that is foreign to us, which has oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities, and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies," is to be read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge on the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he were to initiate a referendum in Bohemian Forestgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the postwar history may sound somewhat naive, he does, in the opinion of some witnesses, draw a good picture with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to think that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the UK to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis, is also confirmed.
He was used as a Budweiser at the Navy on the Baltic Sea during the war.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a concentration camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, and he was to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would come to pass," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
In this way too, the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could be characterised.
The Department of Minister Aleš
The 150 million crown campaign will run on television, on radio, in cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to reduce drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to ride around.
The campaign wants to raise the awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, in particular, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are on a sign in capital letters.
And then the word "pay" is in a blood smile.
This should mean that you can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with your own life.
The spots will be "shocking" the spectators by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with dramatic photographs of victims of accidents.
It is a promise that the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and whip for the motorists
"The motto for the riders is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when they ride red, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says the traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Martin Kořán hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, the fact that drivers are less effective is less effective.
"If you put up a static board warning of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the riders will no longer perceive them," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria can be achieved in exchange.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to resign to the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include Ostjerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to refrain from part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in connection with two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens injured.
Following the words of the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "Special Solution for the Templars and Sacred and Historical Places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he continued.
Subtract from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal from the Golan Heights of Israel, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require certain efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert reiterated.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to refrain from getting back the Golan hills.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with the (sliite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they will have to give to the terrorism of the (sliite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terror network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister put into practice.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards illegal on the bus?
The law doesn't know them, in a long-distance bus the roundabout is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus by the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether Stewards and travellers can walk and run on the bus during the journey.
"If we wish to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says the spokesman of Karel Hanzelka, Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old Stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the road to the bus.
At this moment, the young woman sat at all accidents next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake hard at the moment, where the Steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces after the registration.
If this is not on the bus, travellers must sit.
The long distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not at first agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that passengers may go to the toilet while travelling," he said.
The law doesn't know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle attendants, but whose rights and duties do not define it," adds the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka.
On the other hand, the Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law covers this issue afterwards.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product registration also has standing places.
That's all," he stressed.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the airplane, says the expert
The BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid route, there are not many hazards, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Also here is not sure when turbulence comes, and the Stewardess can hit his head."
"However, if a bus is hot, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The security of the Stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency offers as the only bus company services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his/her profession risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the Steward's profession is risky, I'll delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers on boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his bus. However, his company only operates a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we'll defend ourselves from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end with some fatal accident," he had not said for Tyden.cz a year ago.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a scheduled bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region was injured who had worked for two years for society.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off without blinking from the stand strip and had blocked the bus's ride.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid using a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
Jančura argues that the two places had been sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the Agency will not wait for the court’s judgment, but a financial compensation is expected on the part of the debtor.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regime in which a thirty-member expert team of the Ministry of Transport already works for over a year.
"However, this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the highest speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones during the journey," says professional Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Stewards to be a major threat to the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, controlling the safety of buses in the competence of police and occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, there is no lack in the letter of the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the house.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created," says the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB broke into such a business a "competence block" with sustainable yield.
And at all events, such a link could be the decisive impetus to further groupings in the Landbank sector.
This is the case if a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the beaten WestLB remains under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian government recently made clear, it was time to find a solution to the future.
However, the WestLB has been talking about a connection between the deka bank, which customers know about its investment funds, as always, and the WestLB has been talking about the Frankfurt side for some time.
At the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas made a presentation of the semi-annual figures.
However, the Deka’s Board of Directors, each half of which is held by the Landesbanken and the savings banks’ associations, has instructed the Management Board to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just begun at the financial station.
From the deka bank, which is one of the more important employers in Frankfurt's financial centre with its 3000 employees, it is not the first time that we are talking about consolidation in the savings banks sector.
In 2003, it looked as if the deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba for a moment.
However, there was nothing from this trio.
The plans had hardly become public, the Hessian government opposed the Helaba’s participation in them.
The other two houses did not find one another.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been puzzles about a connection of the deka bank with Landesbanken.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, spoke against plan games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to mature the realization that a collapse of the different houses of the public-law sector is in need.
After the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, the first thing could be a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, you go out gradually to the partners for it.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has so far managed the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved in the Helaba at 85 percent, has put a stop to a meeting with the West LB at the beginning of the year.
At least the north LB.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only the one side.
On the other hand, it is a question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl, the decisive question with which business model to ensure the future ability of Landesbanken, had not been answered by the German savings bank and Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a division of the West LB, which is not, of course, desirable there.
In this way, in the letter of the Management Board there is the talk, it will certainly seek a "total solution" for the house.
How that can be put under a hat with the deca bank with the merger of individual units will still be shown.
The second Wiesnwochenende is known as the "Italian Weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so be everything else, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built baker and proves to the about 200 October festival travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a kiss first, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, will start at 23.45 this evening four buses, "destinazione Monaco, fasta della birra", arriving expected at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, in a bus travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, celebrating already at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with furzimite lining and a glasses with wide silver irons, includes the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, day after day on the meadow, at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary spices, says Marco.
75 Euros costs the journey, the welcome roundabout with Kaiser-Beer, faithfully brewed the Bavarian purity bid, the health insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian marks on the motorway 8 shortly before Munich take another break.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the early hours, 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, in addition to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors rise to the beer tent, it is said to run!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the spaces in the back part of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, distribute in space!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to drink.
"Safety men show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave, they'll be gone!"
Third, "Find out the point half-eleven today!" Do you understand?
And we're gonna go take a walk.
On the way, a yellow cap binds the trees, signs and even the electoral plaque of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be armed for retreat.
It is known as the second Wiesnwochenende, as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; the speech is from 50 000 who are on their way across the Alps and enter the beer tent, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to be from Italy on this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which provides a national statistics, in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 stakes) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
The farm is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, and Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only emphasised last week.
How well that the politician used the word "relative" and even imported that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis-like developments.
It has now arrived at the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to be mindful of the part they also claim.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
Background are losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the public financier had refinanced himself extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero over the previous period, the yields from subscriptions to receivables and certain securities and from the liquidation of deposits in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only with a higher return on payments of deferred settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Deppa Group, as well as with the reimbursement of interest on the basis of the tax rules and from the business services for group companies, had the income reduction of around 16 percent still been moderate.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former State financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been disaggregated into Aareal Bank.
Due to the poor value of classical government funding, the Deppa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects by private investors and the state (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
To the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciations that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is called quite uncertain.
The fact is, the dividend was deleted.
Already for 2007 she had been shortened by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financier since the Deppa takeover.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market than other institutions, since it has no client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is largely out of stock, as banks have their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a share of the credit portfolio of Deppa's short-term refinancing funds for some – about 50 billion euros each year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan over a foreseeable period of time and the company is shielded from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets.
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the money, the refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
The CEO of the HRE Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets at the foreseeable time.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the Bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there seems to be no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that the financing does not have to be used in full.
But the opposite is also not tossed out.
After the late Sunday evening of hearing after the bank was still ahead of insolvency, the least temporary rescue also cannot calm the moods.
The share price falls by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite good.
If the senior debt is barely moving, the rates of the after-range bonds are more pronounced.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the maturing periods beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds previously appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their worth must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, after the significant worsening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the Deppa crisis.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-advanced commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it may be assumed that the pension will be cancelled on time.
Or it will happen, what hardly anyone is currently expecting - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the announcements which have been handed down by the partial nationalization, there is currently only a legitimate hope that there will be a security-bounding probability.
This is particularly likely for long-term believers to prepare some sleepless nights by deciding whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors may at least use a strike to form a loss presentation for future tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tacibana High School, the girls begin to look: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a bat before I left school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive for 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone. Fortunately, I didn't walk.
The start of the class at the Tachibana doesn't seem as strict as at our home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock until about twenty before nine a brief meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was in line to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people about this, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I've dressed an old skirt for my guest mom, blouse, blue knee skirts and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language well over two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all cuddled, peeked and waved and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survivalal vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'beneficial, sweet'.
Then I quickly got my seat.
The girl next to me grinned pretty wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when Gong sounded, I was really stunned.
Everyone talked and peeked and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My guest mother had made me a lunch box like this - that's something different than the deserted German breakaways.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, lettuce from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in tofu mantle.
Mostly I don't have a pale shimmer, what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's solid that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, perhaps, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-prepared Bento to a boy, who then teaches her particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during a break.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm excited to see if I can watch this.
'Why do you expect Japan?', my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and culture in it, I started to learn a little Japanese some time.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a faible for tradition, customs and customs.
And on that one you put great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats too have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees at risk means that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same way if they behave the same way we do?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of sensation or general consciousness, we enter inpermanent terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, she does the same thing as many other animals: she sets herself dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude on a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in the short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, one could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, probably differed very much from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it doesn't measure or, because of the special hardware, can be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more easily accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What happens to the sensations now?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his own activity conscious brain.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are located when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its consequences, as physical reactions) proves memory.
Thus, sensations are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, the primates and especially the people.
Linked to the linguistic nature, fine degrees of sensation arise because we can differentiate and categorize with the help of the words and grammar states, in order to attribute them to ourselves as well as others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, says that sensations from primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of Cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-density sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict that, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and humans, such as fear, in both cases, it is likely that this is the case: but how can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees at risk whether she too feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot prove any equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain stems, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to people, how did you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and on speech), I would rather explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
At any rate, progress at the neural level is waving if the same thing is measured for rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, even if not sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You might think this is shortsighted, but I'd rather move forward than run against a wall all the time.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to host the EM together with Poland," said Watjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are luring behind.
Even the number of EM levels may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian president Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep us constantly in mind."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer from it."
In the past season alone, several first-timers had been convicted of manipulation of forced descent, and in the end, even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Intruder Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outete her missing Dennis Quaid as a adulteress.
The foam - and beats back.
Late Rosenwar at the ex-Ewy Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after her divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant fight with each other - in all public.
Meg Ryan had expressed himself for the first time in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week to the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Jennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has only brought them into experience after divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - tells the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Unbelievable" it was, said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "Meg repeatedly chews and reconstructs the history of our relationship".
It is also "deplorable" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently been the father of Zwillingen.
And so close his registrations with the page above: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Lower prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and determined a significant decrease in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays in many places have already been approved.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
Most clearly, the trend in Paris and Rome had been, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees as the cause the weak dollar price that has led to a "degressive travel pleasure of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London were also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter was also upward in air prices:
On average, passengers in the Economy class had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even more expensive than 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices increased even more than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the reason for the price collapse was the declining economic growth, explains the company.
Demand breaks in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open-Skie Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
The current situation was characterised by the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as by the high number of airlines that had filed bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe were these 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still cannot find a working eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge break landing for national players Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only got into the game late and failed with an lever to the latte.
His message was precise, she went convincingly over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not lost in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were sitting back on their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a higher reputation than some lost actor.
And so his request also found hearing in charge.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to the thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
This command is read similarly: Here with gate two!
The implementation was delayed.
"It wasn't all good to see today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wished for it "to be more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1.0) is due to the head ball hit by Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol put together.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 on this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to organize this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate evidence stands for the incalculability of the league more than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-obligated accesses - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the gatekeeper Petric and the Jansen thrown off the FC Bavaria - find themselves slowly, but they still can't shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote
It's about fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused Dow Jones to break in by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points within one day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught up with something.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer recorded well five percent in the minus at 10,579 meters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was more than seven percent in the minus at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at this time was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs gave up about ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Großinvestor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
The rescue plan is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid out on one impact, but on a step-by-step basis.
In return, the State should receive stock options notes from financial corporations, which could be redeemed in the event of corresponding price developments, in order to reduce the burden on the state funds.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downwards search
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not resolve investors' doubts.
The stock price of the German Grossbank Hypo Real Estate falls and tears down the Dax.
The US Index Dow Jones loses despite the planned saving of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have taken the German stock index (Dax) to a low point.
Despite the rescue operation of the German government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier lost approximately three quarters of its value, which Commerzbank left more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000 point mark and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets went to their knees.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollar rescue package could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back into motion.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which could follow the Senate vote on 1 October.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially decreased by 3.2 percent, and the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese index of nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 meters after initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the slope-seng index dropped 2.1 percent to 18,286,90 points.
In India the index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 meters.
In the MDAX, shares of Arcandor surrendered after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook were not sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon of research has caused a lack of advice: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
Nearly 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel lines, you are now threatening the cold dust.
For years, scientists have been creating a mysterious phenomenon of confusion - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This enables the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens European-American research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What the researchers have been amazed at for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected by the old-fashioned Gravitation Act.
Rather, there are irregularities at the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite right.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly with the help of so-called dark matter that astronomers have formed in the universe.
"The anomaly could be responsible for dark matter that could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously assumes an attraction whose effect can be seen on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After all, according to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter makes up a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the tourists to Egypt were to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages are supposed to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Solving money negotiations should already be under way.
Germans always went to the sights of kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who have been towed in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian State TV, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release following reports by the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're checking her state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well up and in security, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition should already be on their way to Cairo.
The backgrounds of a shooting remain unclear before the hostages were released: hence, according to information from an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the abduction before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "just about receiving the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported under appeal to a German mediator who delayed the release of the hostages because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to the death of a woman has been reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The court in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Ms. Randle died at her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied her eyes and tied her up before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time in honor of the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse that had been imposed on her twice a week.
Public Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "gave up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession, who ended up saying, "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't have sex with her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely alien fetishist and for their victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, as described by Stephanie's father and mother, of her actions on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would certainly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for data lost shall be charged with:
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents on one move in June, will be charged with the "Public Security Act".
The man was abducted from the Ministry of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on one train to Waterloo.
The papers were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would have been an internal problem at the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be called, shall be sued in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe retention of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he presented contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in mind
British housing companies could stand in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits of 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Building Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are extinguished.
However, the interest collected in the meantime is charged to the 700 financial undertakings which receive deposits each year.
The financial compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay around 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies must raise 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the association of housing companies, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently during the real estate upturn will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
"We will monitor all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will fall due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been carried out.
Retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused bail on the charges 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheich Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released from bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government grant her full freedom at first.
Correspondents say that, although their detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear within the framework of their release whether they will be able to remain free when they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail claim because it says that she does not have to receive a bail because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers claim that they need security to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance party president on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheich Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated in the recent anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations implemented a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder thousands of employees who carried out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses claim in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing ITV.
The Competition Tribunal has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorts competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the stake in ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom communication office have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced its intention to abandon its voting rights.
New investigation in U.S. Attorney's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine U.S. state attorneys in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Justice criticising the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, legislators and former Advocate General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The specialist researcher Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the investigators who were interrogated during the investigation have lied to prevent the judiciary.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said the Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the power to force the witnesses to make a statement was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when in December 2006 the Ministry of Justice challenged nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed because of a lack of employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud.
US prosecutors are assigned to investigate and prosecute cases before the government.
They may be released at any time, but they may not be suspended for political reasons.
The former head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has been fired because of the redundancies and has established his office in the final effect.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has critically addressed the role of Gonzales, bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, having shown his leadership role "distinguished" and being "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honoured
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for its epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize next week in London during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" points out the nominations for the award of this year after it has been selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song appeared in Great Britain as a single in 1979 and has reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute keel inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscured street in town, often forgotten and possibly to sell soon
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing residents to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than after an active highway.
There are no road signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to refurbish Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other guests is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council's Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district administrator in the Council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city and we would like Extra Place to continue to hear the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and run the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road would refurbish and refurbish seats intended, among other things, for a café that the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it didn't want to have it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost street and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the building protection department said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably best known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who wrote about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dying City"), has published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, which had appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and flying weekly newspapers passing raindrops."
With a few exceptions, the street has just looked like it in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the driveway in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in English-speaking environments
In this issue of "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, head of science in California studies and director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of successful schooling in African-American and Hispanic students is lower than in white students" - what is true.
In order to close this performance gap, Obama's educational plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in training for those who only learn English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance between school and school.
Let's take the example of Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from families with low incomes.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 an amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of fourth-year-old children were rated well in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
School Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practises the approach of education in an English-speaking environment. That is the point that Obama should pay attention to, says the school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach places importance on the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize him.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English students?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easier, but the educational positions within its own party (the National Associations of Fine Arts have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by saying that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise them and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed economic fears
The oil price on Monday is strongly affected by the fears that even the American financial market rescue plan could not be enough to revive the economy.
In the morning's session, the New York Stock Exchange's crude-oil futures fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have shown concern again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan at the weekend, which should be the greatest in history.
This news was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the most recent chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is supposed to buy up the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
After analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not succeeded in reviving the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a communication to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the coming year and reduced their forecasts for the 2009 oil and gas price by 20%.
Team record set up by series in the second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he saw everything after he spent the last eight and a half years more often than anyone else in the Jets tricot.
Then on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets turned an unprofitable game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like this before," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favre's Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start for an afternoon in which her developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which one time took off as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't put up much effort," Coles said about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were catching, the defense of Quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis caught an unfortunate throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The cardinals had captured the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot into a 34-to-0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
The two answers, because in the third quarter the jets left 21 points without a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time."
Unspoiled Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some think of him for the best long-distance runners of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first man to make the 42.2 km track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Bürselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least a world championship title or a world record on each route from one kilometer to the Marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie released the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which was perhaps exaggerated afterwards, that air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long-distance tracks, the record time for marathons has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramped in his Wade two weeks ago and therefore could not train a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not return.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I took the training again a week ago and had a few more concerns today, but at the end everything was great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa - that he orchestrated his race excessively, many of the world's best marathon stars generally avoid relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a rail race, and put world records on the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of bürselassies as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the course in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after leaving the pacemakers behind.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last attempt to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing with 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned to run her way by first exorcising a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but was over 30 kilometers away.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and rigors in the lives of the black population, in a city of the very special kind
Hidden between the outgrowths of leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drive, is a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three hot spots, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist outing destination – is and remains in the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the Bundesschriftenprojekt – in many respects a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, distinguished and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what goes wrong with him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion about racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from the birth of a resident of the city and a parishioner of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be true."
Eatonville was defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle for a long time.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the black culture, sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so correctly, the concerns about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as all Hurston call here.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida traveler changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the sites of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Besides the street to the left," she wrote, "there is the brown white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-also-fits hours rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus brought Eatonville into contact with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized the Hurston by quoting the men, singing songs about their beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston was brewed into the city, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that today imagines something of its venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and lost her books.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
There was no great commemorative celebration in Eatonville, no public reading in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or her heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston that was published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4 motorway through the western outskirts.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the congregation.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred to the community.
"At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston questioned in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision in the case of Brown against the School Council "respecting rather than my race".
Inhabitants today say that although the withdrawal of racial concentration was positive in some respects, it weakened the group's cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students came out of the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, the civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have turned their backs on prejudices, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelfs, and made it again part of the American literature canon.
The long-distance project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what could destroy the district by constructing the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-gauge long-distance street revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused real citizens' pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more train trips, such as Rachelle Munson, an attorney who went to church since 1993 and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of Eatonville's history and its significance are often treated with caution.
For most interviews, a prior authorization is necessary and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her sheltered community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, as silly and melancholy as any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college, to work in the city administration or in the police department, who according to him could use some help.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only run through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York you speak fluent Financial Latin.
Nothing has changed at first sight.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass façades, bankers and hedge funds managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror work day since the fall of 1929.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal tea-coats along side side sidewalks and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slump around apartments like human packers loaded with around the 50 iron T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for the citizens' rises on their breakfast bowl and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, due to all the world's downtime speech, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to lay my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people queueing.
Not at the money switches to raise or deposit money, but at the customer service switch where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them in front of me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal banker with license", was for the same reason as I was Snake.
In contrast to me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, from places where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state and say that they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, went home in bankruptcy management over and as the last Friday New Yorker spent the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings facilities worth $440 billion, looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another crash, the office and shop workers brought their bars before me to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorker has acquired a running financial Latin in the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket took up so much familiarity with Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and their demagogic Chairman Dick Fuld, as if she were blatant about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, who about the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has escaped from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I'm not going in a risko anymore."
Muslim graves damaged during right slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Bezug, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is shown, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend at the extreme right party has significant gains in the country's choice of parliament.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the Traun Cemetery near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminals consider this to be an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said she was "deeply shaken" about the news of the grave desecration, which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan ends.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country sank to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties who received almost 30% of the votes, stood in their election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their electoral claims were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headclothes and Burkas and even expressed his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme rights are the most politically strong bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of sexual abuse of children, was legally forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judges posted a six-month lock on Glitter after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted the last Thursday to impose a travel ban after they provided the judges with proof of Glitter's punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
EIn Speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday 25 September, the police asked Kent at Ashford District Court to allow Mr. Paul Glad's travel abroad to France and Spain by 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present personally."
According to the register for sex offenders, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The Kent police said she would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokesperson from Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the prime concern of Kent police to protect Kent's inhabitants and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control, and he flew to Hong Kong after some of them.
The Chinese authorities also refused his entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge County Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked permission to ask to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, interior minister Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that glitter was kept from travelling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no skirts, no costumes for appearance.
The nature of the great flamencot dancers who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this site he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of flamenco, reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day, explains the artist and makes it clear that 'flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thereby move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', took a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands Flamenco: `Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
This is not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, was and was the firm aim of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotomata the next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to pick up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'Portrait of the Veterans of Sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a great deal of pleasure in photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their condition of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult type.
You meet or bump into people, personalities that you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the Flamenco today titled `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's just writing is 'a great quality'.
He doesn't know where the novel is going and what it's about yet, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he's currently working on, a novel with protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project with which he is engaged is `a great quality' and `everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
'If I was wise, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel', so he ended his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and gave her voice to most of the people present, is compared to the old edition of `Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen in the Juan Bravo theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: as his appeal to literature was created from 'extraordinary adventure', from 'joy reading' and from 'more experience than before'; as he writes and 'discipline preserves', in order to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his appeal and what 'memory images' are the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure what one can measure and how one can know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', said Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'makes effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writer 'don't leave the ease' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfighting fell in part.
After the reported bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the feast was to be concluded in Pozoblanca, was moved on yesterday morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to move the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was subjected to the inconstant weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second proposed bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullrings.
That's just how there was a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut down three ears and triumphed after he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had more been accomplished by galloping than by his bullfighting.
Even worse was El Juli, who passed through the arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava two persons wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, Armiñon (Álava) city area.
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and they took refuge.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State announced.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the region of Álava had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the urban area of Armiñon.
She decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of the road after a few kilometres. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee across a country road to a forest area.
The police in the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hash bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and deflecting the bundle to other police departments.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was 'double', so that it did not match the markings given in the car papers, which is why there was also a arrest for falsification of official documents.
The city of Ertzaintza police continue to investigate the arrest of the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A. J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station to be heard. He will be brought to the jailer in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A Witness observed how she tried to get out of her park gap in Montecito in a rather strange way, California police spokespersons reported the magazine 'People'.
The witness told us in detail that Locklear pressed through a gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking gap, and when she drove back, she caught hold of her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the Witness, who at first had probably not known the actress, saw Locklear on a nearby street and left the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'anguished around Locklears'.
When the police line came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street and thereby blocking the traffic.
'They seemed to be unorthodox', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to test.
According to a police officer, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcoholism was excluded from the first moment. `Following the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation about 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left Andalusian Association is responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and United Left Members, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out what action the party must have against it, who is so far sitting as a city council in the Municipal Council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparence' in the possible investigations of the violations of rules that Silva might have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should receive the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous insurrection of the Spanish against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for shooting.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to portray 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he always admired at the works of the famous novelist, today Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday will be presented in cinemas and later shown on the station Telemadrid as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdó's literature, assures us that thanks to this film his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to film a memorial film for the second century celebration on November 2 in Madrid. Especially because history is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million, made for shooting by the autonomous community of Madrid, Garci offers, as he has provided, the 'one-off opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of 'disturbed Spain', which chose the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been put back by the struggle for independence and under the domination of the Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to count with the funding of `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci almost worked his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empazar', took part in his usual way of working: he presented himself on stage to the actors with whom one has to test first before one starts shooting and for those who had not made casting, he appeared to 'demeaning' and respect, 'part of the job of the film director is to provide help in theater and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many performers he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés', nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
`At the beginning you believe you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's only going to thrive, and now you're satisfied if you've produced a movie', Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first female fighters to emancipate the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist vegetarian and opposed the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell her about her life without keeping her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance grounds helped me a lot in Flamenco.
`The dance of butterflies' occurred to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of snake' like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic field', she claims.
The staging is based on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again at one of their performances, as he did in `La puerta aberata'; and with Flamenco champion Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students in exceptional cases.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honoured.'
The staging also counts with musical composition and guitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with actor Juanfra Jurarez, he takes on the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in whom he always falls in love.'
In this work one also tells in a certain way of the life of this woman, who has been known in such far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
'I wanted to remind her of her, because I think she is one of the women who have a tremendous influence on a particular era and whose works are no longer appreciated today, and therefore they are even less appreciated,' Bayón claims.
The show will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poet recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the day of death of both.
Thus, the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel Chopo de Luz', which was opened in May and, after which it was in various places in Andalusia, has now reached New York and is presented during the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poet recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The USA can imagine badly without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence came from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then dominant idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look what it cost him to give the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford crying, `my life and my country were the greatest fools of his life.'
No one was afraid of either making himself ridiculous or exaggerating.
As the 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and of market collapse prevails, in which American self-esteem in the hopeless search for reasons of dignity is suppressed.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodies a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses as well as gains: from the foundation that committed itself to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, which died of overdose, was founded up to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort for him to impose himself against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of amazement strikes haushoch over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar Prize winner, said that the work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`Uns has left the greatest of all of us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to trust themselves today as Paul Newman lived: high standards of integrity have been maintained, leading responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries it, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a filet at home?' he joked often himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily customary in America.
"Of all the great roles which he played, he was not so proud as of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and those of the Philanthropist," they say.
The streets in Madrid are deficient for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with everything in and around it.
Of course, it is a lot of nonsense if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, that would clearly not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to me to be bad either, but if they let you do it, they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid the congestion on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt there was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it true that after the crisis it was decided only to buy small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had succeeded once, but it would be more difficult to recover.
In addition, it looked like in these 40 minutes waiting for rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like I will not even appear in the classification in time because of this chip I have received, I can already think that the output has been incorrectly stamped out.
Of course, if you were to ask me for a perfect road, this road would never bother me.
So I think we'll dream of a city that's well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system takes note of what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this `receptionist' can recognize how many people are in space, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also group the participants after the conversations into the groups.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that conducts their conversation, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary equipment, instead of filling them with commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is only a statement if you consider that Microsoft has added some feature and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right to lose the operating system gradually in importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Skillfully, many point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the 'window'.
What is half of the use in the computer of existing applications?
Less Is More
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, less exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, no doubt. I give a small example of it.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshing beverage automatic: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used research on the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it is part of a well-built pastor's clothing.
If we start counting the countless stars appearances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard, who had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waistless.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells us that the birth of the name is linked to sport and stems from the Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' overlooks all because of its outstanding cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (no matter) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, trousers made of cotton, t-shirts with stripes, babes, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate.'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mondica Cruz is lovely, but full of life's joy.
The siblings Gruz are taking their new business very seriously in fashion.
For Monica it means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango, moved to her residence and also made the presentation of the most important prizes in the fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I have also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50's and 60's; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women as they are dressed, as they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roll around my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to look after the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in classes and at the rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You just turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, something.
I feel better than ever when I'm thirty years old.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time now I have known that I am a mother because that requires my body and also I want to be a young mother; I do not want to let that escape.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will convey great happiness to my child and bring it up with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and the last year was filmed.
That is the same and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the driveway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two items from our collection were auctioned for Mango to collect the money for Naomi’s NGO.
The people don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of things going on about her, and I'm telling you, as the one she knows, they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The motorists, who can fall back because of the alcohol level, will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, install in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholic then the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report by the Public Prosecutor General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project which will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialise the driver, which is why he is given a course for the re-education of traffic.
In addition to the State Attorney General's Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will be involved.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers, who were shown more than once as a result of driving under the influence of alcohol, were re-introduced.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents auto start when the driver has made the alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by those who impose the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the infringements in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to initiate this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality at 17:40 a.m., at the time foreseen by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport landed the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force, with the prince and prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays were still forced to use the hand as a parachute to see the royal pair that got out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so there can be no people at the airport at this time you are from here or so
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, that's good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who give off the ointment of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the prince, with long woven hair by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official succession awaits.
At the door of the hotel in which they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and Bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talent.
This is awarded with a money price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the showhouse of the Mango branch at Boulevard Haussmann Number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are linked to thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart, which was broken by the pain, because his brother recently died, snapped together. He dressed the suit from the fashion house and had some jewelry from Elah who were breathtaking. He held himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango's house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the baron of red shield without jackets, because jacketts they borrowed the ladies.
Mondica Cruz, has hurried to the shop and had a trousers and shirt on which she herself modeled, and to dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a sort of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always calls for a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bedclothes and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without any smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 advice against stress
There's not 1000, but one more way to forget about chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, all are collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookshops on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office means the tension and the computers that lead to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems that are being eliminated from the working world.
But the number is increasing, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each one.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax', and so the peace which conveys the book comes into the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the body's balance and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the couch, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in the Sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be afraid, but in reality this has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among the children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the child can remember nothing the next day.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panicn fear at night, Enuresis noctura (betting noses at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stress situations or overburden.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite an opposite (scream, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and advised to be advised by a specialist to check if there is a problem which causes and is thus caused by anxiety.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnoea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to exaggerate the child before sleeping.
So, quiet play for the child chooses and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and something too wild.
For the nervous children recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When the speech occurs in sleep once, the peace of mind is preserved.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day nothing will remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be frightened after a few appearances, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put under pressure to conduct a hearing and obtain more information.
Thus you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you'll hear what it says, but you won't know what it's dreaming and why it says so, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it draws from it.
Maybe, don't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even joking.
It causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Firehouses ... finally
After a long Durststrecke, Illhäusern is finally on the field again on success course.
Without much effort, the yellow blacks played many Torchances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers tried to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the Gastkapitäns Kauffmann, whose distance was close to the corner, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and it was only possible, alternately, to challenge Fonderflick with a television shot, then Hirn with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with a foot tip, the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two torchances fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhäuser through Marais, who was exactly right to resume a ball which had been defeated in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-hausian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which forced his teammates to continue playing under the rank.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems of an ill-hausian Elf, who withdrew only a little to 'dead' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fisherman
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to come to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet its representatives.
The latter promised to receive him with a constructive spirit and hope that he would come with concrete proposals.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, established by the Breton fishermen, to enforce measures in view of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their businesses become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of seafarers.'
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they launched protest marches in Morbihan and Calvado, which caused congestion of nearly ten kilometers in length.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was bounded with a barrier.
Already on Monday the sailors gave expression to their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread out on other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel of Sables, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishbutter did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuver of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to be held in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Committee on Crisis in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give up at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be achieved with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, adopted the cinematic and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer completes its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, retained his 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft, reaffirmed his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of size from 30 to 120 seats.
Until today, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, considers that more than 15% of its assets should be used to repay the 85 billion dollars that were charged to it.
AIG is willing to tax the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its life insurance at international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG might be segregated from are its aircraft leasing-Filiale International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of Transatlantic Holdings reinsurers, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT continues to explain.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG has to make sales as quickly as possible in order to repay the loans that it has granted to it over 85 billion, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the session Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives had turned down Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historical case of courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777,68 points to 10,365,45 points.
With regard to the points, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final rejection figures, the Nasdag index, mainly concerning technology, has dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to restore stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been beaten at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, the Members refused the funds he had requested to be given to the Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`A bad picture is circulated here, which makes Congress incapable of adopting a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market was counting on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days 'too late' will come.
`If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the US Central Bank, note d. red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would further limit the credit terms', Brian Bethune, chief economics at Global Insight warned.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, highlighting the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that passes away brings the ruin of a financial corporation to the United States'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to purchase the bank operations of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the markets face not only an American but a global crisis, the analyst of the FTN Financial added.
The market for basic consumer goods has grown strongly.
The government's revenue within ten years has fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and the revenue within 30 years of evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner of points in the first television dual
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday another followed to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, QGs announced their own victory in the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this television show, which was to be persecuted by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite impressive, was not 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published a poll on Saturday, which says that Obama has five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democracy clearly makes the better figure.
In the still undecided voters, i.e. those to whom it now comes, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, and thereby clearly stressing his opponent's 'neighbourliness' with regard to these issues, which were the focus of this first television dual.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge to become President', he also assured me.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican election spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being put out of the picture.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image of the United States’ world.
'McCain has still not understood, but Obama has already', this weekend opposed a democratic electoral campaign in which Republicans were accused of not recording the full extent of the crisis which is on the 'American side of the street'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama arranged for 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered on the occasion of an election in North Carolina in pouring rain.
He did not even mention the words 'middle' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage, which Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss.
`The coming week could be a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy, implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After once again stressing that he would even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, had the highest priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a 45-power plant by 2030.
The two candidates will carefully consider the questions raised in the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion euros (470 billion euros), which was adopted by the Congress last night and which is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Did you notice that a choice was made in Minsk?'
Young people and oppositionals demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling sites in Minsk's marketplace to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't even choose: 'What good is it if they do what they want to do with my voice,' says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the failure of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the raising of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
`We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census', regretted Juri Potemkin, the press spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition move to Parliament because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition thus owes itself to getting involved in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are not reforming, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which has been following the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It emphasises that the number of voters seems too high, and that the increase in voting time in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Did you notice that a election took place?' asked the leader of the social democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, namely those who most closely correspond to the government's views.
The silence of the night recedes over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulated on their success.
Discussion - From the blood that has been safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her founding, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, which had been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, during the 1980s, national blood reserves administered by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Canadian Government launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light into the circumstances which had led to such a tragedy and working out guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to report, several provinces then set up a committee to develop a new system for the administration of blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started working, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood-staining system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and by working in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before she proudly emphasizes that by the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps aware that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
`And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we called for one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which says that exclusion is applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresss only slowly, as it is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease is transmitted over the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution we used has quite a meaning.
In 1999 a much more precise technique for detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the virus to detect itself directly in the donor’s blood, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests previously used.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to reduce significantly the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV infected blood.
`In other words, it means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood preserves before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was transmitted via a blood preserve.
I think that today you can feel comfortable when you get a blood transfusion or write it to restore your health,' says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year has the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor continuously', Dr. Décary continues before stressing that Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient supply in addition to a secure supply.
`The need is rising because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood-supplier network, which accounts for only 3% of Quebec's blood-supplier population on average.
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the fitness criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who supply their blood are not expected to be ill with AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from the donation for one year.
`With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to hold it and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic nowadays that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation', Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood canned but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively in serious burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cord bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical waste, there is abundant blood from stem cells that can help treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the introduction of our thousands of cord blood samples, and we plan to reduce more than a thousand annually.
`We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', Dr. Décary further explains that this program describes the navel cord loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finals
Montreal's impact was second due to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders and decides the game of the quarter final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the U.S.L.'s first league.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half-time without goal for both the one and the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1 defeat in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-final, impact will be measured with the Vancouver whitecaps.
On Saturday evening Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in the back game in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the whitecaps nevertheless entered the semi-final round with a total gate ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The 1-trio of the Canadian team is ready to launch the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 win.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of the entire shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.'
`He's been too attached to it in the first half of the year, Guy Carbonneau remarked.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's partial elections.
`Move the course of our last large border to the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis yesterday, following all the guidelines.
During his lecture a kind of image mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power stations, mines, looked at from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds such as during the term of office.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused, by the way, to exclude him from holding the elections this autumn, even if he had been told that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely the 'new economic space', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned recently in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern part of the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the next projects.
At most some prospects for what more could be worked on: above all, water energy, the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest's census, the north has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice as large as France 'is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to achieve a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the North, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James book.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had put in a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec area, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always requested, declared its prime minister to the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a very long time if the opportunity is offered, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he said.
Moreover, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be habitable all year round due to the melting of ice.
In the face of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would deal with them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former expert member of Ungava), have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A Ministerial Committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Soil Treasures) took an important place, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which 'you will create a common vision'.
Furthermore, the development of the North will take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North Plan will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as being a continuation of the liberal prime minister who was in front of him.
Like the Liberals who were in front of us, we have been thinking about turning the challenges into new growth and development potentials.
By the way, this was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the conversion of Beauharnois' power plant to Adélard-Godbout dam.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who has reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James book, our party always knew how to determine the future', Jean Charest explained.
He addressed the press to another, this time conservative project, namely the `Roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the hydropower dam project Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest emphasises that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I intend to be there', he entrusted his party members with what prompted those applause storms.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding a election this autumn, which is possible from the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule is full, mainly because of a mission of the Council of Europe in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The Weekend General Assembly provided the Liberal Party Head with a platform of nationalistic plans, mainly from the 'constitutional objectives' which were adopted without further delay: the PLQ specifically calls for the recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto regarding the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord Plan were taken up with scepticism.
The head of Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the North-du-Quebec policy that the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to you, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, the government refused to apply it.
If she had done so, we would be much further today', Ms. Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
`But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea', the party leader Sébastien Proulx said in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - An Entrance to a Land
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (the irony) in the cabinet of Harper, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'damage' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration, so to speak, with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its countryman, imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things that are being accused of happening happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and causes a child soldier to wave away under inhumane conditions.
The only one who goes down to a court parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home to get him a fair trial in Canada.
This same government also closes its eyes to torture: they are little interested that a young adult after so many years of torment will certainly have been mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a hideous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly bears before himself like a flag, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
The time has therefore come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, according to the wishes of a head of government, who is still only supported by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what made up the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this discharge, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwell talk of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues, an orphan logic that the world's largest gold-winning company sought to open up a 'public transparent debate' of over six million against three authors and a small, mediocre publishing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slanderous complaints, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate to drive anyone into the ruin who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are often, moreover, to ruin the defenders in order to force a unanimous arrangement which causes the opposite side to die and also deter anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things in the public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, debates are usually held in Canada by exchanging ideas and not by knots.
It would therefore have been sufficient if the gold mine had disclosed its books and documents and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams, which could have brought this issue to light.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes off the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand move aside.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and, at the same time, ignore the opinions of this public?
In the world of Vice-President, this word apparently covers only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, slanderers themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she asks them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
She completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not please the rich company of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been known to deal with debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate charge of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what it presents, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified complaint.
Rescue Action for Wall Street Democrats and Republicans Understands
Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike finally reached agreement on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, over $700 billion, which is supposed to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two congresses.
The main elements are: better control of Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public money spent, new provisions to limit the number of houses occupied by redundancies, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to senior employees of the supported enterprises.
American financial secretary Henry Paulson, president of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republican in the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street', the democrat explained.
`This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous', declared Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect which would have had a renewed failure on investors' mood.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations very late, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction at the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on adding certain provisions to the agreement, especially those which should enable owners to keep their homes, and those which affect the salaries of the senior employees of the companies saved by the State.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibilities of certain people, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary, he explained on American television stations.
When he was asked on another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines that I have read show that this is one thing that we all need to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at making taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime), before it extended to other forms of widespread bonds (PCAA), and eventually to the freezing of financial power and to the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican MPs failed last week's first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of societies should only be secured by the government and not be bought, it is believed that the dead end will escape.
To round off the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added an option that states that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to retain its invested capital.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added, if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in the case of winnings and that can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of suspending the settlement procedures relating to the housing linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also to set deadlines for the repayment and settlements paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate to vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, there were other votes yesterday against this project, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'All obviously Washington doesn't understand us,' declared Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Finance Commission, his constituents.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to pay the check-in.'
Democrat Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucasian of Sceptics', shows things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent business professors, including three Nobel prizewinners, have written to inform us: We ask the Congress not to be put under pressure, and to think carefully about which way is going' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe again found that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank announced to Paribas that it would refrain from buying up its competitor who is in great difficulty since losing 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis due to risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, declared yesterday by the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
To offset this, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are coming to light.
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was about to put another bank in trouble from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
According to Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has had to government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Was the American actor free of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His delicate feeling, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have kept him from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a long-term runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more carefully in his acting, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the leap of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should come from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality.
After all, a whole country in love with the self-made man was reflected in the fighters who were injured in the war in the Pacific, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then went to the Actor's studio in New York before he had success at the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who became second in 1979 in the 24-hour race of Man, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a preface relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, engaged and hypersensitive star, whose mystery will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved the cinema lovers this weekend into twilight, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change moves with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) again pushes into memory, and the young man who returns his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to Die Katze on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will wake up a much shorter-backed memory (1990), which is disturbed by his sensitive Mr. Bridge at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, who was reintroduced after his death and who made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic ganov in The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and adorable billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
Still him.
==References====External links==
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several cinematographers who have retired early enough from the film world, Newman should remain in the saddle for a long time, thereby betraying Hollywood, his fortunes, his punk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles for a long time were just so attached.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, coward or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping off and his reticence.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his true sensitiveness.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian woman Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of sentiment and sadness.
In the flood of honours that took place yesterday about Newman, his close friend and former Armsman Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained: `His present has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's deportation, is now gone.
We may have seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was rather tasteless, even though we found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: "Always and to the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here."
And for us it was an honor to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory by supplement &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations in the criminal proceedings against Jáno's surcharge and his accomplices began.
In particular, the defendant is accused of participating in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent harm and commercial fraud, and other criminal acts, including counterfeiting of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds made out of the invitations to tender were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often filled with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly transferred to the funds of the organisation Fiatal Balloldal, partly to the private funds of individuals.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender fees were collected and the associations should not have complied with their obligations either.
According to the prosecutor's notice, a large part of the bills should have been falsified.
The invoice blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that tour north of Lake Platten, which was sent to István Lados by János supplement.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices on consumption in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as for Budapest's self-management later on.
These invoices are to be manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice András
One of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer room.
As two invoices issued by supplement and co in 2003 can be found, the catering company is to host the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the farm says that such a large group would not have suddenly entered the premises.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002, to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors of form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The imagination of the invoice counterfeiters was apparently not limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents do not appear at all at all to the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá according to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when the prosecutors sent him documents during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further: Apart from form defects, the fact was also wrong that the company must have accommodated one hundred people after having eleven rooms in total, which are impossible to accommodate.
Also mentioned on the bill was catering, the restaurant was no longer in service for a long time.
The responsible account counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they visited only offers travel abroad, and thus they have indicated Hungary's travel on the cash bill, which was also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As has been known in the course of the investigations, they also pointed to the invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are value added tax-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfühlink Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company was charged only 15 percent VAT instead of 25 percent, and only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another error that had failed the "accounting army" was that they had declared in a case "good transport" as performance, although this is not offered by the investment consulting company, the prosecution informed.
Further form errors - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be opened as forgery.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors claimed never to have issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" is the counterfeiting of the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület should have eaten there - the mass administrator thus indicated that the bills should not have been issued by itself.
Failed knowingly
The other group of accountants are those who were quite aware that they would have to settle fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Ballidal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at a level of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional invoices.
The biogate Kft currently in liquidation will also have worked with supplement and co.: In 2003 the GmbH will provide the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Stiftung, as well as the clubs Atlas Egyesület and Vorösfenyő Egyesület with fake invoices in total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to unsolicited services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which the parties concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not located there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of IT components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas has been a buyer of these invoices since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian company to which the company documents should also be delivered by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Cubatov has been able to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlas and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their counterparts themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian Maurren on Iván Kubatov's express request.
In fact, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he could benefit from the companies: At the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlas and Y-Generáció.
Overall, Cubatov has issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice sum as well as the VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were submitted to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but benefited from these amounts for non-profit purposes.
To hide this, they presented the TMA five fictitious invoices to the Works Team Kft..
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, a number of defendants have been charged with confessing the way in which the bill was falsified, as they had already been filed before the prosecution.
A sensation could be in case the main defendant Jáno's appeal results in a complete confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report extensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him on the recovery of the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether it is in return to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that strike now plays the "injured" after his attempts to soften the arrest and house arrest had run into deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage to economic criminals and have not paid them, are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The psychology of oversupply - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and therefore overvalue the fault bid.
Neurologists and business researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves to a competition, such as an eBay auction, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the others took part in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cortex, was measured in the event of the auction losing, in which the opponent’s excess played an important role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase was explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, economists in the research group have also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete with a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their contributions.
Another group was also promised 15 dollars reward, in case they come out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was merely that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "losing" playing group were prepared for higher stakes than those in the control or "winning" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, these have so far only caused the behaviour observed at auctions with the joy of winning, or of avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we have now prepared a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to seek medical advice
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated at a hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for various virus-induced infectious liver disease.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogens, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, cleavage or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to immunise the viruses A and B at least, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Then the yellow fever appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine darkens, and recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth is infected in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and cancers of the liver.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a dubious way - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more common: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
At present, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the hospital doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is known to be curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus banishing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the world day of hepatitis, which is the first time patient representations have been held worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do Believers Have Less Pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith acts like a kind of "pain" that should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent belief in God affects human pain, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 faithful and atheists received electric shocks each while studying a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
By brain scan technology, it was even possible to prove that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which scientists also participate philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University.
During the test, a sparking device was attached to the left hand, which the electric shocks gave off.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as reassuring.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during this time, while they should either look at the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "in security" at the sight of the mother of God as if they were "careful" and felt "rest and peace".
During viewing the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be brought to the atheists with other highly active images, one would have to find the corresponding picture.
"We would have to find an image that triggered very positive feelings, such as a mother or father," says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practifying the faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases too," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains as to what effect a Madonna image Leonardos or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the quality virgin Maria achieve even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the occasion of their tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it is in people's pockets as well as above their heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that's not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets them direct: These would just overlook the essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to come closer to the company's original goal, according to which she wanted to "order all information of this world".
Schmidt said that after ten years of work changing the world, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" but software programs are not yet able to answer because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search process and to use it later so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic also relies on the so-called "Recommendations", with which the system recommends custom-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which causes fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the reluctance to reject the power of many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A paradisaic example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "Orkut", and also enabled the pedophilia to be identified.
However, users concerned with personal rights could still breathe up in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully opposed the FBI before the court: hence, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully generated the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the Youth Protection Act adopted last year, but it has been effectively withheld for two months the list of individual users, or their web and search terms.)
Google's image thus remains controversial: those who are reluctant to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of the Google services are having to contend with the indignation due to the conservatively acting companies.
However, the American geek culture, which is present in many countries and is enthusiastic about computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, as opposed to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that in contrast to Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes from its users, and provides its services free of charge so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package appear to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the giant software.
On the other hand, the Geeks can see the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has been brought to the fore especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
For the "Web 2.0" is about nothing other than collaboration, saying that users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains to be shown publicly.
An average youth can manage his profile at the same time on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can provide blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove that when looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend will soon find out who has enjoyed her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released, because in his blog he only makes too honest his anger about the corporate management air - one thing is certain: the term "private sphere" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Anyone who leads an online life is what he says about himself - it's how you could spell out the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, deliberately does not leave any traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they are not inventable, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore also not generate the best possible profile from the user.
The public opinion, however, waits for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even facing IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly fast-implemented services cause not only Microsoft but also other software developers to break heads.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterparts: For example, the Group’s management has rejected an employee’s protest completely after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten were doubled, and the management said that the staff’s several meals were too expensive. However, all of this is quite mildly against the fact that Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed to an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal rules are that no new service will be applied for in advance, but only if they are already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could be strongly overturned: While some think that Google's book and magazine scan and archiving project is now taking on a number of dimensions that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database already gives the next generation of sci-fi authors the fabric - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best orwell manner a future in which a person, thanks to Google, becomes terrifyingly approachable.
Two young people are helping the double killer of Ózd to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of Ozd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped eliminate the traces, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
Young people have remained stable and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the news agency MTI, these are two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is strongly suspected of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigations, it became clear that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to 53 years.
The suspect, however, did not want to settle his debts, so he lured his creditor on a site in Ozd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon as well as the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers Sale for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, have offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stocks of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer the Poles had made despite the fact that they were formerly excluded from the Czechs as possible owner of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, who wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech daily "E15", the offer of Poland includes the highest purchase price so far, which was offered for the Prague Stock Exchange each.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Last week, Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said that the worst new owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be from all those interested, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their commentaries on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, on Tuesday, a number of leading European newspapers spoke of "second September".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said for instance "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to put his own party behind him for the draft law, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, threatens the danger that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy hangs in the air, precisely at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "Days Advertiser".
While some states might still be able to provide their savings to financial institutions, rescue packages could be made available to them, and banks could save the taxpayers’ money from the bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are neither more banks going, then no more financial shots, nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out of dwindling financial institutions, and the Viennese "The Standard" recalls. Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concerns were increasingly realistic that after the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to intervene a little deeper in their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis that is now sweeping like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "radars" would not have to be "turned" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to state in which case it would be reasonable to charge taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of bees.
At CEETEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln in the creation of new systems of accident prevention.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by Autobots, a mini-car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private" area, which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers picked up the idea of the laser-controlled distancer.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree field of vision within 2 metres, calculates their distances and transmits signals to the microprocessor on the board that immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of seconds, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the motion of bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If not, the Autobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Autobot Project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is currently considered inevitable within accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees when they avoid other bees.
And that must be done in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the deviation cannot be made down, or even diagonally - it can only be two dimensional, i.e. only in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While bees are endlessly open here to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use the autobot only the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous manoeuvres, so that it is currently just a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of heavy memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production in the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately guiding the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the active child
Now there is the written version of the 700-billion-dollar rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying bad bank loans.
Half of the money is to be spent during the first round.
In a meeting which ended on Saturday after midnight Local Time East Coast, Congressmen, after several days of debate, agreed on the 700 billion dollar rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the American parliament, and said that the agreement should only be put to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said the result: the program will have an impact and it will be efficient, but it will have to do even more. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the business out.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington's time Sunday evening 8:00 (Central European time Monday 2:00 a.m.) but has not triggered a high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday the House of Deputies will first vote on the 2008 draft law to stabilise the economy, then the Senate will be on the list.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and also the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
The program, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, according to which the $700 billion should be issued at once for the purchase of failed securities, with loans of burdened securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion being available immediately after the conference is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit defaulted, bad securities, and on the further USD 100 billion is to be decided by the President.
The programme shall be reviewed by a separate Commission which shall also be associated with the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another congress decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined approach: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-sucked securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As officials of the Ministry reported, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funding of concerns and pays the companies the fees due for the damage to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it be for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the in difficulty and now dependent on state aid banks can expect their disposals, called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas snake salopp, to be shortened by the government.
There will be a reduction in salaries only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that when the ministry purchases during an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed unless the senior bank manager is transferred to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the failed loans, the government will aggressively engage to ensure that the management salaries are not over-exploited.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be modified - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in management salaries are regulated by law, Dr. Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank get better.
The draft law provides for the president to make a proposal to Congress over the next five years to restore taxpayers' lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were advanced by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared with the previous month, compared with August 2007, by 12.9 per cent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than those in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to previous year's prices.
As a result of the price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only slightly increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also increased little - 0.1 per cent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly in bags and belts - an increase of 4.6 percent, while shoe prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices of chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
Price reductions were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In industry's major domestic markets, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have risen most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2-percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Price reductions were observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of the cost in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 percent.
In total, prices in manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Electricity, gas, steam and water prices rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
The highest price increase in the domestic sales market was recorded in August (0.7 percent) on the investment goods sector.
Prices rose by 0.3 per cent in the consumer goods production sectors, while they remained the same in the energy and further processing sectors compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16.8 percent compared to the 2007 comparative period).
In the consumer goods sectors, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was recorded, a price reduction of 1.4 per cent for fixed assets.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint rose by 1.1 per cent in August compared with the previous month, but there was an annual decrease of 3.9 per cent.
The domestic currency became 1.7 percent weaker compared to the euro, the dollar was 7.1 percent weaker, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it became 7.5 percent stronger compared to the euro, even 15.9 percent stronger in the dollar.
No more visa in the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister declared before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "all that depends now is whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in good time in overseas."
However, she also stressed that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy conducts negotiations in Washington from now on.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she also talks with foreign political advisers of the Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the $700 billion rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
The Congress and government representatives announced on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout package after days of marathon consultations.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, have become the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its advantage thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted away at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will quickly adopt the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also included those passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he told 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "obsolet".
In an interview given to the station ABC, McCain said: "We will all have difficulty (...) with that (...) but nothing is certainly no alternative".
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a Control Commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of top managers’ handouts - something that he had insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Deputies will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right bearing is intact, only the voters were more confident within the camp - so comments "The Mirror" about the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-hand German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's Revolution annihilates her fathers".
In the opinion of the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not come as a surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and has been among the fifty-cent mark for the first time since the 1950s
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, so still in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation carried out consistently by the CSU in the federal state has ultimately destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time it was very slow. But without any impact, the secularization, the educational success, the emergence of East and North Germans in the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain true to the CSU voters.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willed.
It is striking that, in recent weeks, the classical citizen groups have just expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a degree such as a university degree.
Here, the support of the CSU fell to just under 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tagezeitung reports in her "Who with whom? Party leaders withholding in coalition questions" article about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the incorporation of the SPÖ into internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly had them in their cards.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question as to whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP Chief of Vice-Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Meller course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or going to the coalition, is currently fully open, and these issues should be discussed within ÖVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which is being hosted by the EU Presidency country of France, has begun.
In her speech addressed to the Assembly, Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party, made the attention of Fidesz, particularly to education segregation, because this is one of the most serious violations that Roma children encounter, and this is also the main obstacle to their need to apply.
The High-Level Conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz, Járóka pointed out that, alongside discrimination in job search, Roma would be displaced from the labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education was a fundamental human right which played a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investments in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the Members of this House, it is important that these relationships become aware of as broad a circle as possible - Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated teaching must be stopped" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Members have said, a joint, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector, in order to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"We need to break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen," Járóka demanded.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the achievement of the objectives of equality of opportunity and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the electoral debacle, there are no heads at this time, at the top of the Bavarian CSU personnel debates have been postponed.
Party President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of vote is decided on the last October weekend at the extraordinary party day.
The much educated duo, however, had already seen that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to restrain the indignant group and the party base, which one day after the "bayarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career's top, the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. However, now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "single-parent" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of intra-party restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice President and Federal Minister for Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will conduct exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the "free electorate" in court.
An irony of fate is similar to the fact that with the list of "free voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-substantial appearances the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to serve the determined politician without mercy.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads from the background, will play an active role. On 28 September, the former Prime Minister and CSU President called the "best day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and hence to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint power act, Merkel cannot become a chancellor after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who, out of her disappointment at the Fiasko, did not make a noise, believes that the CSU's loss of terrain will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the social democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the Sunday elections no member of the opposition has made it to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is in the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent out 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
De Legislature of the 10-million-year-old resident state has come out without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposing party under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) has been seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who had already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in 2006 during the unsupervised elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment, would be "letting" some members of the opposition in Parliament this time.
That is why the ODS has even removed from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming economically increasingly dependent thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. In order to alleviate price increases, even loans were received, and the country has also agreed to divest the Beltransgas, the owner of the country-leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the light of the opposition's expectations, Ukraine was hoping to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other senior politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the political system that is anti-democratic.
The OECD's evaluation report, in which the emphasis was more on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections, provided temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report on Monday criticised the campaign - which is why oppositionals should not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
In spite of all this, the opposition is able to see a improvement in the political system: political prisoners were set free for instance, and Minsk is even prepared to face smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, has been considered independent for one month.
"We have made two steps forward and backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful are afraid of leaving only one oppositionist in Parliament".
The opposition does not intend to protest in the light of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have many problems to deal with here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of selling stones, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - Milinkevich pointed out that not even the most supported layer of pensioners is in agreement with the Lukashenko regime, the only merit of which is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's indebtedness and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" which is admonished to the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community Independent States, explained to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, and not the words." Therefore, the absence of opposition is a proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those sluices who first stamp off and then go for coffee during the working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Driving doors were a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," says Brunetta again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of the rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all those who cooperated on all sides".
All in all, there is now no breakfast during the working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Publica Amministazione)
in Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months, the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their pay dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large over the past 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta Decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the minister for the public service profiles himself with figures about lower reductions in work - so writes the Consumer Centre - the people of the 'real fools' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to explain war to the wrongful standards of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the ministerial renewal are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data from Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures illustrate the seriousness of a phenomenon which causes almost twice as many deaths as it is caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will commit the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data, disseminated by anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," affirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention at the workplace, to protect the injured workers, to support the families of the victims and to raise awareness of the public opinion".
"An indignant "basta" has stood up to this; understandablely, in the case of tragedies, which, measured by their scale, trigger some vortex in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
A special importance is attached to the numerous initiatives to become more directly aware of the school framework of young people who feed the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to divert attention from its social seriousness. One must put a legislative standard into effect and improve it.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "like the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data of the accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," emphasises President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes tragedy at the end."
"How do you believe that you are essentially doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight by various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already starting school."
"An additional effort is needed - so he adds - in terms of communication and awareness-raising of the public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is called for in relation to a phenomenon that is a social emergency".
Mercandelli also spoke about "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and addressed the "disposal of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to return a guarantee to the worker in order to ensure that the victim's fate of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided by a legislator on time."
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
Loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports, which cites the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU in a report published today in Brussels.
"From the report – as stated in a note – it becomes clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable musical devices for at least five years per week risk the permanent loss of their hearing for at least one hour a day."
"I'm worried that a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and cell phones on a high volume, will damage their hearing without knowing it irreversibly," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – that is to say, from the European Union – there is a clear risk that pushes for rapid action.
What really counts is to make consumers aware of and make this information common to people.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists - thus closing the EU communication - confirm that we are quite concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard, which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from excessive noise pollution.
These damages can be very limited, in which solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of noise exposure are addressed.
In her report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable music devices are only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) music is heard, so that the legal boundaries are already exceeded, the maximum noise level at the workplace applies.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10 % of the users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it will be over, in June balance will be drawn.
This is the course set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome. This morning, the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla-Thermen.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent, and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno stresses. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the City Council and the City Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will be reconstructed, as such a project must have a time-limited end point.
In June - as the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Anyone who doubts the Commission's competence, as it lacks a commitment which Alemanno says: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view of working seriously in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The mayor of Rome places great importance on clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will cost the Roman citizens no cent and it will bring us to think. It will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a high-quality leap – which it really needs – and thus to take a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal borders, but will look much further," not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, much to be considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States and who maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and still does this as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly fierce, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation who has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a great advantage.
Even in this case, there are people who talk to the heart and not to the head.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who will give his voice to the real American Patriot.
Here comes a mentality of the U.S. that has been kept up to the last hidden.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked what mistakes Bush made during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with one step in the butts.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists too: in the newspapers one can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern over the general credibility of the information concerning the persons concerned.
They don't feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is an economic model that was destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems come through the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the paper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – as the interviewed journalists do – if you want to prevent the traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive press seniors believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area there are even 65% executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are paving the way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest giant in American journalism is today between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of chief editors at national level are sure to share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
There are 30% of journalists.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", Note: Red.) is always a topical issue in the US.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers offer them as they like it and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, along with pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the thing is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they admit themselves, often become " sick" during the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BETWEEN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola on account of bank rot in the context of the anti-corruption investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a duty to stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (on which the prosecution had expressed itself) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and reach him indicting evidence.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This confirms the last edition of the New York Times, which tells of how the Republican party is going through the crisis, which is becoming increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast Seele, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "that in Washington" and the financial world and, above all, in the south and the centre of the states voters.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of what I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that announce the current economic earthquake or even already represent: not only in the United States, also throughout the West, and perhaps beyond these will be affected by these.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-afraid events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close links with abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of private households' assets living in a single state.
This is an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which is a huge electoral mass.
The crisis thus appears economically global, and politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been lost in itself and lost its right to speak: the clear evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, all are counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, among other things, the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to be saved without foreign aid.
And besides the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two unsurpassed prerequisites – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to rely in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that is most recently linked in the economy to a most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now that we have been so convinced that we have long since entered a connected whole kingdom, into a realm of ever differentiated technologies, the intangible, that we need to determine at once how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvesting and oil.
While they can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless extremely connected with a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, but which requires a brief shift in time.
If the territory, the government, who says politics, says so too, Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis appears to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over the existing guides, especially those of the economy, which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a profoundly rich and worrying aspect: a loss of trust, an impatience, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems to me that the conviction among large parts of the population is paving the way for it to be not only the actions of the social elite, but also their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as an ever more alien and superior.
The demand for Leadership thus subterranes a dispelled but powerful movement of the demise of the leading class and of the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unexpected "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden upheaval of the collective state of mind of recent times: beginning with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of American MEPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy here plays a role).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative of what is going on in the lower social strata of the West these days, and is still being pushed from the financial crisis to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superglue that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached the target.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers have succeeded in attaching a 100 kg body to a vertical wall.
STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-arranged pipes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic dunes, which give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the ability to hold the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "makes it easy to remove from the wall," said Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
TO MOURS ENTRY WATER? "This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Is it possible that the researchers think of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within the space sector.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a adhesive made of microfibres that cleanse themselves from dust by moving hair on a surface and thus maintain perfect liability.
Medicines: never take fruit juice
Take care of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these beverages by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with medication intake. During the 236th American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia, he again called for an alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice suffices to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines to the point of practically eliminating them and thus endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytics and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICAN MEASUREMENT – The same Agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients about the risks of this mixture in a report two years ago, stressing that what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT GREEPERRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, don’t have any shyness to ask a pharmacist or a doctor,” emphasises the Ansa Agency’ s expert.
Nobel Economic Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction, which received little polemics as an answer and was held to the economist years later, but today proved to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals in the context of Enron's or Worldcom's collapse has disappeared from public view," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software gains an ever greater number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration as free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some new features to the audience: in addition to a revised and now Spartan-designed start menu, one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system is finally reached, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007 was considered to be the case, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending by email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which expands the typical image of Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by multiple users, avoiding conflicts with changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a basket to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the definitive result is to be published.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if the freedom of the free will is an incentive for the distribution of the programme in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: after all, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even lacking a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opening business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the word matching text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims to push Excel; Impress, to create presentations like PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the more known access; and lastly Draw, a graphic module.
The aim for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a target that can easily be exceeded at already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also Kohl tested positively and hence the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case mi frame of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is a third-class and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver, who was tested positively on Cera, the third-generation Epo. Previously, this was already achieved by the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as by the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those carried out by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry in recent weeks.
If the countersamples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epoch, and, according to the Associated Press, also the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THE AMENDMENT: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKED: IS ITALIA RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of migrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with opposition.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the whole subject of racism in Italy and the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who is from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a pack of biscuits.
The case testifies to what the Times call "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where there is "most integration and work opportunities" and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refer to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and for the swifter expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underscores the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 Euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the latest study of the Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious moves. All the crowds of students lose their right to study as, in fact, their families are unable to support them at this height" – says Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the great demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of breaches: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rents.
For the Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures which, by revising the taxation, lead to lower rental prices.
When the study is examined in more detail, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping space in the district of Brianza is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the district of Bande Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the neighborhood of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the district of Vittoria.
In Florence a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate around the university in the neighborhoods, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of nuts, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who choose outdoor areas can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you will need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where renting for non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents above the average by 25-30% are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historic cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-saddle complexes in the periphery, in the long term means death for the single-saddle cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inviolable and irrevocable, but also carries the trains of a cultural crime.
Affected are mostly historical places full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom one has laid off a piece of road full of emotions," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably forever lost cinema world.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak clearly: over the past five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these certificates paid most of the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifies to the fact that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years Lombardy is leading the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all the preservation of the already existing, because closing a hall in the city, are not all his regular customers willing to visit instead of the old one multiplexkino in the periphery.
And here remains the missing bill for the fund of the trade union outside of eight: the debt burden recorded by the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be necessary".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided, because of fears about the old cinema halls, to protect it by means of an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax advantages for cinema operators and benefits for the public regarding local transport: it will be allowed to drive into the traffic restricted areas of the centre and also to park at less favourable parking fees.
"It is an enjoyable initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But certainly we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to set up something against the superpower of multiplex rooms, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "NUovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had played with the thought for ten years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The charges of the attorneys of the Antimafia authorities of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning in Mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the Clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also taken in handcuffs: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation sum of 10 million euros because of the involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Any kind of moral and legal standard disregarded," the lawyers wrote, "the two local authorities had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"The Mafia Group was thus made possible – as the judges said – by official means to enter the Councilhouses and to participate in public administration's policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "all but an exception to encounter connections between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically unavoidable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July with which, according to the police of the Clan Piromalli was decapitated.
Since the end of the last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and at that time due to alleged connections between organised crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Central Right Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He was interested in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, who accused him of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with the arrest warrant of this morning, explained that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
A hearing action in connection with the Dal Torrione case investigations has shown the willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the public administration's actions identical with the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the greats run up.
It is a non-sealing source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seems to understand the great energy companies of the world.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources on which now all look, and also seek to occupy, such as giants as Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years, and these studies have not increased significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke in about 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pressing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the worldwide energy demand could be met by ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy produced by nuclear power stations at the moment.
In addition, the currents and tides would be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are relying on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – according to the speaker of a company known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs the possibility of working with us."
This is about obtaining approval from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the Alaska coast.
This is not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil will continue to be promoted by the US in Alaska, and President Bush recently initiated the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are not known, but observers speak of an increasing interest.
Still worthy of improvement.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still emerging, not least because the last doubts have not been clarified by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which move the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers over pistons and cylinders.
This one drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The power is then sent via underwater pipelines to the coast.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot with the help of underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during the tides triggers the turbines, which feed through the resulting rotational movement of the generator.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Generation Research, a special interest is immediately deserving of the potential in the ages.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are planned for 2009.
