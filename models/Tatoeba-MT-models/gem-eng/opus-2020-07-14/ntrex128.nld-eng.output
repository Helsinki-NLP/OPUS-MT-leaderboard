Members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
A proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament) is in the hands of the members of the National Assembly of Wales.
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of several political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the Wales National Assembly of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘roughs on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for fools and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Wales National Assembly of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is 'satisfaction' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is 'open' for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short one.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently preparing legislation to carry out the name change, said: 'Of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves are taking the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the Wales National Assembly were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or ‘WMPs’, but the option MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus, and in a few weeks' time, she will have to submit a draft law on the changes.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
The members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when they debate legislation.
People of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday voters vote to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a pending dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on name change, has said that he will not take into account the results of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have difficulty
“The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a café and a church in every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today is neither a café nor a church to discover."
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
"People now have social contact in another way," he said.
‘Cafes are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly go by.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will go less long than the leaders expect, ‘and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining destinations of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will lead to these churches being closed even more quickly, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Father John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building suffered serious damage from fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a carpentry.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beekeeper 'the bells of the arms'.
The expert who played the carillon in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carpentry in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carpentry of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that Saint Martin's had not replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The Consistorium (the running body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote in July to express its concern that the diocese would "calculate the costs" to the council, although the council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishans complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark hurts 13-year-old who dives to lobsters in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who dived to lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday he had been hanging out with friends when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought the boy was yelling at first because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘that the boy was crying, ‘I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His collarbone was completely open,' Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
'I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!''.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be at risk of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told us in a press conference that a shark had been mocked a few weeks earlier in the area, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wish to break through on the British beauty market
Sainsburys competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and directs beauty departments in which specialized assistants work, such as in supermarkets.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove successful, they will be introduced in even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the racks where there were ever TVs, microwaves and interior items with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also the existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees gets more space, with per brand, such as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its boutique make-up back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers increasingly demand.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test out concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first one is previously opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second one will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will increasingly look like supermarket houses, now that the supermarket chain takes it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food has increased and the acquisitions have delivered more return.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his divisions Beauty and Pharmacy a makeover, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated when there was a conflict over the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago sold for an amount of 125 million British pounds to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxuries for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the layout of our beauty department, so it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands we offer for everyone some will, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million pound deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'enraged' because TV-presentator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old giftist announced on Instagram that she's leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, because she has recently withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “enraged” when Willoughby announced during a difficult meeting at the headquarters of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she did not keep enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories due to her new contracts (with a value of about one and a half million pounds).
The company is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune from an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would guarantee its future in the long term, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was lost when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrician, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now take on further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go on holiday together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British channel ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: 'We have no comment on his business affairs.'
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He wondered about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find 'unfortunately for a president', and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said,
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been under way.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'correspondent reaction' by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
Meanwhile, the United States continues its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results, and the missile tests have been completed, hostages have been liberated, and the material surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” said Trump, while he was to the audience before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population no longer lived, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international aid to be launched.
'Unfortunately, in many cases it is clear that they are not seeking international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain if the help providers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Emergency Response Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still in the process of evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to shelter at tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
The fact that there were no warning signs for tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal conditions it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital vessel in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the place of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's homeless infrastructure was one of the key elements of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government has to deal with a shortage of funding, and that while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also pressured by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are today following a previously conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge protected Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from the target of Chelsea, at the moment his team was standing at 1-0 behind.
He tapped left against the ball and then pushed towards the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the top right corner of the grid.
He invented the leap of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible,” said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and wading an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked at the ball.’
Chelsea was at rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The head of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, then he speeded through the middlefield to the half-player of Liverpool.
Kovacic did a quick one-two on the middlefield.
Then he gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty range.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15:00 in the group phase of the Champions League against Naples, in the stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea competes in the UEFA Europa League against Videoton on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll of tsunami in Indonesia amounts to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the National Emergency Response Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 of last Friday, with waves of 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is filled with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old male suspects in murder after a woman has been stabbed to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 at Grayson Mews in John Street, where the body showed stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspecting murder.
The police ask local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has only just begun, but I want to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen something suspicious or heard to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something via a dashboard, because they can have information that is essential to our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman on site came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one in or out of the building can.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying at the scene.
She just keeps repeating, "What a shame!".
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were within the perimeter, and a third was just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents were watching the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or anonymous contact with Crimestoppers on the number 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the rewriting history-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-nightly destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical purite followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Dr. Crick as 'dwaas' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the display of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many believe still needs recognition.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Murderous pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the last name ‘Yuan’ is known, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was pierced and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the infestation of pigs in a pig stable on 30 May 2005, in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have left Yunnan's neighboring province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to be a door to a neighboring pig stable.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on its mouth was found in the pig's nest.
According to the report, a forensic study showed that the 250 kg pig killed the farmer.
'The legs of my cousin were blooded and maimed', said the cousin with the last name 'Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal the man killed wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
One market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the others from attacking, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It is said that the Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It happens only rarely, but there have been cases of pigs that attack people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
‘They’re just games.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not ready to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The star of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weak now that she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring severe rain to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 o'clock local time on Sunday morning and 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to ascend north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, which moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the South West in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, floods and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can engulf wild rivers, and storm will produce windflake and dust locally.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the southern California coastline.
There is a 1.5 cm rain possible, which could lead to small ruins and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will be more spread at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, because the Arctic is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the US, it is expected that October will start warm, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can become 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the opportunity to reach mid-October is high at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks on Thursday for the touching testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaughh was mutilating her and tried to strip her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a crazy testimony that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have looked at Friday.
The company counted the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
In comparison, that's about like a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar show.
Fox News Channel, which gives all the support of Kavanaugh's appointment, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that protesters shouted to him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with his eyes knocked down while he was being insulted, live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
‘Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone said, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the hearing.
The various stations sent everything live out when the judicial committee had to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate hours later.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the police by the following week, something that the Democrats urge the minority to do.
Among other things, Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May blamed politicians who were critical of their plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson highlighted his attack on his so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, and said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect charges was 'absurd'.
Shooting game Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and in prison for murder, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is fixed at 350,000 dollars, reports the Advocate.
The coroner of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published on Friday a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police’s Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘intervention and pursuit of justice.’
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He won an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match in the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU-Basketballcoach Will Wade said that the team was 'capot' and 'in shock' by Waydes dead.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” says Wade.
Volcano spits ass on Mexico City
The ashes spewed out by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after an activity had been picked up in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions had been registered for a period of 24 hours.
The center detected multiple rumps and vibrations.
On social media, pictures of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 hit the Richter Central Mexico scale.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded in beating up the riot police, while thousands of participants took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the riot police bombarded the agents with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds to ignite in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, the police broke out with the police, and the cops pulled their bats up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for slight injuries they suffered during protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise in the region of independence, one year after the 1 October referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters were overwhelmingly in favour of becoming independent, although the rise was low and the people who were against dismissal were boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in the polling offices in the region, where it resulted in violent blackouts.
Pro-independence groups had camped the night of Friday on Saturday on the spot to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied his wife with the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hoping for the prospect of becoming independent.
‘Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was nipt, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. Many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity pending a trial about their role in organising the referendum and proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in provisional detention since last year, declared that he was taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
'A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,' he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after home was framed with a car
Three men from 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeatedly framed in a Londonderry house.
The incident took place on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves had suffered damage.
Maybe at some point a crossbow has also been fired on the car.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The acclaimed Livingston surprised the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt came to be equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not succeed in this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to record Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points ahead of them.
But first the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston has now won six consecutive games in his department, and Coach Holt hasn't suffered any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
The Holt team had long been able to achieve a lead for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing it with a goal point, and then Alan Lithgow, who took up Craig Halkett's baseball, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team had the Rangers play with pleasure, waiting for his opportunities to be quiet and confident.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty range.
At the time, the Rangers had a lot of ball possession, but the defense of the home team was unmistakable and goalman Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goalman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a proposal from his colleagues at Livingston.
There were constant efforts to reach the penalty range of Livingston, but they were each rejected. Twice a penalty blow was refused, one after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenonal' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played without exception excellent and continue to surpass expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he's swept up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not break through.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed once to scale the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went on Saturday (29 September) breakfast together in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurden, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 p.m. local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident involving a plane crash on Childreners Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said cops were in the process of identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six chipiers injured in order disturbance
Six cipiers have been injured in a violation of order in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 p.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ cipiers have been deployed to resolve the situation involving eight prisoners in one department.
The cipiers were treated there for slight facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: ‘Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a topical incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners live, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October the riot police were called to prison for a serious disorder of order in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potentially positive effects on drought zones)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert, which carries risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden flooding for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday night it will rain already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the South West is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are identified, slightly more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category,' reported weather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa is still on hurricane strength at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located at 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, weakening them.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, resulting in a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” said weather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then pass late on Tuesday evening through Arizona and in the south of Utah.
‘The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teen was injured on Saturday at about 4 o'clock local time in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stability'.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area at night, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has suffered from the meanness, anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh 'continued to be in common, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday and denied powerful and emotional the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford has also witnessed her accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people’ saw the magnificent and incredible character, the quality and courage’ of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent status of service,’ he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
‘In five weeks, one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
I'm not participating, but I'm actually participating," he said.
"That's why I stand for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said that the Democrats are on a mission to 'resist and hinder us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, said a top member of the GOP Executive Board to CNN.
Hundreds dead by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many being wiped off the ground when gigantic waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met on Friday for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu, when waves of about six meters high hit the land at the time it started to shimmer. Many people fell to pieces and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not immediately run away and thus became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for assistance in natural disasters BNP during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land,' Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On aerial photographs released by the Natural Disaster Help Office is shown that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city was shaken by shocks.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the huge Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the city's geography, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has enlarged the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organization got a lot of criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, you can hear a man yelling down on the top floor of a building in panic to people on the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters could not immediately verify the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power disruption that cut off the communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue attempts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with auxiliary goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuations are still in urgent need of food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for assistance and has been closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami dodentol rises above 800.
It's very bad.
True, World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office search shelters in tents of deck, but passed along scenes of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups with the difficult mission started to launch emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign relief workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be authorised if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
'It's still a provincial disaster,' said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
'Once the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.'
When the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and relatives of the missing ones continued to hope that they would find their loved ones their life back, as in the miracles that people so much like in the event of terrible natural disasters like this one.
On Saturday a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers freed a woman who had spent two days under the rubble with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subando, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandadi.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate whatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his reports, however, only one grey spot appeared instead of two blue spots.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM supplies in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning steel thieves $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Professor Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was working, another man ran from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many persons were involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact Newport Police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a short time and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the maker of the show.
You are not just an abbreviation of his present artist name. Earlier West already told him that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'', said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, we are.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, has worked with and without the link sign and the capitals.
Mexican President promises no use of force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians. The country stands on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would ‘never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. Left student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
United States must double the funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research of A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all of Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements of A.I. that come from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030 the country wants the number 1 to be in the field of A.I. innovations.
'The budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next break in A.I.' said Lee.
A doubling of funding may lead to a doubling of the chances of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player in American Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next match would take place, because it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the USA researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
"China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting the best universities to work on A.I. in recent years.
Lee said that US efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
'He who is a doctor in the field of A.I. should be offered a green card automatically', he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Sciences Foundation provides financial support to academic staff, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry and academic partners in the initiative, and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that 2 billion dollars would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than 100 million dollars in research into A.I.
However, US legislation that should lead to the creation of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in jeopardy for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country’s name to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’, thereby resolving a dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and would no longer hinder Greece’s Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims on Greek territory, so Greece vetoed Macedonia's inclusion in the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: ‘Do you support NATO membership and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Name change advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that originated when the former Yugoslavia disjoined.
'I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it will lead to a safer life for all of us,' said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the results, which will determine them.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be required to change the name.
The National Election Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
At the time, however, the rise was only 16%, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters came to vote.
‘I’m coming to vote because it’s important to my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an electorate in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum around the country's change of name that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
Before Parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a back door,’ said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership of NATO will generate much needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority are in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another survey, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70% would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, then the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came into power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City Passes Full Defense of Brighton and Scort
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short mats with the defense of Brighton at Etihad Stadium in English Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2 to 0.
It looked like a whistle of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peaks were first played in the middlefield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, put the open field in.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton's penal range.
Then he gave a passport to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat goalman Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right-hand side of the net.
'Aguero has problems with his feet,' said Coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was in the field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful ski pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball and sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tapped the ball just before he was too far.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 am on Tuesday. The competition will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was little reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are any consequences to the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They currently stand for one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least obtained a game card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do all they can to secure their first section title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team probably plays at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to set Scherzer up as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was standing in the injection field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington stands on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organized a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
‘Everything we have already accomplished is at stake in November.
In five weeks one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't participate, but actually I do participate. That's why I stand for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back, no matter what they need to do for it.
It doesn't matter to them who hurts, who they have to push away to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'resist and hinder us'.
'And we've seen that for the past four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'boasted and mean and false and lying'.
He named the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud appeal from the public.
‘Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who were told that we were not welcome, just because we were saying what we were thinking.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished by the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough issues similar to those of earlier leaders, such as those in which Jeremy did not agree.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
And that was the case during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I have already been a local Labour parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a 'kinder, softer' policy, once it has already begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether or not it is acceptable to the Party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, colleges who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I, suddenly expected me to reverse and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are social media abuse parties calling for my candidacy to be rejected as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who each day have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that very bad parties are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every 'motion of distrust' or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
For the past two years, I have often received the advice to keep myself low, not just to express my opinion loudly, and then I would 'don't get in trouble'.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since 32 years ago when I became a schoolchild member of Labour, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as councillor and in my role as minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
I can only say one thing to those who have promoted the motion on Friday: when the country proceeds to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate as a parliamentarian for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have pulled the end result somewhat crooked, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphs rightly in this wonderful game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the classification, the only unbeatable team of the ten.
Eventually it was both their superior defense and their better chances of winning the home team, and coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied.
"We've had a lot of trouble in our competitions so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I'm a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we do.’
Grant Anderson's strike in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card by Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors competition), Melrose was able to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking down a fight.
With a penalty, Climo created an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solo drive just for the rest. So it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's strike, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The competition stopped for a long time before a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on a Brancard, and as soon as the game was relaunched, Ayr could continue to run through a plot of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card from Ayr, and again counted Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed a trick by Bruce Colvine at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he was hitting Climo without the ball, MacPherson made a touch-down on the penalty-line-out behind the uplifting Ayr-maul.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe kicked the box kick from David Armstrong up and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran is going from Still Game to the restaurant. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kühr is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun let shine through that Kühr was looking for a way to participate in the 'flowering restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': it hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean.

On all the marine bases from Titicacamera to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline that the country had to give to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century conflict of raw materials is still lively, just as the desire to preserve the Pacific once again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in the last decade, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be discussed on 1 October after five years.
'Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and naturally looks forward to the result', said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the Court's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will argue in favour of Bolivia that Chile is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea after decades of heated talks.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is next year for a controversial struggle for re-election, is also very much at stake in Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if it did, there would be little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands is not competent to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the ruling of the International Court of Justice only falls six months after the final plea.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have become worse over the past four years.
'The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,' said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile might have had to completely undermine, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to continue to talk after this.
The two countries have not had ambassadors in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have ‘an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘end 139 years of disagreement, with mutual benefits’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
'Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific,' he added.
'The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us.'
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can be trusted by the US
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust it.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo was about to start the ongoing nuclear diplomacy again, more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a "utopia" that the ongoing sanctions and the American objection to a statement that will end the Korean war will ever get on the knees of North Korea.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit meeting.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says that he would refrain from an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon to buy from you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were this summer not to think away from Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gemstones, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks the lips were sewn together. They looked more on Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream.
And if you want to follow this daring fashion, you're lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-metre-wide rim that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media, also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bathing suit that the bag included.
The roodoranje raffia bag, cut off with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather pendant, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMIIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent position in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects outstanding within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relations and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score.
Data collected from 74 schools in SCIS show that 72 per cent of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent of students in French and 63 per cent of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as professionally as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling in job vacancies were attributed to a lack of linguistic knowledge, according to employers.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future career.
Now that more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation. French was the only language that surpassed the 10% peak, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look ahead to 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are working to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this needs to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

LeBron makes his debut on Sunday at Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening competition before the season.
We still have to determine how many minutes he'll play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six pre-season matches.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any races before the season to prepare for me,” he said.
Period of election rally of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallyes
It is the first of five scheduled rallyes of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that are near him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he prefers to be held in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time does the Trump rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 hrs.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh of this week, which were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallyes is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more emanating.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallyes in the following week are intended to 'encourage volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Deputies', Reuters says.
‘Control of Congress is so important to his program that the president travels to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins’, said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh's media, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state that he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating sling of opportunities is a fully invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who gets the best chance at the moment?
'They first had a six-point lead, and now that's only four more, so we find it so little that happiness is on our side at the moment,' said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of standing four points in front of it, while there are twelve more in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four have scored.
Spieth has been a fearless opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial well with which match four became a success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two games.
His well with which she won the competition on 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes that the American team is not yet defeated.
'You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game' said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but wonderful European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that played no bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audiences, they are the players who have to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who wins a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short mats with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede that they could no longer overcome.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help to catch up with you.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
The European team has already played its best so far and has a great advantage in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to engage in the fight, something that some people, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts off with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they stand with 10-6 on the United States.
It won the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, thus now having four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blaming Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could no longer catch up.
Jim Furik's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles races of Sunday in order to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname 'Molliwood', after a sensational weekend, are but the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After entering the four-balls, Woods and Patrick Reed were beautifully played together and beat a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5/4.
Woods, who slid himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka, the number one and three of the world, with 2/51.
Yet it did not run off a leash for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2/11 by the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4/3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furik has enough to match, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it 'in no case' will disarm unilaterally without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the constant sanctions would lead to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ‘important goodwill measures’ over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see a corresponding US response," he said.
'Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will by no means unilaterally disarm ourselves.'
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'phased' approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as the further steps take, it occurred that he did not reject unilateral denomination as a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the 'denucification of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed appeals to ease the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'denomination first' and increases pressure through sanctions to reach its goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'explanation of the end of war', Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which the American leader had previously held at the United Nations during the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party were not the US and the South Korea, the denuclarity of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
However, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be directed to the mainland of America so that after 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim this year with the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denucates.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time schedule for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.’
China and Russia agree that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue forcefully and decisively until we have achieved the full, final, verified denuclarity.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has carried out unanimous sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he was going back to Pyongyang next month to make preparations for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not going well.
Nearly a few hours after leaving Pyongyang in July and saying that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of setting 'walking star-like demands'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take 'similar measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink lots of caffeine.
One professor noted that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the U.S.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a talk about the influence of lack of learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, 'Why can't I just hear this in my last year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services of the university, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when going to bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With the help of a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of the choice for cigarettes on their health, added Czeisler.
He says that studying the culture of joy at night still exists, and because of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep shortages are an ever-increasing problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep, of good quality, the student's 'secret weapon' must be to combat stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortages cause the brain to give them a constant hunger feeling.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course. He had taken lessons last year with the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to stand up. They must also be aware of the damaging effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythm, which may make you have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to lower Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their competition again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a competition since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but the team of Gary Holt led the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 games. His team now has eight points left on Hearts, which continue to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now dropped to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitors team supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They passed Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleventh place for Livingston, which the Hearts knew to cut off a point last week. He would have been thrilled by the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at each move.
The Rangers may have had most ball possession, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga gave out the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the violin, but the middle field couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached Commander Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow pushed against the rear pole.
The Rangers did succeed in taking control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found at least that he was entitled to a penalty blow when he and Steven Lawless crashed after a quarter of an hour, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers could shoot only twice to the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was formerly a target at the Ibrox, was able to stop Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's tamme shot with ease.
The opening of Livingston in the 34th minute should not be in the extension of the general game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even though it was only for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers had not met Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher handed over the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who stepped the ball into the target with ease.
Gerrard made a break with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent exchange. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston likes, where Lithgow and Halkett keep kicking long balls.
The Holt team could have increased its lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor was well standing and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came far from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the game for a penalty blow after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom TELLEN can well ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called geiger counter.
The violin counter has since not been to think away from science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the first view of unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘That’s a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this main phone, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!’
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise malignant cells in the framework of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to modify them in a laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which is often present in all types of cancer. Then the cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a highly promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of various types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to treat cancer cells has already been shown to be effective in treating a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West cuts off pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That wasn't as he had hoped.
Kanye West was released during a show of Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he became a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he dropped a tirate against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Many times when I’m talking to a white person, she asks, ‘How can you be sympathetic to Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been out of America for a long time,' he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stuck the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate committee on the alleged assault on which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The West tirade was not broadcast, but comedy Chris Rock uploaded it on social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his mail wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained to the audience that he had been taken backstage under fire for his hat.
‘They have trodden me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on stage with that hat."
They teased me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?’ He said he would attract them superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience there was at least two appeals and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by an audience: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was guest as last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest minds: APPROACH THAT YOU MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talkshow-presentary Karen Hunter tweet that West was just ‘normal itself, and that's beautiful.'
‘But I choose not to reward anyone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too, added them.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on he is, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was led by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg also has the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then in The artist formally known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder after partying in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.

The defendant is expected to appear on Monday before the judge in Belfast.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington exclaims toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy realm Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out to the macho hero's stereotype and says that when young boys watch such roles on the screen, they often think they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he found that 'there was something wrong' and he asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me at the moment: where has it gone wrong with our masculinity?" he said.
"What did we learn from men when they grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television might be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood, due to its very male characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is taught?"
What is learned on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
For something has clearly gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series next summer is over, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
Since November, Kit will be playing in a rematch of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is an attacker.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that way I've kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was previously not so.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people who thus rise HIV is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
According to studies, due to the conservative values of land, 70 to 90% of men having sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted through insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication since 2003 in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and exclaims 'dangerous lies' and 'complot theories'
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters opposes the allegations that one of her staff staff member has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the allegations are spread by 'extremely right' contentions and websites.
'Sacred lies, lies and even more nasty lies', Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill at a hearing of the Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge of the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The Waters statement quickly came across criticism online, including by former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry', wrote Fleischer.
‘You can find out from this that she does not have the temperament to be Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger at the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Very, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations.
'We will make the perpetrators known,' she said, 'and they will be legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.'
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In each new film with a British impact we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that turns out to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a weak spy in the lead role, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was reborn in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy selfate about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with his eyes peeling off and flexible facial features manages to send everything in a hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can conclude that he is a common comic character that was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a touch of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everybody has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tick against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor comes rather weak over and crazy enough, especially now that the "serious" series of films like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and that does well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and Johnny English's plight comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the text of the character Bean that plays Atkinson.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain known, to the great horror of the agent in function, a sad little role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that makes the bucket overflow of the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must use a retired spy as each active spy is compromised.
And that means the Stuttering Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but gives unofficial lessons about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spy boys of English make something of school or rock.
English is quickly offered at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic help Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's hemorrhage femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start from their odyssey of witty silly fun: dressed as a waiter, they set fire to a glamorous French restaurant, they cheer up on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English unleashed pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with Volta's interior.
For that last one, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-meaning and turbulent the scene is, it does something about child television.
It's all not very original.
And like other films by Johnny English, I wonder: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is thinking of a plan in which British people work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party would consider a radical plan in which British workers work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
It is said that the party would want companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea 'fits' in the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country's balance sheet reflect in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Trade Union of Trade Unions, which is a good way of ensuring that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one moment to another, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits into the party's endeavour to make the balance in the economy more beneficial to workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the efforts are not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said, "A four-day working week is not a party's policy plan and is not considered by the party either."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour's conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'secular drivers' and the 'profits' at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to regain the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'reductions' on the basis of perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there were plans to include employees in the boards of management of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) to allocate 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees who could earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their mind.
The investigation by the FBI into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week delayed and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcasted on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley to Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be wall fast.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I do not see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up to stars will take place and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
Concertgoers who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, a world leader e-mailing, a phone call or in another significant way generate awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, going for another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand action or is this just another form of 'clicktivism', people feel that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million 'actions' from supporters, which were aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 initiatives and declarations based on the actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realise their full potential'. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after sending more than 5,000 actions asking the UK government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced that it would support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children would achieve with food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website which was asked "why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
said the group: "It will be a long and difficult road, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and anti-separity movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing this year at the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to impede Russian exports of energy - Home Secretary of State
Washington can 'if necessary' take refuge in the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the staff member, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinc spoke for those invited during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that deflects itself as the 'voice of the energy consumption' in the US.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ significantly.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that only knows an 'art', with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the government of Trump is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, while replacing Russia, a country that offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its view from the 'inappropriate' Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trom van Berlin, has made the 'captive' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, will double current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The American position has prompted a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously about it" to take part in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she was "serious about thinking about it" to take part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to repair the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll seriously think about it in order to make myself elected president."
Warren fought against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said that he "set this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and of Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for the FBI to investigate before we vote on this."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren's own support felt that it should not be elected by 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand for election, according to a poll of the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent was for her to stand up for election.
The study showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with a possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS from Track Palin at Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he took up service in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son has to experience, what he's going through when he's back, I understand other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers return," she told the audience who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and get harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the homeland".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new U.S. policy which refuses asylum to victims who are on the run for violence from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement last Friday as 'Friend of the Court' to Washington's court in support of an asylum seeker who contests this policy, NBC reports News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's been arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people from the United States are applying for asylum, as countries who have major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The US's new asylum policy has reversed a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents who are on the run for domestic violence to ask for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "regards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" stated by the "Friend of the Court".
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US harms the economy of the US, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary workers'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges to give no more asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief," says Sessions in his announcement of 11 June of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to do all over the world every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse and worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their devastated homes and searched for valuable goods they could still use in their sleep.
Hundreds of people have suffered injury and the hospitals are overpopulated, insofar as they have not been damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris who had a fractured back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe post-shocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added when he was with his family in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted an advertisement of four pages in an American daily, inviting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the China Daily annex in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the U.S. Congress elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, where they have imposed ever higher import rates on each other.
China's early trade war reimbursement rates were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states such as Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "doubts the intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long-kept tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast to a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find different voices in vain and you will not see any real reflection of the differing opinions of the Chinese population on the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumbs of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," as he did not say in which newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh-debacle, the Republicans alienated female voters just before the mid-term elections, warn analysts
Now many important Republicans are around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will suffer a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this subject have been enormous and most Republicans have already informed that they wish to continue voting.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republicein, Arizona) to plead for an FBI investigation at the last moment would be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they haven't forgotten tomorrow and they didn't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and country spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington Newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, on the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can continue, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the President".
Even for the public testimony of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate before the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans printed the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or Kavanaugh's taking place in court, but also about how the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, makes clear to the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided over the question of who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, where a small majority stand before the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony, whether or not it is likely that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was sure or likely lying during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford announced last week to the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown his genitalia to her at a party in the time they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee explained that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored in it.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to any information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to engage with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will put all their business models on their heads at once".
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium that was published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also be established as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after the start of Inrupt.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual and bearer of the Victoria Cross from WHO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War is honored as a military 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, Honorary Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglisse and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, so he never knew that the highest British military honor had fallen to him.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918, over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns".
He later stormed to the fire line and led the line forward before running to a field shelter alone and shut down three members of the strikement.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never type into, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann have also laid a cliff after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very venerated to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and received Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed up all night watching a full-bodied Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
The San Jose bill featured 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., right at the time that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed up all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no more content should be displayed that is not suitable for children, and that is why we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yesss."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom are also given a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the return competition, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of text messages going up and down and believing me, these weren't all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic freshman Tom Daley says that he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual nature, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Lavorne he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that the parent had contributed to his inferiority to winning at the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months off because of illness.
Apparently as a shifter on Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day are those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," so he wouldn't let people down if they finally found out about his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become an outstanding campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised me'.
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much so young," he participated in his first Olympic Games at fourteen years of age and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if she had already received the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stung and he died, I could finally acknowledge that he was not invincible," he said.

"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had attacked him heavily on his way to the games and that he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in form, at the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will establish a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must see his form back to not make a sad milestone of it.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising on the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it is about.
Because even on the peak of his career he was never known for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs is punishing the straying balls routinely.
And if the job itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will come in the ninth match on Sunday the always Accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches start well, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, although he could honestly find it difficult to change.
"He completely understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, hit his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I expected more, but it's the way it is and it's the way we've been supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mikkelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain inestimable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to joke with people, and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him every now and then last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advantage before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made his debut in the race in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just now," Bjorn, called here, after seeing the lights of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for an advantage of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make full use of it tomorrow.
Get on the move and implement the plan to the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is this trophy winning, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be ahead of things in this area.
Tomorrow another challenge awaits.
Tomorrow the individual performances will be discussed, and that is a very different discipline.
It's great to be out there running with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone, your capabilities as a golfer are only really being tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Fury himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try well to start, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have adjusted our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order that is best according to us and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat to wizard tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany is being delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014 to replace the outdated warships of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newsmagazine Die Zeit that a military spokesman quotes.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 serve to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of air-rescue and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put the latest frigates together for up to two years, far from home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The fatal frigate F125 had already taken the newspaper heads last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known of the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from severe overweight, which will reduce its performance and limit its capabilities to further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the full project, including the training of the crew, will also become a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frigates have in their grip are becoming particularly important because of recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the marine actually has "a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said that the problem over time has grown as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of operation but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available for admission to the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a farm in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large ear bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the screams of the bat and what kind does.
Next, a map of the habitat and a report is produced to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show which areas of the habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning may also pose a risk, as may fly trappers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and house cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
Their nightly hunting habits, however, make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares ashore in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who carry out regular examinations, inspection of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reservation for bats in Scotland at the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threeave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats not yet known and therefore the work we do here and at other locations will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of controlling bats before maintenance operations are carried out, since the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boy, possibly eliminating a complete local population.
Bats are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall or to disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo's accusations of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The summit of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the assault of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live called Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the subject.
I'm a happy man, and by and by and by," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called 'an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident occurred allegedly in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, returned to the footballer's room, where he raped her anal according to the charge, as can be seen in the charge filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a '99 percent' good guy, but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'afraid of the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to declare the scheme invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left this summer to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will have regrets forever' as car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom will 'have regrets forever' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'careful' that Toyota UK had said against the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit jobs would cost.
Last year's factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production cease in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automotive products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already indicated that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns the car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the delivery chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
The production line of Toyota runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, where every 37 minutes parts arrive at suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be unrest at the boundaries that the industry believes can lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, so let the company know, and therefore in that case the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly tailored to avoid border controls'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to go on with these very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitiveness and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the trade union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back again.
A public spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's encounter can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney-general Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'for another week' while the fight continues over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possible obstruction of the presidential court.
The question whether Trump is going to dismiss the Deputy Attorney-General and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been going on for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to capture conversations with Trump and to dismiss the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors made the round that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then held at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he didn't like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the press director of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein she said: "There is no date for it, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, considering all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters were struggling with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences was not caused by a reluctance of the 'wonderful' TV journalists, however, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President makes more questions and responses than any president for him," she said, without proving this, "we've looked at the figures."
Press conferences are still going to take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the President are rare.
In New York this week the president demonstrated why, he made a frank and bizarre appearance to the collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter about Brexit to employees of NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue to work with the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have already declared their willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also lifted preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
I would therefore like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and that provide benefits to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers line-up, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he suffered a head injury in the 31-27 game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly in peace.
"He came to the sideline and fell more or less," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline, before they put him on a stretcher and took him along for further research.
A staff member of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details about the type/size of injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was picked up five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making it 18 times a total of this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher tolls when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher emptys when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in losses is levied on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £ 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher emptys when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds are used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this to multi-precious people.
The increase in the emptys is levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenue being added to a government effort to combat homeless people.
The premium, which comes on top of the current empty space, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, may amount to up to three percent.
In this way, the Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £ 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the house ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become virtually 'spoken cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction of the emptys to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it and he called May to abolish quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'household shame' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister to restore the British Dream, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of having a house has ever become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over the head has become too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is Scotland's management"
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his "ultimate ambition" to ever become a manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reliving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently third in League One, on three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership the previous season of St Mirren.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and with that the vote was off," Ross told Sports Sound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw that I often play in Hampden Park with my father Scotland and it's something that keeps attracting me.
But that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, he had previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me is being measured by 'can I have this club returned to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from graduation to the third division and has transformed St Mirren from on the edge of graduation to winning the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crucifix" he remembered the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did pretty well, I earned pretty well and knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're being confronted with every week.
I still have that, considering the stress and pressure of the subject, but management just feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The summer heat wave has increased the income of British pubs who have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenue in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, which collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and the fact that England was more than expected to participate in the world championships meant that July showed a similar pattern than in June, when pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were getting even harder.
The 1.8 percent fall in the turnover of restaurants in June, only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at selling drinks performed by far the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food members also of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drink sales were 6.6% higher for the month, while food turnover was 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results have continued the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the outing market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8% turnover year-on-year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators focusing on food and only the time will learn if the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary replenishment."
Total sales growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years of age, makes accounts for social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager there who asked others to 'rap her'.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistressesses" Conference) of independent schools, found that 40% of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is alarming that so many teenagers are attracted to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish council for athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will profit enormously from her election in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help run the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly makes comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn or I will recover and to what extent.
It has been very hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
Advice for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, splits online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an advertisement in which nursing mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most quiet portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has released an ironic, music video inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to choking mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see anything about it' and 'In case you didn't watch it, these aren't udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus continues with: "Pumping, pumping, pumping, feeding the babies, pumping, pumping, pumping, milking the lady's."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has directly ensured an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the dairy industry's 'horror' is condoned in this.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be expected to grow milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of delivery" is written in a response.
The breast pump of Elvie fits discreetly into a nutritious conditioner (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarious'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't looked too much for it.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are choking (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then have the feeling of being just 'kids'.
This advertisement does not appear to be positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are choking sometimes feel just cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly in a nutritious condition, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on batting.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing choking mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to place the coal and the associated challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of imprisoned migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged in the month, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid of their own chance of continuing to endanger the country by registering for a child.
That risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to print their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and custom enforcement officer, testified to the Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminals.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules, leaving some of them obliged within one month of the start of detention, to appear before the court, instead of within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will stand for the court, rather than in person, through a video conference to advocate their application for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes, according to the staff at the shelterer and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can contribute to the trauma many of them have already struggled with.
Syria commands the immediate withdrawal of the US's 'conservation force', France and Turkey
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Mr Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-president, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 36,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more are displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and counseling the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return, and he bets 'to spread irrational fears in some Western countries', leaving most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulwark of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has a large-scale attack by Russia-backed Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knows 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusa Front linked to Al Qaeda, who 'will be exterminated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN Member, hopes soon to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the Government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear what the Syrian Government's conditions were to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to review the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Period
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency was prematurely terminated by a decommissioning procedure and scandals.
What would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of grievances.
Since 2014, the viewing figures during prime-time at CNN have doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC's 'The Rachel Maddow Show' is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor', a series about a minister who will be president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
"He said then, 'Because he's making me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all the others on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you get to know that you've been sitting for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which is about the jack of peacock leather by Paul Manafort that has cost $15,000 ('a piece of clothing full of overconfidence' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
At least I'll never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's about a reality show is that he stops you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (a fight going on with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside to look at MSNBC while he picked up CNN.
He could not get off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember we were doing all those weird shows not so long ago, and that people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a reorganization of a constituency which requires two seated representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
The district of Pittsburg, which has been relocated recently, meets Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must address another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is very familiar with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district led to a knockout in the area of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a well-considered special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for support to China and abstained from this
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners put the Trump Organization management team out.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to call back the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognise Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, the Minister's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $ 140 million in US aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from leaving for the United States.
However, in mid-September some top officials from the government announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for half October, as a sign of the importance that the government attaches to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any hard news about Washington’s sanctions.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and who was also speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of the trial by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is likely to focus his research on the interplay between Trump's campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump has to account for himself for that institute, just as he is ready to turn to the voters again, and perhaps he has to be accountable for a jury in a court.
That is a lot of sayings, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to perform a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Checho-Slovakia had supported in Munich.
We fail and therefore miss an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of reference, and the inexorable march of democracy is being speeded up or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested secretly taking conversations with the President and that he had speculated on the suitability of the President for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
"How will we react if the new requested investigation from the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on the table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday visit and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee-blessure, the midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first race of the season until the 2-2 parallel game at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the results as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleventh" said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that something was going to win and came out of the game with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but seen over the entire game is an equal game probably an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
Coming Thursday is a new great European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points but it is going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last match. But if the audience gets behind us, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling-good-factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can now press ahead, leave behind us in the last season and succeed again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s research said that they talk to their wives about the cost of long - term care.
And only 10% said they talked to their children about this.
"People would like a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(e) and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not make your wishes known well in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take up a financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term funding choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use own funds as insurance, as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when insurance is required.
Make sure that you have a healthcare proxy so that you can assign a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals keep up with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial affairs.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and ensure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother encounters a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Set these details in a written plan, so that you have the information at your fingertips.
"It is not only the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes up."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Cops described the shelter, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'willful act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death toll will continue to rise.
As the means of communication have been switched off, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7,5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster has occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was the 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Donggala is a rainhouse that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The government, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, in particular in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit regularly by tsunami in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster response agency.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit nine deaths in the west of Donggala in 1996.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on north Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of this in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the South Coast and demanded nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the Richter scale met the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Regent Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found the death of falling buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, for the most part on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be stranded temporarily.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, is arrested for accusing domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition during the sentence, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone off her.
Palin is held in custody at Mat-Su's house with a $500 bailout, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, certainly' when he was asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and up to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for the Alaskan vetaning court.
In January 2016, he was accused of mistreatment in the domestic sphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after linking the violent behavior of her son to PTSS, that he would have retained his term of service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are disabled, while death rates are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the charge, used a hired truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he drove pedestrians and cyclists who came on his way, round in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'intentionally' killed the eight victims and 'intentionally' caused serious physical injuries, according to the statement of intent in which the death penalty is demanded, which has been filed in the Southern District of New York.
In both cases, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the appeal with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described the way in which Sajpov carried out the attack as ' gruesome, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was more than ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York there was a case in which the death penalty was demanded.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after being sentenced two years earlier for espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his deed, she the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, told the police.
He pleaded not to be guilty of the imposition of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
The Sajpov defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a "people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians must feel the 'hot' of the Eurosceptists, while one of the own Members of Theresa May proposed to give him the lead in the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on March in Birmingham that the UK would 'be out already' had been Mr. Farage Brexit Minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while this is being attacked by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Competitors insisted that it will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leaf in Solihull that he wanted to throw 'Chequers in the trash'.
He proposed that Farage should be knighted and that the negotiations with Brussels should be held under responsibility.
"If he made up the service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Member for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the trash."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be inferior.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed its mind and wants to remain in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a direct message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hit' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say to them, "We won't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to shine on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has brought us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this March with a meeting of two hours in the city center.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Toriesst Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour College, joked about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and for all technology for Canada plus, for the non-violent border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plant 'good to think about' about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, she will "think well about her candidacy for the presidency."
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican delegate who was co-chair of the Trom campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An audience asked her if she would stand for the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested after shooting Wayde Sims of LSU
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot in his head and died of its consequences," said Murphy J. Paul, police officer, to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and known to have been in the crime scene, possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and is detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98 meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him victorious after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position, leaving Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowded tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later entered the pits and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head again after a wheel-on-wheel action which forced the Ferrari rider with counter-space to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then the race leader for a long time because he stayed at his band's selection and aimed for a quick finish so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did his best fantastic all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me by.
The team did its best for places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she was not the source of the leaked letter by Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not talk directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he informed that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'commended, ugly and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you play?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter mentioning the allegations at Kavanaughh's address was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me confidentially to go, and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he made comments during the Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power, with all the necessary means.
You see the meanness, the dishonesty, they don't give anything about who they're hurting, about who they should drive to take power and get control back," the president would have said according to a report by Mediaite.

Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars has compensated for the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals leading through scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team side by side before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald established Nielsen with two goals of victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who on Friday evening had to make up arrears to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three games.
In the fourth minute, the Dwyer's opening goal arrived at an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist that Beauvilier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took their first break when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard again brought them on a par with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He made the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four out of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, while ensuring that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an aircraft
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that an aircraft with hundreds of people could board safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were still missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild again-moving traffic towers of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was at that time ready to take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic towers when he thought it was collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to the thousands and let the country's disaster response agency know that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching an altitude of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race inspired to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived on Sunday in Palu and he said to the present military: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?"CNN reported.
Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing over 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now saying that one more man is missing, after they had reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had become watered during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact order of events is, for the time being, still remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and some others succeeded in wading the water, which came to their aid, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and yelling and that he didn't have a serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seamen who were in the vicinity working on a yard have also helped in the rescue work by taking people to the coast with a inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into about 30 meters of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have found death in crashes of air carriers registered in PNG, but none of this concerns Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night on which a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his trial on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a one-hour witness as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone records of cell phones to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left her life.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police again started talking to Sanford.
Sanford was in the stand on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to tell the truth when he told me he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "smooth because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Width: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hipoptrio wants to question the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hiphop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and the identification of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had another experience in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A nanny from New York is suing a couple before the judge for a 'racist' text
A nanny from New York is suing a couple before the judge for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a falsely sent text in which the mother had complained about 'again such a black'.
The couple refuses to be racist and calls the trial "defrosting".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her horror when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negro-ided woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
'NEAY BEFORE WE'RE A SWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to Mrs Maurice.
According to the U.S. newspaper the New York Post, the "uncomfortably" feeling Plasco-Flaxman, Ms. Maurice, when she realized her blunder, said that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is taking the couple to court to get compensation of $350 a day for the six months she was hired to be intern with the family, though without a contract.
"I want to make them feel that you just don't do something like that," said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple abstained from the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after she, having been insulted by her, was afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists', told husband Joel Plasco at the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Don't give me that.
About the trial compare with 'torture', Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and 'in a very difficult situation'.'
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic', the investment banker added it.
While the trial is still in progress, public opinion is quick to chapter the couple on social media, where they are held for their conduct and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public wouldn't be very interested in a talking bear, revealing new raised letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it's very convenient."
She said that her father, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, if cameraman worked at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'bittersweet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes her as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lifelike for him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud when you didn't do anything about it yourself.
I think he experienced almost the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he named the bear himself for success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not make it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then the phone call from Nad came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping became slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before that, and this process went on to turn everything off.
I could only stay there knowing what was happening.
I couldn't feel sorry, scream or cry, because I was sitting in the middle of people and families.
I really had to keep big."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, stepped into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what the trial was going on.
"No one knew," she said.
"I was with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Raw women stick messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who are loved by suicide are strong enough to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's posters inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in Gloucestershire County, reports that her son was a promising chef with a stinging grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit every room."
Yet he stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling sad or depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He sat all the way down to the ground on Christmas Day - when the children took out their presents he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we must all continue to fight and continue to fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI investigations begin
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he is asking for; a study limited in time and size, we might be able to create more unity again', said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, amid a firmly anchored patting within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican followers not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections have been in five weeks, on 6 November and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their efforts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
Then there is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote in favour of confirming the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
Number of runners in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean invaders has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-suck, which quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of Entrepreneurship, declares that last year there were 1,127 survivors, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang hasn't responded in public.
The vast majority of the survivors from North Korea are ultimately offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarised Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the victims to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often exposes them with violence.
Relations between North and South, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnant negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the president of the US, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed in general to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting American sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the US's action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri during a speech for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Chairman of the House of Delegates, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate judge of the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and found him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her 'hysterical',' Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes screamed almost and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him 'grotesque and co-ordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,' Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to institute an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'That's what I can say about this; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or the FBI, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving', Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the 'District of Columbia' (usually abbreviated to D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh will speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the law for affordable health care). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh asked questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand cheering when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court', Pelosi says.
Women just have to admit this.
It's a righteous tirade of months and years of pent - up anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: "I am greatly helped by a woman who was leading somewhere and who told me that she too was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, where she was always going to cry. Toward the one she was talking to, she said, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partly permitted as expression of anger, because crying is substantially misunderstood.
One of my best-kept memories from a former job, in a male-dominated office, is when I had to cry awfully because I was very angry. An older woman, a guy company leader who was a little scared of everyone, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Congress for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means that 'cat' or 'apens') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not candidate for herself.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was left with fundraising, and so she vowed not to join if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she wondered.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, by frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she choked on it.
'I will have thought I had a nervous breakdown,' Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
"They'll have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafened, and although the battle has not yet been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts in the long term, favour Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the U.S. president, gave the first warning by raising taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (€150 billion) of goods; half of all goods coming from the USA from China.
Beijing has taken in kind represailles every time, most recently by increasing prices from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars for American goods.
China has promised to equalize the US every time, and the world on one of the second largest economies is probably not going to blink quickly with the eyes.
To allow Washington to bow, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays the smart game, the trade war with the US, China, could be positive in the longer term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which could lead one of the two countries to fall into an economic free fall, is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously recognized', says Abigail Grace, a research assistant of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specialising in national security issues focusing on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war of more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Walid al-Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
An estimated six million people live in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated land.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn won the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the U.S.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the whole tournament, had his long beat from the tea in the water at par 3, hole 16, and gave his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament in its present form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest ranking player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole playing Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, once became the best European player of all tournaments with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help', said an empress Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel because I have defeated Tiger Woods. I've been following that guy all the time when I grew up," says 23-year-old Ramm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
The American commander, Jim Furik, said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these boys, they've fought.
Shortly this morning, we made Europe a little more difficult.
We offered resistance.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota provinces
The most recent report of the 'Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission' (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decrease in red fire concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the US).
According to the committee, it is reported on the fragmentation of the red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a fall in concentrations.
The red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
There are spots about 16 km off the Hillsborough County coast, but in less places than last week.
Red fire has also been seen in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported off the coast of Pinellas County over the past week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations on or off the Sarasota County coast, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or off Lee County coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are ongoing reports of respiratory tract irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwest of Florida, there was no mention of respiratory irritation in the last week.
