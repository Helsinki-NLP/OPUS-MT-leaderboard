Biden conducts peer reviews in three key states
When there are only 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a leading Democrat, takes advantage of the lead in three important swinging states.
CNN reports today that Biden was over in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden measures 51% compared to 46% of the president.
In Arizona there is 49% – 45% Biden in the wild, and in Michigan the victory of Biden leads by 12 points, 52% – 40%.
To win the election in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these states we, and actually more.
Trump is currently suffering from a coronal epidemic that is increasingly being taught by the countrymen, and he says that the vast majority of the questions asked in the United States have responded badly, or very badly at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has been misrepresented by protests and riots that struck George Floyd's death.
According to Trump and his government, they have dealt badly or incorrectly with them.
To crown Trump's problems, he is now under more serious criticism for ordering federal police to break up protests in cities where mayors or governors are Democrats.
It has created huge wolves among the inhabitants of the cities, and that anger has spread to other Americans.
Also, photos of federal police to stab protesters into unmarked cars have not helped the United States cause.
The Lincoln Project's advertisement focused on this, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with a very small vote.
In fact, Trump won very many states with a small vote and won the election with a minority vote.
Michigan, for example, won only 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearly all the polls that political commentators say are significant are showing the same conclusion that Biden is making.
A new study of CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s advantage is now out of the scope of the survey.
The same goes for CNN and Quinnipiac University of Florida.
In fact, Fox News, who leaned right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published research into the same subject in its media.
The president’s last hope, according to the conclusions of the polls, is that Trump might be hoping to return to important places within a swing if attention in the campaign is directed to the economy.
The economy of the United States took a heavy hit following the Covid-19 epidemic, but voters do not seem to be linking the economic crisis with the coronal virus epidemic.
That is to say, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having been in a bad position to react to the coronary virus epidemic, but they trust him more to deal with the economic crisis that exists in the state at this time.
However, Trump has failed to direct the debate in the election campaign.
As a result of the riots that have been nearing flames since the video was horrified, as four police officers killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the debate on its law enforcement and importance.
Law and Order, became his common words.
It seems now that what was said earlier has been completely lost.
As the polls lean more toward Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to leave Trump and declare support to either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without specifically naming him.
They do so because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same ballot.
In this way, the voter can simply label the second category in the vote part of the ballot, leaving it alone to be a vote for all other candidates of that category on the ballot.
Thus, in another office, the proponents of the Republican Party tempt themselves to withdraw from the sluggish pace of Trump and to achieve independent results in the elections.
The Olympic Games of Youth in Dakar Delayed until 2026
The youth’s Olympic Games were scheduled to be held in Dakar next year, which has now been postponed to 2026 because of the chronic epidemic following the agreement of the International Olympic Committee and Senegal.
However, the suspension of the first Olympic Games to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
Volunteers arrested for the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in Nantes Cathedral, France, has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
According to the prosecutor, Le Monde, the suspected fugitive from Rwanda, who served as church overseer, admitted to lighting the fire.
The man’s lawyer, in conversation with another media, tells us that man looks after his actions.
What was destroyed in the fire included an organ from the 17th century onward, and the church’s historic windows.
The volunteer, who is 39 years old but has not been named, was arrested shortly after the end of July 18, but was then released.
He was then given back to a report yesterday and was then put in custody.
"No way out of this"
I am well received in the home of Baltasar and Christopher Samper in Copenhagen.
The reason for my visit is the new performance of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, who will be opened on August 1st at the Lagoon of Little Kambi on Snæfellsnes.
Is this the first time the Father shows together?
I'm led down to the Baltasar's workshop, where there's a lot of great paintings on my face.
Large and dark pictures of women of earlier times but also of flying creatures; eagles of one, shadowing birds of another.
The workroom is out of the house.
"We had a horse here with us that bit the grass," Baltasar told me.
"The horse works much better than the slaughtering machine on these hills and altitudes that we have."
Mireya is with us the Christian family and the Baltasar, and she tells us how her work is shaped by what is happening here.
‘Inclusions, blends of paperwork and jewellery.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad is doing, because I'm working with the light and stuff," she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works that I was working on and had wanted to show there, but they were stuck in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my father started painting and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my part," said Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong scoring in Icelandic legends about women's men and women's bodies.
“When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the ladies, I thought it was my choice to make jewelry that is related to them,” says Mireya, but the jewelry she works with the Victory of No Bear Son at Sign’s store.
"That's how I put it out of my jewelry."
Last year, Mireya's 72 artists attended the Academy of Sensitivity at Snæfellsnei, including the Little Kambi Ladder, and found the building fascinating.
“This is a new space, an old barn that has just been built,” says Mireya, who talked to a Baldvina Sverrisdód, an artist who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up a show.
“ She wanted us both to show, and we thought:
“Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938, and he attended the University of Art in Barcelona before going on a world tour to study art collections and research.
He came here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by a country and a nation.
He returned here a short time later, met his wife, Kristina, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a powerful artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows with Christ’s people around the globe.
He is best known for his large murals, which include a wall decoration in the Flatey Church and a fresco in the Vidstaskirche.
"What matters to what I do is the bitterness that Iceland has and no other place," says Baltasar.
“ This low sun and these shadows are reaching out and reaching out.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Well, here's workable."
Mireya is the oldest child of Kristjöna and Baltasars, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was perfectly clear that I wasn’t going to be a picture artist, ” she asked if she wanted to follow in her parents’ footsteps.
“ So I went on a math course in high school and did everything I could to get away from it.
Then I realized that I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up," said Mireya and laughed.
She has, like her father, shown many things around the world.
Much in Japan, to form.
All the children of Baltasar and the Christian family have walked the art path.
"I call this virus," says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
Count Icelandair has been in grey areas when flight attendants were cancelled
Minister of Social Affairs thinks Icelandair has been in a grey area when the partner broke up with all the airline girls in the middle of a pier.
He then said that laws that would prevent firefighters from entering residence would be taken for consideration after the Brotherly City Bridge.
On July 17th, Icelandair proposed to cancel all the 38 flight attendants who worked with the partner while the airline company was still on the table of a government charterer.
Some comments were made as to whether Icelandair was able to address these statements and were prepared to resolve the matter before the Society.
However, this never came to an end, and Icelandair gathered more than a day after the announcements.
However, the Minister of Social Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Dadason, says that in his view, Icelandair was in a grey area and was in the right payroll.
“ My view is that this is a right that is to be defended by wage earners.
When you're in a conversation, when you're in a meeting room, it's not an option to go this way.
It is perfectly clear to me that this had not been done.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into the grey area there what this touched," says Ásmundur.
He will not thus speak for the fact that other companies are going the same way as Icelandair.
“You are now discussing dangerously that it is only normal to go uplifting this system in order to reduce this right, and so I am totally opposed. ”
In the morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the government’s reaction to the fire at the end of June, where three died.
The minister now says the study at the level of the House and the Human Labor Office, to which he has made direct remarks.
“ It is in the law today that the fire department must not enter the residence.
I have asked the Department of Humanities and Humanities to examine in particular whether there is a reason for any legislative change.
I am ready to bring forward the legislative changes that need to reduce the chances of such a happening again," says Ásmundur Einar.
The interview with Ásmund can be listened to as a whole in the player below.
United States reported an increase in job pressure Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further efforts to force a European company to abandon the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, led by Russia, according to World on Sunday, which points to people who are familiar with the issue.
According to the newspaper, officials of the State Department, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Energy of the United States have contacted European contractors to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
As many as 12 officials should have held at least two online meetings with representatives of enterprises in the last days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had stressed in a “friendly ” tone that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
"I think this is a very, very serious threat," said one nerdy person to the German media.
These threats are in line with the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo’s statement last week when he warned that companies involved in the project would be best “to get out now” or to be at risk of punishment according to 232 parts of the notorious Law Countering America’s Advertisements Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to this, five European companies participate in the project, the Russian energy man Gazprom, who supervises the development of the project.
This is the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch Shell company in addition to Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with the World on Sunday, a representative of the last - named company said that the efforts of the United States to undermine the “high - quality infrastructure project ” were a clear intervention in the European empire.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate approved a change in the law on national defence, which aims to extend US sanctions against companies participating in the deployment of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the legal agents, the power may be directed towards companies that pay for or provide ships, insurance, port or service to such ships, as well as those who offer a witness to Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of US initiatives to trade in European energy by resorting to sanctions against Nord Stream 2, and some of them have even called for Brussels to cooperate.
Moscow’s officials have also harshly criticized Washington’s action and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, President Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would set up a new plan on how the project will be completed if Washington officials maintain the new sanctions.
Making further transfers of public institutions to the country
Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Ministers are planning to transfer more public institutions to the country in the near future.
In the fall of the Minister's decision, the Ministry of Health and Humanities will be moved north of the FYROM, but experts within the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move north.
Mr. Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Childhood, said in the spirit of the Wave this morning that it was important for the countryside that public institutions be established there.
Therefore, there is a great creation of value that also creates diversity.
“ It’s nationally important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
The construction of a job, the building of a payroll, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural resource, and this kind of work that is public service, they are very supportive of that construction," says Ásmundur.
"Creates increased diversity, creates better support under this resource efficiency and the creation of the nation."
The decision to transfer the Office's fire department has been strongly criticised by its staff and by the National Association of Firefighters and Medical Transporters.
Six people who have fire - and - fire expertise and work in the department are all residents of the capital area and are not going to move any of them to South Africa.
“ I think it’s quite clear that it’s a political exchange of views on how hard this should be done.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should take drastic action to spread public service better," says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighbors, Norwegians and Danir have been doing this with good results.”
He is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more widespread public institutions across the country.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the Department of Humanities and Humanities."
He is taking examples of the transfer of food agencies to Selfoss, Iceland's surveyors to Akranes, and unemployment insurance to Skagerland.
“ Today, it is a place of work at Skagerrand that is of great importance to that community.
I think we should take another step into this creature."
“ I’m preparing a further step in this creature.
More transportation."
In the fifth twenty arrests in Seattle
Systematic racism and the U.S. president’s decision to send federal police forces into cities to say goodbye was protested many times yesterday.
In the 1950 ’ s, Protestants were arrested in Seattle.
The Seattle police used bombs and pepper sprays in a large number of protests yesterday described by the police as riotous.
21 policemen were injured, and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months ago, a protest against systematic racism began in the United States after a police officer killed George Floyd.
The protesters in Portland were the object of the blow.
There has been a series of violent attacks between police and protesters since the United States President sent in the U.S. federal police forces who have been driving unmarked cars in unthankful authorities.
Thousands met in Portland on the weekend, using the police of tear gas and rubber bullets as a bridge between them and Protestants.
A miracle child 47 years of age was identified
The American real - life star Kenya Moore is doing well by strengthening people who need technological fertilization.
Moore, who is known for his participation in the Real Housewives of Atlanta, earned his first child 47 years after the technological fertilization and calls his daughter the miracle child.
“ Almost all my life was waiting to have a baby,” said Moore during an interview with the People.
"As much as I know the anguish people feel, especially women feel, that I might not possibly have a child."
Moore realized that she was running out of time when she turned 40.
“ I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and waited for forty, and I looked up and thought my god good," said Moore, who, however, did not know his father until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The real - life star says that his daughter is a miracle child in more than one way.
In addition, Moore was older than most of her firstborn brothers, her daughter came into the world one and a half months before the set day.
Moore went to an emperor’s ditch that proved to be difficult and took much longer than a conventional emperor’s cut.
“I call her the miracle baby because it was a child that everyone said was virtually no chance for me to have," said Moore during the interview.
Fathers arrested in Mizoram with an worth 15.4 million rupee of heroin
The heroin’s value on the home market was about 15.5 million rupees, and it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
The man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg of heroin in the Hnahthial district of Mizoram, near the border with Myanmar, after the police on Sunday.
The heroin’s value in the home market was about 15.5 million rupees, and it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested on Friday night in the village of Ngharchhip, reported a police officer.
They also lost some 280 grams of heroin, worth about 1.5 million rupees, swimming across, on their flight from the police, to the office.
According to police information, this is considered to be one of the largest quantities of heroin ever stored in the state.
The defendants were brought to trial under appropriate 1985 legislation on drugs and hallucinogenic drugs (NDPS).
Even if a border between states and Myanmar is closed because of the coronary virus epidemic, there is no need to smuggle drugs and other commodities, as reported by the police.
The Assam troops recently seized 25 truckloads of betel loots smuggled from Myanmar, but their worth is about 40 million rupees.
A doctor ran 20 miles [35 km] with a mask
The British physician Tom Lawton ran over 35 miles [35 km] with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation was not reduced when using facial masks.
Lawton, a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital, has worked there while the pandemic has been on the road.
To refute the oxygen saturation theory and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run back to work and back with a mask.
Before taking off, he set up a collection of GoFindMe for The Trusell Trust, which provides food supplies in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of all things that keep us safe.
That's why I've been in shock at the wrong information that's been coming between people that a face mask reduces oxygen saturation in people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously struggled for three years, but during the pandemic, he had endured.
On Monday’s last day, he ran a mile [35 km].
“ I never took off the mask (no food or drink), and the oxygen saturation became resistant to 98% every time I looked at it, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter at the end of the race.
Prince Jehoakim still in the hospital
Prince Jehoakim of Denmark is now at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and is constantly in his condition.
The prince underwent a brain surgery yesterday after having been diagnosed with a blood clot.
“ Prince Joakim’s condition is still constant.
The prince came to the hands of professionals in good time and feels good after incidents.
It's too early to tell how long he'll be at the hospital right now," said Lene Balleby, a Danish king's hall official, in a written reply to the Danish radio.

Gottlieb warns that the uncompromising spread of the coronal virus in society makes it “very difficult” for schools to open in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former U.S. Food and Drug Control Officer, warned on Sunday that opening new years of study will be “very difficult” for school example if the coronation virus spreads smoothly within these communities.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to examine the distribution within the community.
If the virus is distributed freely in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that state," said Gottlieb of the Face the Nation.
Since autumn break is scheduled to begin next weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and offer courses at school five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos will come a week after Trump warned that the coronary virus epidemic would probably be “worst before it gets better ” and confirmed that school practice in places where the situation is worst may have to be postponed for a few weeks.
However, on Thursday, the National Center for Disease Prevention gave advice on how to be safest to open school for students.
Among other things, the guidance calls for distance between people in schools, for example, and for students and for staff to use facial services, and for students to be divided into restricted groups to reduce the risk of infection.
However, the Centers for Disease Control did not issue standards to school directors regarding when they should close schools if there is a growing number of coronary virus infections, as Gottlieb says, have been “unlucky. ”
“ When this uncertainty prevails and detailed counsel has not been given on how schools will be opened, ” he says, “I think that more parents will be careful. ”
“That is why I think it is very important to find out exactly what the criteria are, which the National Centers for Disease Prevention did not provide in their guidelines.”
Gottlieb said that when deciding whether to keep schools open or to switch to online teaching, schools must think about the proportion of positive infections in society, local expansion, and testing.
If between 5 and 10% of the analyses give a positive result, “the problem is getting worse” but more than 10%, “the threshold is when it needs to be carefully considered whether or not to close the school system. ”
“This is a sign that the epidemic has reached its foothold in society,” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make things of the Florida state, which is the center of the colonial epidemic in the United States, difficult to open for school training next month.
Coronary virus transmission has increased to more than 30 countries, and Colombian regions, while the center of the epidemic is currently in the sunbelt on the South Coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, however, said that there was evidence of a slowing down in the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
However, despite Gottlieb’s saying that there was a “significant sign ” that the epidemic in some countries in the sunbelt began to be slowed down, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois.
Many governors have set rules that require people to use masks in public spaces and stopped the open - up process to detect the spread of the siron virus.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas, and other places that offer indoor entertainment, and setting rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that enable governments to avoid taking back the strict restrictions imposed at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the use of masks by various countries, various companies have forced people to use facial defenses.
McDonald's Swift Bitter is the newest company to make use of face guards, adding it to a group of companies like Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he expected that more companies would assume a masky duty with him, especially since the danger is considered to be great.
“If we can really control the epidemic when winter goes on until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease, we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something we can all do but that doesn’t change our lives and lets us keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school,” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump did not say last week that he wanted to use masks in the whole country, he urged the Americans last week to use facials and told the news conference of the White House that “they had an effect. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson, "It's news to expect."
The members of the Crystal Palace received a call for the summer when Roy Hodgson, CEO of the Society, declared that he wanted to leave the company.
The elephant has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and seems now to be leaving, but he has previously been spoken with a team like Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will see whether a team in that quality group is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially at the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a period where Zaha scored four points and made five supports for the Palace team that caused a few disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “there was a news to be expected” about the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the applicant had ‘made it clear ’ that he saw his future elsewhere than the partner.
There are still three years left by the applicant’s contract with the Palace, and in the past year, the partner indicated that 100 million sterlings would need to coax him.
The Hodgson period ended with seven consecutive losses and a tie on the last day of the season, which led to the downfall of the team to the 14th.
Zaha found nets only once from mid - December to the end of the period with a long shot in the loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for a sale last summer when he tried to get away from the partner but no offer was made to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed an agent in January, which seems to increase the likelihood of leaving the partner, and in the next few weeks it will be without question in his priority to secure social relations.
Zaha is the player who played most minutes in the original English section of the Palace during the season and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction the team might need to deal with the funds available to the player.
Hurricane Hanna: Carbonovirus-borne Texas state is facing a high risk of floods in 'twine shells'
Weather reporters have predicted “water floods ” in southern Texas after Hannah’s hurricane reached land twice and resulted in heavy rains and wind gusts up to 40 yards [40 m] per second.
When he reached a beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first-degree storm (bottom-level five-degree scale) and he has now been reduced to a tropical storm, but rain could still rain 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including in Cameron County at the border of Mexico.
Hanna was the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean in 2020, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised the residents to be on guard: “This is not nearly over yet, and we are still expecting a flood of disasters. ”
In the last few weeks, Texas has been struggling with a large increase in coronal viral transmission.
The governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster report to 23 companies that are on the way to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through areas that have become the worst for the COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first landed at 5 p.m. on Saturday, 25 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, about 200 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far away, in the eastern part of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including in Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi set up gardens near street centers to be used if there is a crossing of the streets.
U.S. President Donald Trump said at once that the government was monitoring Hannah and Douglas, who headed toward Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the beach in Corpus Christi, said that the approaching storm had increased her anxiety because of her pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed at home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost as if it were a double blow to us.
I think a lot of people are nervous.
We'll get through this.
It's all good and strong and together."
Heydying on the South Seas
Hearing in the South has been exceptionally successful in some end of the weather as farmers have benefited.
Most have a first stroke, another slaughter is far off, and it is expected that some will reach the third stroke at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with local farmers, such as other residents of the country during the summer, and it has not spoiled the spread on farmers’ tunes.
That's the way it's worked.
Victory, son of Augustus, a cow farmer in the Birtinga Hollow in Hrunna, and an honest - hearted contractor.
“ Yes, it’s just been a good walk, I think farmers just have to be fried, it’s been going great because it’s been a really good weather for the past half a month.
Heyin is the very good end of the harvest good and the quality of the listeners fine all over," says Victor.
Victory says that it is growing, especially in cow farmers, that they live in flats or outsmarts, which have proved to be very good, but it is a long time to do so.
“ It’s lively, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable this past half a month or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and then it’s so comfortable to apply.
It all remembers, it's less stress and can be stored until morning sometimes what could be done today, so it's brilliantly comfortable.
But does Victor think that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could totally believe it, those who were first.
We started on June 17th, it could be that those who were first had to take three times something."
This is how they prevent the injury.
The edgeman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English section, is an enormously fast player.
His opposers have had it to intervene in order to ensure that he does not get past them.
This has resulted in his shoulder falling several times out of the joint, but now the wolves have come with a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports.
The Wolves game against the Crystal Palace had to see the paramedics lubricating something on the shoulders of the Traoré.
“This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a Wolves source, but what was being carried on was child oil.
“ Making him a sniper makes it harder for the defenses to catch him, so we can prevent further injury. ”
His shoulder Traoré first fell out of action when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped out of joint four times, now the last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Harry England Prince: The Duke’s friend of Sussex refutes claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
In a conversation with Sky News, Stott said that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no way different from the fabric of gossip, the only difference being that the book was bound up.
The ex - soldier wants to see more and more the positive things he and his wife have done, such as their charitable work.
Stott said: “I feel that what is there is in no way different from what we read in gossip, except now in an inspired book. ”
"There's a storyteller there, but there's no way it's from them."
"I think this is just one more attack on them, just like the gossiping magazines that persecute them."
“ I realize that they are in the spotlight and people want to know what they are doing, but I wanted it to be more about all the good things they have done and their charity rather than about their personal issues. ”
"Of course, they will never get away from it, because of their position."
The duke’s and the Duchess’s support of Sussex shone at the other members of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to take advantage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s astrologers.
She added that the rule of power within the royal family was permanent, but it was not possible to direct the public interest.
She also said: “The evidence is that everything they did in support of the queen tended to overshadow other members of the king’s family, and this was considered a problem. ”
"They're extremely popular."
“They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding.”
“But while Harry and Meghan were smaller than Vilhjalmi and Katrina, the news of this was as much because of the world’s interest in the couple.”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his entries on Twitter that fuel war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his thoughtless reintroductions to Twitter material — some of which have contained material from white racialism — would cause him the most trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he would look for his records, Trump replied: “Often, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk, and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, how glad I am that I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you get a phone call — “Did you really say this? ”
I say, "What is this?" and you find out something."
Last month, Trump caused a great deal of anger after re-arranged entries (partial matter from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages region of Florida, where an elderly couple called "White Power!" or "White Power".
And in 2017, Trump re-exposed three records directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, the leader of the right-wing band Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the rebirths that would have made him in the most trouble.
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t study it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what it says on the helmet, which is a little bit and you don’t enlarge it, sometimes — I’ve found that it’s almost always the rebirth that gets you in trouble. ”
The president often commends himself, boasts of his opposers, and the conspiracy of his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “false news ” in television shows and newspapers, as he says through untruth.
But the President’s own lies have often come under the microscope, and now Twitter means Trump’s entries as a misappropriator.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many countries are working to develop a different location technology from the GPS system.
According to an engineer doctor, there may be reason to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the United States Army.
The old Loran system has been rediscovering life.
The GPS technology follows us every step of the way.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, in survey, in industry, and leisure hours.
Most people do not think that it is a military device owned by the U.S. Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses satellite coordinates to a height of 20,000 miles above earth, and natural conditions have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to interrupt it.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these marks," says Sæmundur E. Thorsteinsson, professor of engineering at Iceland University and expert on risk management and security communication.
He also says that it is easy to send wrong signals, such as in warfare.
“The GPS system is owned by the US Department of Defence.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it plunges into the head of the very wise President to do such a thing, then he could probably do it," said Zeemundur.
Thus, many nations have become aware of other systems and locational techniques.
Both the Russians and the Chinese are working on their own satellite system, and the European Union is rolling off the Galileo site system.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may be more precise and naturally under the control of the European Union.
Then there is not one government that completely controls it but many," says Zeemundur.
But many have also begun to look back at the old larynx technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until the GPS technology took over.
The Loran signs are transmitted on very long waves from the transmitters down to the ground.
“It is then a new version of the Loran system, called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system of defense, because it is somewhat different to disrupt it, it is much harder than disrupting the satellite system,” says Zeemundur.
However, it is probably safer to have access to as most location systems.
Delegate Vern Buchanan’s experienced staff is killed by the coronary virus
“Gary was a professional in the fingertips and a loyal servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, the sense of humor, and the joy of helping others."
The Buchanan’s office published a statement in the early part of the month that stated that Tibbets had had no recent dealings with others in the office.
Tibbett, who worked outside the office, had served for Buchanan since 2011.
The Florida state has reported 414,511 cases from the beginning of the pandemic, which is more than the cases of 411,200 in New York, as reported by health authorities in the states.
The health authorities’ data show that hospitalization has increased by 79% from the July 4 national festival day of the United States.
The data also show that at least 50 Florida ICUs reached tolerance on Saturday.
"We were informed that this could have an effect," said DeSantis in June.
"At the same time, the police work and supporting it could have a perverse effect."
Flight from Hornaph to Cape Town
Turkey doves, rosaries, ring doves, cross - doves, glass jars, and crying are among the birds that have wandered to the country for the summer.
The Birds of the South East can almost daily see short news of the intrigues, where they have been observed and sometimes their sex.
They're a lot of bird lovers in Iceland.
To this end, the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species can be mentioned.
The group members number 14,600.
There are divided images of birds and it is obvious that Iceland is rich with good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
Brynjölf’s son is one of them.
Binna, as he is called, is a staff member of the Fuglat Centres of the South - East and the Naturburst of South - East Germany, and closely monitors bird life in that area.
He speaks nicely of these animals that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role there, and then it doesn't matter whether the bird is a large and large bird of prey or a small sparrow.
Founded in 2005 on the birthday day of the Hjälfdán Björn Son of the Kjjörnkers in Örea, the Fuglat Foundation was the Kjjärker in Austria, with the aim of maintaining the air and continuing the marked natural research that it conducted from 1940 onward.
“ Half past 13 years old when he began to feed information about birds, ” says Brynjulf in a conversation with the Kernel.
“We at the bird inspection station are not doing exactly what Half-Danish did, but are building on his data by counting and marking birds.”
A farmer and a common scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote numerous research articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, almost nineteen years of age.
Half a dozen and his siblings in the Kwikkers were interested in many of the people who came to know them in Icelandic nature.
This group includes Björn Gisli Arnarson, the “other employee” of the Fuglat Centre.
Bear grew up in the Reynivals in the South, and he received a rich natural spoil from his neighbors, Half Death of the Kwikkers.
What, though, is the true experience of the South - East Fuglat Center?
By about March 20, each year, the Fuglat Centre sets up a special bird anthem in Einarsunden, a treelike dose within the Horn of Horn.
Standard meanings are made there on the birds that come into the network.
The nets are taken down around May 10th, when the vortices begin.
The nets are up every day, from at least about six o'clock in the morning until noon.
And they need to visit every hour.
The birds that come into them are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks a wonder.
“Yes, we share this with ourselves, me and Bliss.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a lot of puzzles, but somehow we manage to do it," says Brynjulf.
The nets are then put back into the period from August 1 to November 10 — all the days of weather.
Between guarding the nets and the periods they do not live, Brynjulf and Björn are marking the crickets, foams, and various mosquitoes where they reach them.
In addition, they take on a number of special assignments.
One of these projects is being carried out in cooperation with the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences and is about collecting forest mites from birds.
“ The forest butterfly jumps at the birds at their winter stations and then goes with them to springtime.
This happens shortly before they leave, which is why these ticks are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find himself some other host when he needs it."
But enough for ticks.
Asked how the birds in the southeastern region had this summer, Brynjulfur says that the throw of the cricket seems to go well — where it over the head is laying.
“ The world of the war here is at Hala, South, and everything is going well.
But it is not a lay-off to find any longer at the Jakull árlon, where several years ago there was a huge laying."
A few years ago, he said, more than a thousand crickets were thrown there, but now they can be counted on one hand.
“When we look at moans and weeds, I think it’s reduced in the last few years how you feel about them.
But of course there's always a change between years."
What can explain the great change, according to Brynjölf, is most likely about food supply.
"It's all about food."
Then, too, man’s works can be related to the offspring of birds and other animals.
Some birds, though, seem to be doing a lot of good in the South East this summer.
"One of the things that I think is good is that I prefer to grow again after a great deal of rainfall," says Brynjulf, "but in the meantime, the foam has fallen terribly in recent years and decades."
Of sparrows, it seems that the marionage is going to do a good job in summer, as was the case in the previous year.
Forest threshings and dufties had decreased somewhat, but Brynjulf says it doesn’t come to light until the fall of the summer’s experience.
But let's turn to the intrigues.
They often draw great attention, especially if they are very rare and even colorful.
These two interesting features have one of the most popular in the summer: Rosary.
"Others have been relatively calm in summer during the trekking," says Brynjulfur, but mentioning that in the country there is now crying and then a ring dove has been seen and is now laying here.
When Brynjulph and Björn get to grips with the entanglements, they also mean them, just like other birds.
Labels are international, and they are practiced worldwide.
The meanings, such as the winter spots of birds, where they lay, and the routes they travel can be found.
“ It’s even possible to see how long they’re on the move,” says Brynjulf.
These data are useful in many ways, in the form of epidemics such as avian influenza.
"There is always an increase in knowledge."
If someone in the world finds a bird marked by the Fuglat Centre South-East, the information is sent to Iceland's Natural Sciences Institute.
“We’ve got everything back from Cape Town in South Africa.
There we found a cricket that we had labeled.
One of us found later in the United States."
One bird is the Brynjulf especially the mindset, and it is the foam.
“The foam is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the Fuglat Centre and its Naturst Office of South-Eastern Germany have been tasked with observing his offspring — which has become rather sluggish, and now he is on the watch list.
It is difficult to say what caused a collapse in the breed, but one theory is that the foam has made a seabed that was once thrown out by fishing boats and into the sea for good, but now it is much better to use and it affects the foam.
Are you in the best place on earth to watch birds?
“ You don’t make me say no, of course, ” recalls Brynjulf laughing, adding: “Now that we’re following intruders, we probably have to go out there. ”
But surely the South East is special when it comes to a bird’s life.
“This area is like pulled into the country from Europe, and then the birds spread out of here.
To be here looking at birds and ecstatic birds is very interesting, but there is less to be found in laying birds than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the shore, and from the sea, so that the area which it is suitable for bird inspection."
But does Brynjulf have a favorite bird?
He thinks about it for a short time before he answers.
That's a tough question.
“I’ve found nine out of the ten that have been seen in the land, ” he finally replies.
“I now find it one of the funniest to take pictures of horsesaws.
It's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen before in the country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But both of them have done so.
If you would like to pay more attention to Binna and Bössa’s work at the Fuglata thought centre South-East, you can observe their work on Facebook and on the Birds Web site.
Saudi Arabia — The Sun’s Coast of the Future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourism industry has grown enormously around the world in recent years, and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Consider annihilation of some 60,000 billion dollars (U.S.) to create a tourist paradise in the land.
The Guardian reports.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the way that Iceland and I should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to do so in bikinium.
How, then, should tourists be lured into this strangular Islamic country?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city where white beaches, moons (of course made up of men), drone taxis, and robots that serve people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be collected in the oil supply of the land.
The Crown Prince says that there is no discussion that women can avoid covering shoulders and knees in public places but admit that creating a tourist paradise in the country is not a simple matter because it is too hot when the sun is high in the air and cannot be relied on for wind.
But you may wonder, ‘ If they are unable to buy alcohol, they will not also lose interest in prospective tourists. ’
Francois Bozize, formerly overthrown by the Central African Republic Presi­dent, reports on presidential representation
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been overthrown by a chair, announced on Saturday that he would present himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the United Nations resorting to criminal acts and the fact that a warrant for arrest was issued for his pernicious crimes against humanity.
He announced his presentation in a speech before a large group of supporters of his class, Kwa na Kwa (“work, work only”), in Bangui’s capital.
This 73 - year - old general and military commander were defeated in 2013 in the rebellion of an alliance of the most Muslim rebels from the north who plunged the majority of the nation into a violent civil war and a severe and prolonged humanitarian crisis.
"The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction," said Bozize in a speech critical of the current President's term of office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took office after the election in 2003 and served as president for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and for encouraging a genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in the past year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign acts of punishment affect his performance.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to remove the punishments imposed in 2014 for alleged support of armed Christian groups of Anti-balaka.
Today, Touadra runs the country with the support of the vast peacekeeping force of the United Nations, which counts more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016, and he is expected to present himself in a different season, but his presentation has not been confirmed.
The first round of elections will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups, who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has been reduced, but there are still bloody incidents that are often caused by conflicts over resources, but the majority of this diamond - rich country is not under the government’s control.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee from their homes.
The State of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is 'unacceptable for everyone', says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, the centerman of Real Madrid, says that Gareth Bale’s Spanish team position is “unacceptable for everyone. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he participated little in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now in the summer there is the platter that the player intends to keep still and let his contract expire, but the partner hopes that he will disappear on the track.
“There’s no way to prevent the situation from becoming unacceptable to everyone,” said Kroos on Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He wasn’t bought to play him as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the partner had actually said 'yes' but then said 'no' later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When asked if circumstances would have negatively affected the real atmosphere, Croos said: “Not as much as it would be expected.
Everything's fine with the team. I've known him for six years and we've been working something important together."
Chinese give Reykjanesbæde 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the coronary virus
Chinese Ambassador Jin Zhijian handed over two thousand face masks to the city’s mayor, Reykjanesville, over a week ago.
The reason was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese embassy last July 22.
The news of the war first reported.
The reason for the visit was to pay back the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjanesby, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
Reports Vics report that there was talk of promoting friendships between Reykjanesbäber and Xianyang City, but the local communities began their cooperation between 2014 and the year.
The gift, 2,000 facial masks, is rooted in this friendship, but the mayor of Xianyang wanted to give a mask and thus support the fight against the coronary virus epidemic.
Reports the Viker news that the masks will be used at the sensitive institutions and work stations of Reykjanes cities for both employees and other visitors arriving there.
In the accompanying picture you can see in addition to the flags of Iceland and the People's Republic of China, the inscription on the face mask box, which says, "Ber is who behind, except for his brother."
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates by lowering the pay
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland KR, next month and says he's interested from the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has been playing in Iceland since 2017 and became the Iceland Champion with both Val and KR.
On the other hand, this 27 - year - old visitor says he is missing Danmarks and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jakobsdódur.
Danan's contract with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company would have to negotiate with KR for a purchase price to obtain it in August, before the new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until the winter to get to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know the Danish departments are starting again at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I would have to cancel my contract with KR-ings, but I've told them that I miss Dance Marks, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with the Rúnar Kristinsson trainer, who had shown full understanding of the situation, and Thomsen said that he did not think the price would be a big problem.
“ I have also had conversations with two 1st Branches after that department was finished and the team knew where they would end.
It has been a little interesting already for the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic division stops," said Thomsen, but added that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark who could buy up his contract with KR.
“ It’s not quite clear now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, saying, looking first at the Copenhagen harbour.
Thomsen told KR-ingen not to worry that he wouldn't give himself all to practice and play, although he missed Dance Mark.
“KR knows what it gets from me, and it’s that I do things 100 percent.
I can totally ignore the fact that I miss Dance Mark when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who plainly admits that he's going to lower his salary by leaving Iceland's championships in the second division of Denmark.
“ I’m likely to have to lower my wages only because of the coronal virus crisis, which seems to have rocked Danish companies only more than they do.
But I am also studying, and one solution might be that a company has provided me with a job.
Most of the members of the 1st Division have an agreement with the sponsors.
I'm learning sports control through the playthings and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the lead team of KR in two games at Pepsi Max during this season, but has a history of five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven points.
KR is equal to the choice of the points at the top of Max Pepsi and the game for good, but the team will show up at Akureyri today.
Accompanied by the corona virus on board a bus, the driver gets into a hot argument about a face mask
The video shows a passenger and driver on board a Arriva bus in Liverpool handling masks.
The driver hears a woman explain that it is not in his job to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said: “It’s not in my business to tell everyone who gets into the car to use a mask. ”
Witnesses said this about the incident: “A man and an older woman started giving birth to her, and much controversy broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was actually going on, and he told one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask properly. ”
"That woman then pulled away from the bus and said she was going to report the incident."
A spokesman for Arriva said: “The security of our customers and our employees is at our priority.
"Our customers are obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptional)."
"Explains the guidelines and meanings for customers about this and all other distance rules are on board the bus, the community media and our website."
Since June 15, masks have been in force for public transportation.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the world - wide coronary virus.
Most of the COVID-19 cases have been reported in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer reports that Hollywood hires people with disabilities more often in role
The playwright is taking part in a new campaign to increase the number of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The campaign is under way at the same time as 30 years have passed since the United States passed legislation on the rights of people with disabilities, which is due on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer talks about the importance of seeing themselves and their lives reflected in reality on the screen.
“Nothing can replace personal experience and real - life displays, ” she says.
“That’s why it’s so important to have an appropriate actor in the right place.”
Spencer discussed the effects she had on seeing skin - black people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the “Good Times. ”
The components shown at CBS between 1974 and 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they rocked the road as the first feature of two African - born parents.
An association against hunger push Yoho aside after an incident in the House of Commons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization that wants to end hunger, on Saturday they said that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the government of the organization, and that he had suffered as they called the “attack” of Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Demokrata of New York, accused Yoho, Congressman of the Repulics of Florida, of using low-level and masculine predicaments when he rebuked her when they met on the doorsteps of the Assembly Hall last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he did not use the words quoted, but a reporter who testified that the incident confirmed that the phrase had been as she described it.
Bread for the World stated that the organization had met Yoho on Friday and sought after that he said of himself that he would “righten our commitment to living with women and skin-dark people, domestically and worldwide, leading us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
The Bread for the World website says that their “co - Christian voice ” pressured the Senate and the government to end hunger in the country and worldwide.
“Since Bread for the World is independent of Christian organizations that have the goal of reducing hunger and poverty with a solid public policy, the organization holds out the respect, dignity and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in positions of power, wherever they are in political spheres,” says the statement.
“Our assessment reflects recent actions and the words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements of our members of the government.”
During the proceedings, Yoho had not responded to an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech in the Assembly Hall last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez, in a dramatic manner, spoke out against what she called a men's reunion, which "accepts violence and violent speech against women".
More than dozens of her fellow workers agreed that the incident was an example of all too common men.
Yoho described the incident as a brief discussion of policy and that “no one had been distressed, harassed, or attacked. ”
He said that he regrets having shown “pleasant approach. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in his first period as a progressive senator and has received both praise and praise for his cleanness.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most conservative members of the council and will sit in a sacred stone at the end of his fourth election period.
Wait until 98 minutes in the room by scoring the first goal of the season
Jesse Lingard had not scored or pitched in the English high school league during this season, until he scored against Leicester today at the 98th minute of the final round of the league.
Lingard had not scored in the English high school since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in as a reserveman for Manchester United today when Leicester came into a championship game for the Championships.
When more than seven minutes had passed the normal playing time, Lingard picked up the ball from Kasper Schmeichel Leicester’s goalkeeper and scored the empty goal.
Long-term goal at Jesse Lingard.
Players of Real Madrid are exempt from the rules on sickness
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England for the second time at Manchester City, Europe’s Most High School, without having to go for two weeks.
The British government has decided that travelers from Spain need to take a two - week charge to curb the spread of the Corona virus.
There are exceptions, however, as in the case of athletes at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed a team of athletes at Sky Sports.
According to the Office, those who are exempt from the rules will only be in remote areas, by closed doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and the media.
So on August 7, Madriders can meet Manchester City without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2-1 below in the single week after losing to Santiago Bernabea on February 26th.
The victory will continue in the 8th final in Portugal.
The rain of the storm, and the rain of the land, shall be upon the sanctuary of the merchants.
News from overcrowded hotels and tent areas to judge, in the least south, that Iceland has been able to travel domestically this summer.
At the same time, those who have set foot have had endless success with weather and weather forecasters DV agree that the summer has only been well said out, at least to the point.
But it is now time for a shopping weekend, which has been the greatest weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared with other weekends, because events that have led many people to fail to live in the usual year are now under way.
There, for example, is enough to mention a national festival.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now it is the view of rainstorms all over the country, but especially the south and southwest.
The weather room predicts an outburst of rain from Thursday night and at least Saturday night.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not sacred truth here on the northern Atlantic Ocean and can, of course, change.
The meteorologist kneels the son of Einar Sveinbjörn in his prediction of his weather tissue, Bliku, that it is low to expect the temples of the merchants.
Says him: A doctor’s dung in the sky with a cooling cold that too often also goes down to the surface, leads to the arrival of warm southwestern air with only wind and rain.
Of course, there is also a warm air that “feels ” across the north.
In support of his prophecy, Einar says: “A small wave from America goes to the east and with it a summer - colored air.
As she approaches, she becomes “blooming” in the form of a lowering of air pressure and a considerate summer drop. ”
The great prediction, the European Center of Accounts to the left of the map, and the U.S. G.F.S.
The separation of the low is predicted by the late on Thursday and early on Friday with heavy A-like and rain in most of the land.
The medicine of 985 hPa is then followed.
This time there's some warm air in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
On the other hand, it may blow.

Followed by an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
"I was shot in her like a man getting such a young shot," says Birna Rönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, the lead actress of the Law and Orders: Special Victims Unit.
She was so disgusted by the actress that she showed up at the scene and waited for her for hours together, just to be able to say hi.
When Birna Rönn Björnsdóttir, the owner of the Pink Iceland travel office, looked like many Icelandic residents on Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the turn of the century, she collated for the principal actress of the Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and her actress on the part of Love Stories of the 1st Council.
When Birna himself was a teenager, at the age that many people began to develop with him violently, she did not feel it like her peers because she was in a hurry to suppress her own feelings.
She thought that she was interested in boy bands and young magical movie - making heartballs, but she didn’t have them at all.
“ I was cutting pop sheets and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late cycle of happiness.
“ We spend our teenage years suppressing these teenage expressions, these shots, and such.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," said Birna about the actress.
“And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot at her."
When she was in New York City a few years ago, the actress’s snare ran.
One of her best friends, Erling Ottar Thorodsen, was shooting a movie there in the city and getting Birna and her friend, Gunnar Helga Gudjónsson, to help with the shooting.
“ We were working in 30 people and spending some time with strangers.
This is a natural atmosphere when you spend such a long time together a day so that it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, one day, Birna is a great fan of Mariska.
One woman in the recording team tells her friend to recognize the actress because he was in the filming team.
Birna could not stop thinking about the fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friend likes to work with the actress and whether Birna can get to meet her.
"She tells me to stop, she doesn't know if she can make it happen," says Birna.
When the film is finished, the group and Birna finally try to convince the woman to try to get around the meeting.
"She had already had a few glasses and said she would just do it."
A few days later, Birna sent a message asking if something is happening.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up with long - awaited messages.
“ I look at the phone and scream at myself.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up crying, and I say, "I have to shower and I have to make myself nice and go down to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actor, and camera crew Law and Order were at a hotel in Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, if you’re doing well,” says the messages, and Birna is dressed in a hurry, asking at the reception where the reception takes place and taking the elevator to the 45th floor where the group is assembled.
It happens and waits for a woman in the team to come to her and ask this unsolicited woman if it can help.
"I say I'm looking for Jason and I asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived."
When the friend finally arrives, he looks at Birnah foreshadowed and asks how, in the worst way, she came all the way to the end was to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she has just taken the elevator and asked to meet Mariska.
“Yes, I don’t know.
"Sit here," says the friend and Birna.
Next to her, an extra player sits in the show, and they start talking.
"I say to him, I am a fan, but you?" said Birna.
"I played this as if it were the most natural thing in the world."
Time's up and Birna's waiting.
The players perform regularly when a break is made, they get a talk, and Birna looks around and searches for Mariska, which is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he's sorry.
He asked Birna to get his hands on another employee because she did not consider going anywhere right away.
I wonder if the friend will accept it and reach another employee.
"He comes with his second friend and says, "This is the woman from Iceland who would like to meet Mariska."
Then he goes.
Finally, after a two - hour wait, the new friend comes running to Birnu.
“ He says, ‘ Hurry! ’
These are unusual situations today, there are reporters with her so she won't stop anything.
She goes straight to the car with them so you have to take the chance and go downstairs and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look to the right and lose my face" Birna rises high and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds forty bicycles, some marked, and some not.
On the other hand, Mariska’s bike does not feel, and then it becomes desperate to be engulfed.
“ I feel the breakdown poured on me because I had spent half a day in this, but I thought, well, I tried.
That was fun."
Wickedly, Birna goes back to the hotel where she sees through the window of the camera team looking at her face with pity’s eyes, realizing that Birna was unable to accomplish her mission.
Light will accept fate, and it will start to rain.
“ I go under cover to cover myself before the rain.
Then I look to the right and I lose my face."
No one other than Mariska Hargitay stood there in her pantsuit, which she wears in the parts and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move out of a mood swing.
“ I look at the body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you must go towards her."
Pearce does that and remembers to peck in the shoulder on the actress.
“ She looks at me and I can hardly say anything.
But I'm just saying hello, "Birna's looking up.
“I say I’m from Iceland and a big fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation did not go much further because Mariska’s car is here, and she is being whistled.
Turning to Birna, Mariska says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna says goodbye to the idol, watches the car drive away and then breaks apart.
“ I call a simmering in Erling and Gunna, and they thought this had not been done.
But I was crying with excitement and joy.
I say, "Yes, I'll meet her." You have to meet me now.
And then we toasted in soda and tequila," says Birna.
She does not regret anything, although she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ This is so once in a lifetime as to sacrifice such time and energy in acting like this.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Ránn Björnsdóttir on the part of Love Stories at Rás 1.
The police don't spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry that the coronation virus can be transmitted by means of alcoholic beverages used by the police.
This is said by a police officer in the Police Department in the capital area in a conversation with mbl.is.
Indications have been received from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police come to grips with the roadway and allows anyone who is heading for a blow.
The police, however, say that cleanness is the best thing to do.
“It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we have a recommendation for a cup that people blow into,” says a police officer.
"Some people want to warn us about this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, to a few centimeters."
Asking if it feels sufficiently distant, a policeman says it is.
If the test is positive, the police will use a different measure.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: may include anise to reduce pain
The association with depression is not accidental.
Subjects suffering from inflammation of the bowels, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, bloating, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms associated with the United States of America’s anxiety and depression (ADAA).
“This is because the cracker is partially controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If your Temban is not reduced you may be intolerant to food.
The judge is trying to stop the decision that children should be released from immigration.
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected deadline by saying that the immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not have to let children out of custody if it is not possible to do so by any of the three ways described in her previous order.
Gee, however, also stressed the need to release children without undue delay in its directive to immigration and customs authorities.
The three routes proposed by Gee are to release families who are in possession of immigration and customs authorities, to place children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families under federal law.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the Agency Proyecto Dilley, who provides legal services to families, condemned the decision and told it to the immigrant and customs authorities to decide whether to continue to have children.
“The main point I think is that children are kept in prison indefinitely and they don’t let out unless the immigration and customs authorities agree or families agree to let themselves be torn apart,” said Fluharty.
The families are held at three locations of immigrant and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Carnes County, Texas.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to legal representatives and lawyers.
Gee, who supervises the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children in prison, said in June that since “rules on masking and social exclusion were not or ill-implemented” it would be urgent to move children from these places of employment.
969 people in custody of the immigrant and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the corona virus and have been isolated or monitored as of 23 July according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the Family Care Centres.
A total of over 3700 cases have been confirmed in detention
Will examine the regulation of government independence
A prime minister does not say that life’s resources set criteria in their investment policy for the rights of workers.
Notes from the Bank’s Governing Board to ensure the independence of government officials, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After Icelandair closed discussions with the Icelandic Air Force Company and announced to all flight crews that the VR government declared that the government that VR had appointed managers in the management of the Icelandic Air Traffic Management Fund or made a vote against the participation of the livéris fund in the future Icelandair.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of VR, continued to say that if they did not comply with the recommendations, rulers would be replaced.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his declaration three days later, as did VR.
Ásgeir Jonsson, bank manager of the bank, said in RUV’s news on Friday that it would be necessary to ensure the independence of the government’s shareholders in the approved funds and possible legislative changes.
The Prime Minister’s daughter Katrin Jakob says it is important that government officials are independent, but it already believes it is guaranteed by law.
"Now, of course, the bank manager, who is dealing with the financial supervision that has this to do with, has said that it needs to be examined in particular the rules surrounding this independence, we will, of course, take it to heart if anything needs to be taken over there," she says.
Katrin says that according to the law, living resources set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is preferable that it discusses the social and moral standards that they want to emphasise in their investments.
“ I didn’t think anything unusual was that life’s funds also set standards in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
But I believe that such decisions have been made naturally through policy making, but not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
"Unbearable traffic jams at the River Elephant Bridge," said the president of the City Council of Year.
Saint S. Haraldsson, president of the City Council of Árborg, says a traffic jam, which forms at the River Elephant Bridge on Selfossi every day totally unbearable.
He hopes that in the fall there will be an announcement because of a new bridge over the River Elf.
Now that Iceland is travelling through its country and traffic is on the national highways, daily traffic jams are created at the River Elephant Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long lines form at the edge and can take on the patience of the drivers to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s totally unbearable, it’s one traffic jam here and not just on Fridays, because it’s only happened on active days as well.
There are a lot of friends, sometimes quite on Hellisheäri for those who want to get by on their way east of the country and those who are coming to the west, so that it gives an eye way that we need to get a new bridge and no later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City Council of Árborg.
Sanhedrin says that local authorities in Árborg recently met with the director of the Vega type and the designer of the Vega type, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you have ever been optimistic that it is working in these matters, I think I can say that now because it is really working in this and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being invited out in the fall. ”
But is there any counsel for the drivers who wait in the queue of the river Elves throughout the summer days?
"Yes, that you can go through the straits and through the Eyarbak, it is speeding up, but those who are going east on the bow, you can't tell them to go into the Lvegal Valley, but those who are going into the uprisings should use the Moslem Sea, the Dingvell and the Lvegal Sea."
Saint S. Haraldsson, president of the City Council of Árborg, who says the traffic jam, formed by the Olive Bridge of Selfoss, is unbearable.
A long circle of friends is formed every day at the Elsewhere Bridge, and drivers often have to wait for a considerable time to cross the bridge.
The only way to breathe is by taking a deep breath and thinking in a positive way.
The future of the polar bears in northern Brisbane is a matter of organization.
In addition to what the area is vitally home to koalabjarna, the sulfurica, and the grey gherkins, it would be an important link between the natural areas Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Operators have appealed to the Court of Justice for a rejection of the Structural and Environmental Funds, arguing that the structure is in line with the Civil Organisation Act of 2014, would meet the organisational and social needs that have not been met up to this date and ‘good progress is made without undue effect’.
There is great opposition to these planned projects in the neighbourhood.
The operators argue that despite the fact that it is fully in line with the organization, it could be altered if it did not meet the requirements, rather than reject them.
As it is, the work involves many stages, including a service center, a child - care centre, and 39 homes.
Official submissions were more than 120 during the conference, and most objected to the proposal because it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
A minority leader in Brisbane City Council said that the city would have to buy the land to protect the koala.
“The [urban manager] Adrian Schrinner has to stop wasting the funds of tax payers fighting the businessman before the trial and buying this country to protect Brisbane’s wildlife,” said the city councilman Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important home of coal bears in the Mountain to Mangroves natural area, and there is a large number of coal bears.”
Schrener said in the week that city government wanted to be protected by koala bears in the area.
"We didn't think the incident was suitable for the area," said Schrinner.
"I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will keep the home."
Schrener said that mapping to the home of a koala bear was the common responsibility of the city government and the government, but that the government was responsible for accurate maps of the home of the koala bear that local authorities support when applying for operations for treatment.
Sunshine: The next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach Man Udd, was hoping for a third seat in the English high school division today.
The team will therefore be playing in the European majority in the next period.
United needed a tie or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2–0 victory of the Red Devils.
“ A great achievement for the gamers to reach third place according to the situation during the season.
I think the boys and I could have overcome spiritual shocks by doing such a big game, as we've lost twice in preliminary colors in this period.
We knew we'd have to finish today, now we can start the next chapter that's for these guys to win the title," said Solskær's winner.
Manchester United still has a chance to win a title in this period, but the European Union has been playing in August and is almost 8-year-old.
A ceasefire begins at midnight in the war - torn eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — Ukraine’s army and opposition forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “complete ” ceasefire that will begin at midnight and that represent the hope of being the first step toward peace after six years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of the resistance said that they had given their soldiers orders for arms relief and issued a decree prohibiting the use of weapons.
Ukraine’s army said that its forces had “prepared for the armaments. ”
If this were to be achieved, it would "give way for the implementation of other provisions" of the Minsk Peace Agreement, as declared by the President of Ukraine's Office earlier in the week when the ceasefire was called a timetable.
The aim of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the apartheid people who enjoy the benefit of Russia, which began in 2014 following the invasion of Russia by the Krimskaganan and the country’s support for the apartheid.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed both the arms trade by calling on Sunday and stressed the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern at the request of Kiev that the Minks Convention had been reviewed and said that the position of Volodimir Selenskij, President of Ukraine, on the ‘disparity of the Minsk Convention, which he once again expressed in this call, should be reflected in real action’.
Selensky, however, stressed the need to take action to free the Ukrainian rebels in eastern Ukraine, the Crimean regime and Russia, as declared by the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have jurisdiction over the border with Russia in the areas of apartheid once they have obtained extensive autonomy and elections in the territories.
The convention reduced conflicts, but Ukraine’s forces and rebels have continued to fight.
When leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to hold other talks, support for the Minsk Convention was demonstrated and agreed to resume the peace process.
Selensky, who won the elections in 2019 with the promise to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to take over the border before the first regional polls, but the Kremlin government demands that the agreement be concluded without any change.
The new Armed Forces Agreement was reached on Wednesday for the creation of a three-sided team of representatives from Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday blessing on St. Peter’s Tower, Pope Francis also mentioned the arms section and said that it would have to “rebuild trust and lay the foundation for so much needed and long - awaited reconciliation with the people. ”
Police: A man shot to death at protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death at protests in Texas as he approached a car and the driver in the car fired his weapon, according to the police.
The police spokesperson Katrina Ratliff told reporters early on Sunday that the shooting took place just before 22:00 at Austin’s protest.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later judged dead.
The car had floated, turned down the road and then accelerated the journey towards protesters, told the witness Michael Capochiano of the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man with a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told the reporters that the first report suggested that “the victim could have had a rifle ” and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to newsrooms, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protests were streamed live on Facebook and heard in the fleet of the car and a few shots that were fired.
Marka soup in the first win of Blika in July
A big moment won its first victory from June 29th, when the IA defeated, 5-3, Pepsi Max-department of men at the Copavogsvell tonight.
Skagers lose their third game in a row in the league again.
After winning his first three games in the league, Breiða won five games without celebrating and had lost three in a row for the game at IA tonight.
So it was enough to do or die for Blika, who came into the game with great intensity.
Alexander Helgi, the son of Victory, led the team with a fine payment in 11 minutes after the Christian son Steindor had sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the lead after a very fine preparation of the Gísla Eyjölf Son on the left.
Shagarians did not get to land or shore in the first half of the world, where local people’s high - pressure pressure made them enormously difficult to link shipments together.
With all the power on the field, lightning struck the third target in 36 minutes when Danin Thomas Mikkelsen hurled the horned Horror of the Son of Gunnlaub.
Then the Christian Steindór son scored his second goal, and the fourth goal Blika only three minutes later.
However, the story of the first half did not end there.
The latter, when Trigvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored out of the waitress just before the time of play, was delighted with Kwame Quee’s clumsy break at Viktor Jonsson’s son in Blika’s pond.
Thus, 4-1 was the status for Breiða moment when the half-plane failed.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half when the Skagers scored again.
At that time, Zeevar Jonsson’s hymn was alone and unelected in a marketable Blika and easily guided the ball into the net after the horned Kryggva Hrafn Haraldsson.
However, within three minutes of his break at Alexander Helga, a bitch broke in.
The White Horses were judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen scored with certainty to reach Breiða moment 5–2 when only seven minutes of the second half were over.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen’s goal, the Skagmen again scored.
Anton Ari Einarsson, Blika goalkeeper, landed under pressure from Viktor Jónsson, gave the ball to Viktor’s foot where the ball was dropped on the net.
Unbelievable 5-3 events occurred when less than 10 minutes had passed by a later half-game, but it slowed down on the subsequent target score.
Despite the fine powers of both teams to add to the score, including two major careers in Kwame Quee from the Breiða moment, they did not become more and 5–3 wins of the Breiða moment's score.
A moment of breadth thus won its first victory in less than a month, from June 29th, and is passed after the victory with 14 points in third place, two points from the Val, which is the seat above and three points from the KR top team.
However, both KR and Valur have a game inside of Blika.
The IA has to accept the third consecutive loss in the league, but the team has ten points in the eighth, five points from the fall.
Despite the White House’s comments, the Puppets Force is not in danger
Yesterday the producers of the Huppas team decided not to stop showing the child’s material in the near future.
The statement follows on from Kayleigh McEnany, the White House's media representative, that the elements that include law enforcement dogs were the victim of "cancel culture".
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and announced that their fans would have no worries about the future of the Huppas.
A number of television programs dealing with police activity have been released in the United States recently following a protest against police violence.
However, the pup team is not involved, despite the fact that it was presented on the social media.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump was opposed to "the culture of exclusion" and, in particular, to the police.
The term refers to this when a person’s comments or actions or enterprises cause a severe reaction to the community media and is called after the party is opposed to Protestantism.
“We saw a couple of weeks ago that shows on the Puppets, children’s stuff about cops, were stopped.
"The same is true of Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took out a law enforcement post, but no foot is for the claim, according to defensemen Lego.
However, it is true that Cops and Live PDs have recently been taken out of the Western Atlantic show.
For instance, both participants are involved in the field of real police activity without the permission of individuals who appear there.
Together for 29 years - sometimes there is jealousy and suspicion
A family therapist named Kristin Thoma’s daughter answers questions about family, children, and love in the family horn DV.
This time she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years, and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and feel good, but both of us have suffered as if we were missing out on something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in connection with whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery or even divorce, and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is a nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a wonderful question and I'm glad you're so open to communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with the relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about this in each corner, you couldn't discuss it, and even take some steps that you might so later regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always best?
A strong self - image has the greatest prediction of happiness in the future and the stronger your self - image, the more likely you are to acquire a marriage mate with a strong self - image.
The reason why relationships that begin during adolescence do not always last all their lives is that people develop in one direction or another, but in the cases where there is a more beneficial effect, individuals can become stronger together than many others.
Since your relationship starts to develop in your most formative years, you can conclude that you have developed together and have a positive effect on each other’s self - image.
We are shaped by our relationships.
The way I speak is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn around and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does this many years of experience give us?
I allow myself to say that the benefits can be far more than the flaws.
You have been molding each other for years, and you can say that you are custom - made at millimeters.
That is more than many can say.
That's worth it?
You’re talking about experiencing the loss of something, but it’s important to remind yourself that big changes such as divorce and new relationships are also accompanied by accompanying fish that you’re not necessarily excited about.
You might miss starting again, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
This is accompanied by new challenges, different problems, and potentially new and exciting things.
But this isn't just a pink cloud and happiness, no, at your age, it can be a messy project, which may never be as good as you've done to each other already.
Is that worth it?
Would it not also be wise to focus on what you can do to increase tension, unforeseeableness, and newness in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to make your long relationship even deeper.
What can you do about it?
What do you need from your spouse that you are not receiving?
What can you give your mate, whom you have never done before?
You may have to settle down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, much more tolerance towards various forms of communication and couples has begun to define their relationships in various ways, e.g., open relationships, multi-ethnic relationships, or to temporarily cease.
I'm not telling you at all what to do, because no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would lighten that heavy fat that's coming on you, if you look into your eyes and think about solutions.
What do you need then distrust and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, that must mean you're able to handle things together.
Take advantage of it as strength and hold your hands toward your solution.
We encourage readers to send their questions and incapacitations to Kristinar by e-mail at: henonbandsaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here at the Family Corner, of course, without name and with full confidence.
Lost the cup and smashed it.
Despite the great experience of Branislav Ivanovic in raising the cup and celebrating titles, he lost his career and went on a magnificent career in cheering after becoming a Russian cupmaster yesterday.
Ivanovic won a number of titles as a Chelsea player in 2008-2017 and then went home to Russia and joined Zenit.
He has now become the Russian champion two years in a row, and yesterday the Cup Championship has won a 1–0 win at Khimki, where the victory goal came from Artem Dzyuba’s victory campaign in 84 minutes.
The prizewinner in the Russian cup is made of glass, and when Ivanovic, the leader of Zenit, lost the cup to the ground so that he broke, as you can see.
Ivanovic and his companions didn't let it go, and they continued to celebrate the night.
It's a war!
Coleen Rooney talks to lawyer Johnny Depp in the "Wagatha Christie" rhyme with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the accusations against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the footballers ’ mates went out, their acquaintances expected a dramatic decision
Coleen Rooney has hired the astrologer in Johnny Depp's cover-up case to defend himself in his so - called Wagatha Christie legal case with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday records that Rooney ordered David Sherborne to defend herself against the allegations that she had committed crimes against Vardy, with claims that personal information had been leaked to the media of her closed Instagram access.
A few days after the data were submitted to the Supreme Court, reports that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to candidate Jamie Vardy in Leicester City, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claim.
The paper says that the five children, 38 years of age, “had severe panic attacks and panic attacks so that she was afraid to leave the house ” and that Vardy, who was then seven months away,“ had been hospitalized three times... because of a panic attack attributable to the entry and consequences. ”
In addition to being Depp's lawyer in his criminal case against The Sun, because of claims that the actor had beaten his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, brought the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their private case against the Associated Newspapers, the publishers The Mail on Sunday.
After the failure of a conversation between the two football owners, those who are familiar with dramatic behavior in the courtroom are expected to do so.
“If you found the Depp trial sightings, don’t underestimate the anticipated war of football owners,” said one source.
"Now this is the real war. Coleen doesn't give up, neither does Becky.
Coleen Rooney argued that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy had leaked up stories about it for a newspaper.
She was named Wagathe Christie after she realized how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates on her Instagram stories until only Vardy’s account was left.
Coleen claims then had put up an uptight story on Instagram, which had then appeared in a gossip magazine.
According to Vardy, who refuses to take part in the case, she argues that after Rooney published the allegations, she was a bloated criminal, with the aim of causing serious harm and enormous suffering.
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words, saying that claims about their suffering are simply presented to the media and draw attention from the facts.
A source said: “The papers from Becky are misleading, this is all fabrication. ”

Biden's vote class refuses 'Fox News Sunday' about one week after Chris Wallace's interview with Trump
In Trump’s interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump was in no doubt that the prospective Presidential Democrats, Joe Biden, would be in charge of Wallace’s fall on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that Biden’s campaign team had told Fox News that he was “not free ” for an interview.
"In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic Group, Joe Biden, would plow in a similar situation," said Wallace.
"In the week, Biden's campaign asked for an interview and they said that the former vice president was not free."
"We keep asking each week," he added.
For months, Trump’s voting system has criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and a press conference while he attends interviews during the coronary virus epidemic.
Although Biden has recently begun his campaign again, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the vice president of the former ‘ hide ’ in his Delaware home.
However, begrudging Biden’s desire to attend public events has not been entertained by his presentation, as recent surveys show that Biden has a good lead on Trump, both nationally and in the main combat countries.
Averages of Real Clear Politics indicate that the president was down 7 percent in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2, Michigan, and 6.4, Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 as he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the White House battle.
In Fox News Poll’s latest survey, Biden has a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, with no scruples in any case.
Studies also indicate that Biden has a slight advantage in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important fighter states in these elections.
And the studies indicate that a formerly solid republic of the Republic, such as Texas and Georgia, is now divided between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which the President-in-Office invites him to attend a second election period in the White House are often votes for the President – and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trump and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the coronary virus and the economy, which is depleted by the epidemic — and the performance and history of the President in both cases.
Kanye West and His Wrestling at Twist
Today, musician Kanye West apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for having fallen into a state of atrocities.
The head of a mental - health professional thinks he is seeking his creative power, but a mental - health professional says it’s important that people take drugs to keep the disease in check.
Not only is the rapper Kanye West one of the most original and influential musicians of the time, but he is even more famous as a husband of Kim Kardashian’s real - life star.
His personal life has been much ahead of open tents.
When he announced early in that month that he was beautifying himself to the president of the United States, he gave an emotional and undisclosed speech.
Later, a few peculiar moments appeared from him on Twitter, claiming, among other things, that his wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show their husband and family understanding; he was having bipolar disorder; and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
He has since apologized to her publicly.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people will be deformed.
Ferdinand Jonsson, head of a mental - health clinic in London, knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so much depression for individuals and especially their families and loved ones.
This mahogany or mania can ruin relationships and work and cause tremendous sorrow.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say this.
And it's just human and human," said Ferdinand.
The head of Gehjälpar, the son of Unnstein, has himself struggled with bipolar disorder — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very cheerful imagination.
If we are four strands of earthly counterparts, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he's so superstitiously creative, superstitiously powerful, and clearly connected, because you'll be aware of this connection that we've been able to try to get into a state of man as well as we know it."
Kanye West doesn't want to take drugs, because he thinks they're pulling off his creative gift.
He's been discussing the bipolar disorder, including the Ye record.
Her brain says it's his choice not to take drugs.
“Many people feel that this element of creation is rooted in this unbridled connection and the superstitious creative power of the fire he has, but then the natural flaws of that often are great suffering, and the number of centuries and dark cellars and darkness.”
However, Ferdinand says it is important that people with bipolar disorder are treated.
“ If you have a lot of manpower or mania, you’re not making a wonderful thing, you’re just on the side.
And like when people suffer from severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you'd advise Kanye West to take medication?
"Consequently," says Ferdinand.
“And especially to work with someone to find the right dosage and this way to balance the medicine with the greatest help, and destroy what is remembered for him and his abilities and his creative power.”

Delhi Metro drops the first pillar at the fourth stage of the project
Delhi Metro reached an important stage in the fourth stage of the project when the first pillar was cut for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being laid, according to the staff on Sunday.
The pillar was poured in Keshopur and on an elevated portion between Keshopur and Mucarba Chowk on Saturday night.
‘Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) stepped up another important step at the fourth stage of the project is the first pillar at this stage of the extension of the train system was plunged by the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg,” said DMRC.
In spite of a considerable lack of capacity and other organizational challenges caused by the pandemic, according to employees, this “high priority” was achieved.
The average height of the pillar along this route is 10 meters.
On the other hand, the pillars will be 20 meters high at Madhuban Chowk, where the road will intersect at 1st and 25 meters at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the road will follow 2nd.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the bridge road will be 28 meters high, which is the highest floor in the history of Dehli Metro.
The highest point of the train system is standing at Dhaula Kuan, where the bridge road leads 7 close to 23.6 metres [23.6 m].
In the context of construction engineering, pillars are verticalally load - bearing structures that support the adjacent end of two pathways.
They form a vertical structure that carries up the elevated bridgeways of the reading system.
These reading towers can be seen on the countless highways under the subway tracks of Delí.
The number of pillars now plays an important role in the search for people in the Deli Big City area.
The 28.92 km long route from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is an extension of the Magenta route and 22 stops.
20 miles [21.18 km] from the road will be raised, and 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction work for this part began in December last year.
On July 17, work started on the subway section of the road when it began to build a mobile wall at Krishna Park Extension train station.
On 24 June, DMRC began to increase U-cartilage bites, which would later be placed in the elevated part of the route.
In the fourth stage of the project, 61,679 km of the new train will be provided for three different routes with 45 train stations.
These new parts will offer links between the part of the train system already operated by Delhi Metro.
Of these, 2,335 miles [22.35 km] will be below the surface, while other parts will be elevated.

"The paranoid" ambassador wants a gun, a armored car and a stun vest - said the subversives are the ambassadors of the "deep state"
The political order of the U.S. ambassador here in the country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to want to carry guns in CBS news today.
First, CBS said: “Despite being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been “weaning ” for his safety since he arrived in Reykjavík last year. ”
Indices CBS in 12 diplomata, a board of directors, and former representatives, as well as individuals familiar with the matter.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they wish permission from the ambassador to march paranoidly armed in this country.
He should also have wished for an armored car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and a stun vest.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to express itself as to whether there was any threat to the security of the ambassador, but the U.S. government representatives said that the ambassador had been told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
However, according to CBS, a bodyguard would have been advertised in Icelandic newspapers and would be able to meet the ambassador’s requirements.
CBS’ report states that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on CBS.
However, according to the U.S. authorities, the U.S. news agency has here on this country that no request has been received from the governments of that country.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of as walking around armed because it would offend the guest state, Iceland.
The ambassador had his dignity to pay for his rich support of Donald Trump’s 2016 election fund.
Previously, he was a skin doctor in California.
Since his arrival in May, Gunter said that he had created an “impossible ” work environment at the embassy and has already had seven subordinates, the so - called Deputy Chief of Mission, the ambassador’s subordinates, who are at the same time sent diplomats.
All of them were experienced diplomas from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador “because he did not look upon his appearance. ”
Had already been preparing for a year and learning Icelandic.
The next one only lasted six months.
Subsequently, the rotation of employees was built and the idea was to let Gunter show up as most people until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was in the interest of the delegation’s staff to take the lead in the “deepness ” and to have buried him in Washington, D.C., against the U.S. Department.
The Department of Foreign Affairs of D.C. said that they were well - aware of the situation of their mission in Reykjavik, but were reluctant to intervene in the lack of control of the embassy in view of Gunters ’ relationship with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulty following the foreign ministry’s orders in Washington, and he is said to have refused to return to D.C. during the Covid-19 epidemic.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for several months.
When he said he intended to work from his home in California, except by the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Flip on & Y Axis

That month, his new subordinate, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country.
CBS has not received any answers to their requests to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The Department of Foreign Affairs would not communicate with CBS, nor with the DV request.

The dispatcher in South Africa has also issued a warrant for running his number two and then trying to assign her son to the job.

Poland will report on the European Convention for the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Polish government states that the country will withdraw from a European Convention to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legal act of the world, which aims to prevent violence against women, but the Polish Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “harmful” as requiring schools to teach children about sex from a sociological point of view.
About the weekend, Ziobo said that on Monday he would begin to prepare a formal process of telling himself about the contract.
“This is an ideological part of the strategy for changing education in schools and leisure, for learning, thinking and persuasion of young Polish generations, for the reason that we believe it is wrong, that biological sex is old-fashioned and that everything really revolves around social culture.”
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the agreement on the education of children and young people as well as family ties in the context of the LGBT are unacceptable.
"We also include the LGBT component in the discussion on family ties, because this is an opinion held by the left actors or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to be binding," he said.
On Sunday, the Council of Europe said that it was “anxious” for Poland to consider telling itself about the agreement.
On Friday, Warsaw protested about 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, besides the offices of the right - hand associates, Ordo Luris, who supports the country’s surrender of the treaty.
“We won’t be victims, ” they called it.
Objection was also expressed in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and approved it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, engineer at the House of Honor, dead 81 years old.
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a quarter - mile - mile - race empire that includes his father Lee and his brother Richard, who was the first engineer to enter the Nascar Palace, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While his other family members were praised for their abilities behind the wheel, Maurice Petty won the nickname “The Leader ” for his talent with the key.
He helped his family to win 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR, and also built machines to secure the Victory of the Hall of Honor Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
"The boss was one of the most skilled mechanics in NASCAR's history," said the manager and manager Jim France.
“ He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises to achieve his excellence in the field of sports.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed various roles behind the tent and did what was necessary to get his cars on the track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the racetrack when he was little, and his knowledge of machine power soon became a major factor in landing Lee Petty in the 54 competitions and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup between 1960 and 64, was seven times in the top five seats, and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what is happening under the hood rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a success for his older brother, who relied on his machines for his victory.
Richard, then called the King, won the first championship with the Director in 1964 with the Plymouth driver.
They defeated again in 1967, then two consecutive years in 1970 and 1971, reaching three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their back, they share the record in most titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and contributed to the process of building one of the NASCAR top teams at Petty Enterprises,” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty’s victories are recorded as 212, he’s entitled to well over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The boss will be remembered forever as the best hardware in NASCAR history."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife at 52 years of age, died in 2014.
He was also a former driver’s cousin, Kyle Petty, and Trent Owens, co-pilot of the truck race.
“Even though we say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and successful pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be preserved in our memories, kept on the air and preserved forever,” said Kelley.
"We sent our deepest condolences to the Petty family."

Serbia wants to increase the number of military aircraft in the Balkans.
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military planes as tension increases in the Balkans, said Serbia’s president on Sunday.
President Alexander Vucic said that “certain attempts ” were being made to buy fleets of fighters, accusing the United States and other Western states of arming neighboring Serbia, which is in NATO, as well as Kosovo, formerly based in Serbia.
“The Americans, the Germans and the Germans take good care of their loved one, ” Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently given Kósovo a number of armored cars to the security forces.
During a tour of the Serbian Army’s tanker, Vucic told his people that he could not compete with NATO’s “proposals for neighboring arms ” and that“ that is why we are up to ourselves. ”
Although Vucic did not specify the type of Serbian military aircraft that was intended to be purchased, its government’s media say that its government has publicly wished for 20 U.S. air raiders.
It is stated that no response from Washington was received at the request of Belgrade and that if rejected, it is likely that an attack aircraft of the type Sukhoi-25 from Russia will be bought.
Serbia, which maintains a policy of neutrality in military matters, has recently been provided with a highly advanced air - protection system from Russia, which has also provided jets of battle, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also a Serbian allied nation, has delivered the country to serve as a military force.
U.S. officials have openly discussed the issue of sanctions against Serbia if more weapons spread to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the security of neighbouring NATO Member States.
In the West and in neighboring Serbia, people are anxious about the arms of Russia and China in Serbia.
The tension is now rising in the Balkans, where civil war was fought in the 1990 ’ s.
The Atlantic Alliance had a trade-off from Serbia to stop the blood-stained operations of Serbia against the Kósovo-Albana apartheid in 1999.
Despite the formal efforts made to join the European Union, Serbia’s populist leader has further strengthened his political and military relations with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: This fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study indicates that certain good things could be good for the heart muscle.
And how could this reduce the likelihood of a heart attack?
Scientists have made a meta-analysis of coronary artery disease that covers more than five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary heart disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and excessive shortness of breath.
“Success contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and steric acid, which can reduce inflammations and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high - density lipoprotein, collects “bad” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart — and carries it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low-fat protein) is broken down in the liver and then eliminated from the body.
However, the new study does not investigate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, lactose or other cocoa jams.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that the consumption of cocoa (found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoid found in chocolate reduces blood pressure and improves vascular function.
Vascular activity means how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients around the body and carries waste away.
Life-style factors were not mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who admitted to eating chocolate are more likely to have healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stress.
"Each of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system," she added.
Coles trades plastic toys out of books in a new campaign of collecting announcements
“ We have really listened, and there was a key point in the preparation of a project, ” said Ronson.
“We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books — we think they’ll want them, but they can recover them if they want to. ”
Ronson said that the new campaign has been in progress long before the COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the epidemic, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “something good ” because of how much time parents are now spending with their children.
The analysts have expressed concern that consumers have become tired of ever - increasing toy collecting campaigns of the largest supermarkets, but Ronson says there is no evidence of fatigue yet.
"We haven't seen anything like this yet, but we have our eyes open to this," she said.
“We report a lot of data, from week to week, months to months, to ensure that what we find out is consistent with our customers.
It was Cloes who ran the road for collecting campaigns such as the Little Shop in Australia, but the first in mid-2018 was the driving force behind the best four-year sales of the major market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed up with Lion King Osheis, who also helped the big market to increase its sales, and the last of them is the environmentally friendly presentation campaign of Discovery Garden to customers on free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new campaign could have less impact this time, as UBS analysts predicted an increase in sales in the Australian supermarkets in the largest part of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said customers can expect more diverse collection campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be less frequent.
“ It’s a lot about collecting campaigns around the world that we’re looking at, and we keep getting inspiration from other countries, ” she said.
"We need to do so to ensure that we do more and more with our customers."
5 laps around the country this summer
The photographer and material manufacturer Jon Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less frequent in Iceland since the outbreak of the epidemic.
John completed a study in business studies at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but he is now working on traveling and producing marketing materials for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early with Joni, or in April, when he traveled all over the West and stayed in his car.
For the rest of the year, he has gone about five or six laps around the country.
In addition, he has made countless daily trips here and there.
What has happened?
“ For someone like me who's always wandering and who's seen everything, it's hard to mention a favorite place.
There is more to the weather and the company that matters.
After the opening of the roads in June, a great deal has recently gone up to the highlands.
These journeys are always based on the fact that getting to the destination is so much adventure.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together on 5 big cars up by Riverside and from there to Lake Elf."
What's up with you this summer?
“I’m very excited about this, but I just finished my scuba diving course with DIVE and now take a scuba diving trip here and about Iceland.
Then I was adding a surfboard to my 'dot case' so I'll be more out in the sea than before.
So I’m heading for a ten - day solo trip with everything I need my back, but it’s gonna show up later in the summer.
Otherwise, I'll be high up in the highlands in the near future, as it's not possible to look at that area all year round."
What's your favorite place in Iceland?
“ It’s always hard to pick a place, but the Jakull Lion has been a part of my life since I remember.
My family and I spent each summer in a residence at the roots of the Broad Sign Ocean, and since then I have always enjoyed that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there over 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but it’s: the Mulacans in the South, the East Pole, the Aldeyjarfoss in the North, the Red sands in the West, the Snowflakes in the West, and last but not last...
What is essential in the journey?
“I don’t go to the country unless I have the following in the car: good flashlights, hangars, lopapeys, hunting knives, fireplaces, refrigerators, and eggbits... those who know me know what I’m talking about.”
Seeking 24 rescuers who are afraid of drowning off an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPÚR, Malaysia (AP) — On Sunday the authorities in Malaysia said they were looking for 25 rowing refugees who were afraid of drowning after disembarking from the tourist island of Langkawi, north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - ranking officer of Malaysia’s National Sanctuary, said that the first information from the police revealed that only one of the rowing men 25 who had jumped off the boat had been permitted to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late on Saturday and has been detained while the case is being investigated, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim rowers have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the people in Malaysia, who have been frequented by boatmen who promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and aviators were used to search.
He said that the National Sanctuary will also alert the local and governmental authorities in the neighboring Thailand to assist them in their search.
He didn't provide any further information about the boat.
During the last month, the authorities in Malaysia captured 269 prisoners of tranquillity and found a body on board a boat suspected of being used in smuggling off the coasts of Langkawi, who admitted that he had been deliberately damaged so that he could not go back to sea.
Later, Malaysia’s National Sanctuary stated that the 269 individuals had been transferred from a larger ship with dozens of people who are thought to have died and that their dead bodies had been thrown into the sea.
The prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, said that Malaysia could not accept any more peacemakers, since it is facing economic problems because of its chronic epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live in addition to some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 refugees — who are registered with the United Nations Organization of Refugees.
People in Aswan collect, watch, and return a shipment of chocolate to Sudan after a car crash
On the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the streetfront of the village of Wadi Karkar, the driver fell into a coma.
The villagers grouped to help the driver where he was lying and to save the product that had been stolen.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position so that the driver was “walking past our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where it comes from."
He added that the villagers had taken an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the truck’s cargo, estimated at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr told the villagers that they had been on the scene from morning till evening and saved as much of their cargo as they could.
“ The most important thing we felt was to save the driver’s life, protect the cargo, and open the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the wrecked driver with water and shelter, said Bahr, adding that they just wanted to make sure he was safe and secure from the village.
There were already criminals at the Congress, and the coronary virus could make them worse.
“The epidemic of the world alone calls on our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of difficulty,” says a report prepared by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“But we are also faced with other liabilities that concern the inherited sin of our people and the racial disorder that has affected our country from its founding. ”
The study examines familiar materials related to the pitiful situation of the Congress: lack of real links between classes, agenda limiting communication opportunities, over-compilation of power in leadership positions, constant demands for funding, reports on inter-group cooperation, negative impact of the daily working media, the fact that the most important elections to Congressmen are often pre-elections and finally the silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that the council will move more into the world because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows elections with the help of council members without Congressmen having to travel to Washington, could add to the problems that exist.
If the idea of a teleconference reaches a foothold, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase communication between groups, as the report states.
“The epidemic of the world was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“But even though this was necessary, it should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the council “needs more than less communication between the members of the council, face - to - face. ”
They need to study each other's districts better, have courteous conversations to find common ground, and build a relationship based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The appeal for courtesy was particularly valid in the week when Ted Yoho, the representative of the Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the senator of the Democratic Party of New York with the words and his companions of the Rebino group, agreed to attack Liz Cheney, the senator of the Republiks in Wyoming with hostile words.
Congresswoman Val Demings talks about the vice president's office, tells Trump to hear it for graces.
The Congresswoman Val Demings (Democrats, Florida) was not ashamed to discuss his interest in serving as Vice-President of the potential Joe Biden government and to express sincere gratitude for being taken into consideration for his office.
This respected member of the BlackPressus group was interviewed by BlackPressusA on live broadcast for the #FIYAH! live show and told about its history, energy and commitment that has brought it to its current location, and began with the words "You know all my history. I grew up as a daughter of a maid and a housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida".
Démings was one of the four prosecutors of the Senate in the Donald Trump court trial in the January issue of January.
Regardless of whether the elders condemn Trump, it will be recorded in history that he is the fourth president to be accused.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, the former director of the council of prosecutors was quoted as saying, “Was this worth it?
She added that despite its disappointment, democracy had been obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
During the interview, Demings made it clear that she opposed Trump’s arrest of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying before the Senate (including other crimes) as well as his deliverance from other criminals who were convicted of similar crimes, when she said: “The lack of jealousy of your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your indebtedness. ”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential proponents to vice presidents, who also hold Karen Bass President CBC (Democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former senator of Georgia, Senator Kamälu Harris (Democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (Democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms mayor Atlanta, Susan Rice former ambassadors of the United States, and a few others.
However, she noted that only one person would decide who would volunteer with Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she took her hand to her mouth while she laughed, whispering to those who watched the live broadcast, and added, “If you want to call... you can do it for me.”
There is no doubt that regardless of political views, history books view this period as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
This did not go unnoticed by Deming.
She noted that the number of women who make representations to the vice president of the United States is an opportunity to break through what is left of the “faced glass ” — especially for women of African origin.
“It’s exactly this opportunity that I work so hard at all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they’re of the wrong sex,” she said.
The congressman planned to ensure that the Democratic Party and the Biden National Committee would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“I will call Tom Perez (the chairman of the Democratic Group’s National Committee) and I will put this at the top of my list,” Demings promised.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she replied to the former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial saying that the President is preparing to reach himself, lived over Deming: “To the point of reaching myself, I would be hurt. ”
“ But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to break the law and ignore the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he hates losing.
I can absolutely believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who let it happen."

Alibaba and Jack Ma go to trial in Gurugram for an ex-employee
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been sued in Gurugram after the company’s former employee claimed that he had been charged with protesting literature and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is addressed in Gurugram’s district court, and Sonia Sheokand has published a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others, asking them to attend court on July 29, according to the news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, is committed to 268,000 U.S. dollars in damages, according to court papers.
“We are committed to the domestic market and to the well-being of its employees and are in line with current legislation.
We can't express ourselves about the current proceedings," said UC India in a declaration.
'The application also contains the 'list of sensitive words', which contains the password of Hindus and English, such as 'the border between India and China' and 'the war between China and India', which is stated in the complaint that UC Web uses to write material on its systems in India,' according to Reuters.
During the last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese mobile phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
Agent New York City Fire Department says it is "totally" okay to exclude a white fireman from the honorary
According to a recent report, a representative on the issue of diversity in the New York City fire department says that it is “totally” that a white fireman should be held back from duty so that all of them can be black.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has raised issues of racial discrimination after he was removed from a group of flagbears at a memorial Mass in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a brotherhood of black firefighters.
The chief fire extinguisher in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, also called for the decision to be taken in the New York City Court of Human Rights, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in the department who, in a story - telling form, sees the American flag at Ground Zero on the days of the September 11th attack.
According to McWilliam's dear friend, the fire department had chosen him to be alone in the honor of the flag bears at the memorial.
Being a flagbearer at this ceremony was a "great honor and privilege" for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN case law.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was forbidden to participate in the honorary guard of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for it was claimed that she had asked that all flag bears at the Mass would be black.
She then asked McWilliams, a 29-year-old New York City firefighter, to help in another way."
Among the claims that she asked him to do so is to escort civilians and to set up firefighters who were wearing uniforms away from the Mass.
McWilliams claimed in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honorary guard because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has served at the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on September 11th, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams asserted that he had left the memorial “to spare himself from further shame, humiliation and shame, ” when friends and associates heard what happened between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, who is black, witnessed in court, the lawyer McWilliams, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “So, praying that everyone is black in honor is not a difference? ”
"No, it isn't," said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was all right to ask that everyone be black in honor, which she replied, “Absolutely. ”
Promise explained that it would be all right for a white person to replace a black person to “give up our speciality and different backgrounds to create pride, consensus, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed for discrimination based on race at the New York City Fire Department in January 2018.
He then brought a case against Wilson, New York City firearm, New York City, and non-computed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed his plea, Wilson’s supporters would have avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams and said: “I’ve heard of you, they told me you would behave like this, and now you know who I am. ”
In a lottery, Sullivan wrote that excluding McWilliams from the honorary sword at the fair would have been “deployable ” and a sign that one thing was not true for everyone at the fire department.
"If you are a black person and a difference between a white person at the workplace, you will be reminded at most," said Sullivan.
Wilson received “one hour counseling ” under the law because of her treatment with McWilliam.
Meanwhile, Sullivan wrote, a white person who discriminates against a black person “serious punishment. ”
"The New York City Fire Department has created a policy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan society who behave in a racist manner, excuse their actions and assist them ... and this must be stopped," wrote Sullivan.
Threatened a walker and demanded money
One person was arrested in the city after an attempted robbery, threatening a walking roadman and trying to obtain money from the person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Then the police were notified of a man with a knife in the middle of town.
The knife was confiscated, and the report was taken from the person.
About eighty cases came in on the police board the capital area from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m., and this morning six were stored in a prison cell.
One of the things that stopped the police was the driver who pulled a trailer on Kjalarnesi, where the trailer was in a very bad condition.
The wheelchair was seated and intended to be provided by the owner of a transporter to move it to town.
Police then stopped the drug production in the Yearbook.
Two were arrested for the matter and were released after the report had been completed.
There was also an announcement about people who shot up fireworks in the Yearbook.
They had been out of the scene when police came to the scene “still probably knew their shame, where there is still a lot of time in the years. ”
Thousands of Khabarovsk people are still demanding absolution from Putin
The Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday led thousands of civilians to protest the arrest of the district governor in the same region south of East Russia and the insertion of his successor, who has never lived in the region.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoys great popularity, and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and taken to Moscow’s custody earlier this month, accused of ordering murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
In the past week, Furgal was formally appointed as district governor and his 39 - year - old brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, to replace him, with little regard for the locals.
When Degtaryev said inexperienced and, worse still, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the citizens after his report the fastest.
They've called Degtaryev to blow the ears.
Yesterday’s protesters were less than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
"We want the district governor released, because we believe his arrest is very likely to be illegal," says Alina Slepowu, half a Protestant, the AFP news agency.
She claims that the Kremlin’s agents had Furgal arrested “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the region. ”
The Khabarovsk police left protesters uninvited despite the fact that the claim was a clear violation of the current ban on the Korean virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met on Pushkin Square to show protesters in Khabarovsk support in action, says the report of the British Guardian.
Furgal's group, Russia's Liberal Party, is a group of hard-line internationalists, and is considered by political commentators to be quite loyal to the Kremlin government in most cases.
The same political commentators, on the other hand, inform the BBC that Furgal’s victory in the district election two years ago — great and undisputed — had been a major shock to Putin and the United States, while pointing out that Kremlin’s conquest in the East was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he is awaiting trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were gone: but the third went out.
Sarah Rainsford, secretary of the BBC in Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who enjoy high popularity at home, are convinced that the charges and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why governments have waited for him to be arrested until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged crime.
Tree branches gave themselves up when the hurricane Hanna rode over South Texas
The hurricane Hannah fell to the power of a tropical storm after he landed on the coasts of southern Texas on Saturday, July 25, but the government warned that the storm could still cause dangerous rapids.
The U.S. Weather Office said that the greatest threat to the south of Texas and the northeastern part of Mexico was as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter and told Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless Women with Disabilities Participate in the Fight Against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is educated as a dresser, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid infected area in Chennai, where about 10,000 cases have been reported.
Work starts early at her, 7:30, and ends at 4:16.
It measures the warmth of the population, asks for symptoms, and teaches them the importance of using masks, washing hands regularly, and keeping them away from others.
In fact, her work has resulted in the detection and treatment of infectious diseases over time in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 people in Chennai City who care for the home screens but are not healthcare professionals.
According to the government, the project has contributed to a 50 - percent reduction in positive cases, in daily Chennai, while increasing in other regions of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all residents cooperate.
She adds: “Fews are cooperative when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
Some, though, become irritated.
This is not to worry about.
I think people should be able to be safe.
When I come back next day, the people are polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the gistty of the city for women with disabilities and fight against Covid-19.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has disabilities, has also participated in the campaign as an overseer.
Although Kavitha does not have a specially designed bicycle, she walks to meet people and holds her high ground.
“ I’m happy, ” she says of a reduction in infection, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can reach it."
On the first floor of the gistitol, where the two live, Matilda Funceca, a basketball player using a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, send all the data from about 40 women to a Chennai-city web server.
Matilda is not afraid to be infected with the corona virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When asked what steps she is taking, Manimekalai says: “I use a mask, keep away, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sit-ha drink that enhances the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived in Chennai, these women guarded their time and abilities in sewing a mask for health - care professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the Gistyl, as well as the Dorcas research station that runs the shelter, says: “They adapt to the needs of each hour.
Previously, masks were missing, and they did not leave behind.
Now there's an intervention in society, and then they answered the call."
Coronary virus transmission in Tamil Nadu is now 200,000 after a new 6989 - day incident, but it is also the highest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died, and 7758 have recovered over the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the country is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find the last journey of a teenager in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of a teenager in Helensburgh are now trying to put together a timeline for his last journey.
The 19-year-old Kirk Allan found his body at Johnson Court at 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged with death.
He'll be in court at Dumbarton on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our mind is with Kirk’s family and friends in these difficult times.
Policemen will continue to work with society and support it.
Our research continues to focus on getting a full picture of what happened, especially the last days of Kirk's death, but we're not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox share their experiences of differences
In the last few weeks, it has been known that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial rights in sports in South Africa.
In order to welcome everyone in sports, upbuilding conversations must take place and take action.
Ashwell Prince, former protea’s cricket star, told his former white teammates and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black teammates were “vote players. ”
Prince said that Protea’s black players were publicly known as the “female players ” of their white associates.
He added that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada were still associated with the quota discussion, it would be sad to note that some people still received the highest standards in the sport.
Prince, now coach of the Cape Cobras team, made these remarks fall to the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The organization’s goal is to continue to discuss historical racial rights in South African sports.
“ As I said when I was lightening up on community media, it’s not my intention to come and bring people’s names down to the area, but these are real events...
"You're doing everything right, but you're getting infected."
Paul Roberts, a former musician and a designer who became a NASA programmer, is now working at a software company.
He and his wife, an ex-sister at the Methodist Hospital who views himself as a optimistic person, held out an amateur magazine online and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they're paired with two of their daughters, a son-in-law and a 7-year-old granddaughter, playing a huge Uno game.
“ They are amazing nerds, ” says Roman, 38 years old, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic — she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a stent that previously holds a blocked coronary artery open.
"We've been so careful, very careful, and we've kept away from people," said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband started working from home in the spring, when the epidemic fought hard on Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to the big market during “old times, ” and the only real date of their last month was Sheryl when they started looking at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also cautious.
But then she came sneezing home from work one day in the middle of June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she developed cough, fever, headache, and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the coronary virus.
"She said, "I don't know what's going on, Mom, but I was wearing a mask, I had gloves, washed my hands," said Sheryl.
"You do everything right but get infected anyway."
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive coronavirus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation became much worse for her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began sneezing and then coughing, just like their daughter, and then got a fever and a lot of pain in their body.
Then he became “very sick, very soon, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
She worried about his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency reception, for the second time in two days.
The royal couple formerly felt that they were “skinned ” in the Queen’s Christmas House, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprins found his grandmother, Queen of the United Kingdom, to have ‘ nursed ’ them in their Christmas home.
The couple’s new life story, entitled “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were overlooked by those in the collection who could see in the Christmas feast.
Pictures on the desk with which the queen sat showed, among other things, the William of Bretaprin, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprins, and his wife Kamilla, as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see despite Archie’s birth in May, yet the boy was mentioned as her Majesty’s “eighteen grandson. ”
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton were “never friends, ” since they“ had difficulty in getting over superficial courtesy ” and met only several times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and his brother Vilhjälm had begun some years before his relationship with Meghan began but had reached a peak because of Vilhjälm’s and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “variant ” on events with his brother and Kate Middleton, claiming that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came into existence. ”
Congressmen of the League accuse labor leaders of wanting to keep public officials “world forever. ”
Congressmen of the League accuse labor leaders of wanting public workers to be “world forever ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s appeal that people return to work
The presidents were accused of wanting workers “to stay at home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s appeal to people to return to work.
The councillors were angry when the unions of public and public employees told their associates to resist when their superiors ordered them to return to their places of employment.
Andrew Percy, a former minister, said “unacceptable ” that the necessary public services such as the issue of passports would be stopped while employees in the general market had worked hard to keep society walking in the coronary epidemic.
“It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while workers in warehouses and factories around the country have continued to work so that public employees can eat during this time,” he said.
“ Many of these workers now want to go on vacation but cannot do so because of the people who refuse to go back to their places of employment, even if they are safe.
Trade union leaders cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially not now when we know that people can return to work in a safe way."
After a call from the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed head of government, announced that a government would “remove from working at home in public service and speed up their return to their places of employment until August 1. ”
The public and public workers’ association told their associates, who number some 200,000, that they would not have to meet this requirement, and that this was political.
A spokesman for the public and public trade union, the largest trade union of public employees in the United Kingdom, said that the demand for a return to work places was “not put ahead with the health and safety of our fellow workers, or to strengthen the economy.
This is done solely because of political pressure from the councillors who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to our associates is clear: If you do your job at home and someone in your department asks you to return to work, do not take what you need to do, of course."
The dispute is rooted in growing dissatisfaction with late versions of passports because employees work at home, but some 400,000 people are now said to wait for their applications to be processed.
The Ministry of the Interior has now published that it will be “temporary” requests from the United Kingdom for travel over the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport for more than four weeks.
Public and public employees have admitted that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports but insist that “small and often narrow offices ” make 4,000 staff members of the passport service difficult to maintain the necessary distance.
The former government minister, David Davis, urged the leaders of trade unionists to “keep their senses ” and seek cooperation with governments to get people back into their places of work.
He added that if he were in government, he would ask a labor leader: “What is it you want? That people stay home all summer? ”
However, a number of Britain’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to people to return to work.
A study of larger workplaces with a total of about 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their places of work.
The emphasis on history can play an important role in reconciliation
The gift has widened, but understanding and contentment should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching article specifically dealing with our history — the 'Saga Australia' for 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in the Victorian Republic completed a study in Australia of a total of 49,324 who completed primary schooling, or just 1%.
For the past six years, this number has almost halved, but nearly 100 fewer students enroll in the course each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th - grade history is that in previous years, little has been done to arouse their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the wider “consultation. ”
This is why students in 7th and 8th grade only completed one short unit on the "earthquake and island marshes on Torres Strait and their culture".
In the 9th and 10th years, there is another unity about Australia during World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, these are all the teachings of Australia’s history during elementary school years.
During the 9th and 10th years, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save an Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, history needs to become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is taught only as part of intellectuals, it has little room in the study book.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in thought science but have not been educated in history.
Historical skills, such as the analysis of information, are complex.
We must employ more specialized historians to ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, from 1788 to 1914, the history of Australia will become a duty.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, since they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not bridge deep gulfs between races.
But without it, as can be clearly seen in the Victorian curriculum, the project is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a member of the Congress of Victorian Parliament and former assistant director Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aron Elís in the European Council finals - Iceland divided by half
Aron Elís Thråndarson has come to the finals on Europe’s seats in the Danish high school football league.
Isaac Bergmann Johnson played only the first half with the top team Norrköping against Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aron Elis was a member of OB in Denmark when the team moved on to the European Union’s premise.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but it depends on whether the joints will end later this day after the final round of the Danish final round.
Aron Elis played the whole game in 1-1 matches with Horsens today, but OB had won the first game at home, 3-1 and won a total of 4-2.
Isaac was in the initial team of Norrköping, which was unexpectedly 2–0 below the previous half-game against Falkenberg base in the Swedish primeval section.
At the beginning of the second half of the game, Norrköping was one of those who had to resign.
Norrköping reached an even assessment, but Falkenberg reached 3–2 in 89 minutes.
Still, the time for Norrköping to get out of hell at the last minute was 3–3.
Norrköping is still at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which is playing for good later today.
Falkenberg was able to escape from the bottom for a while, but the people are leveled above Helsing and Kalmar, who have a good game.
Collecting Records of Coronary Time Celebrations
Anna Lilja Sigurdardóttir founded the Facebook group “My Year 2020 ” to gather literature on the next weekend’s celebration by the Islanders.
Many will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja had a conversation with "Wasta" on the weekend of the Wave.
“Nothing has yet come in that is very exciting also because there are 600 people in the group so that they are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
There's something about the islanders having tent parties at home in the park.
“ People have talked about being with their own [festival], perhaps camping in the park, and squabbling the family together like people always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect men to spend time with their people.
However, it is likely that many people will not be there “but still hold some small National Festival somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets that were bought, but Anna believes that many locals are more likely to make money for the next year’s festival.
"People are even investing in the tickets now and making 2021. "
“I’m a great festival man, I love the preparation and everything about it, but sometimes something comes into the life that you don’t control, and that’s just the way it is,” says Anna, “but it has been said that people ask whether the islanders can’t let go of the National Festival once. ”
Anna Lilja claims not to have set up the group for himself or to encourage people to celebrate their own National Festival but to gather literature on World War II in the islands this year.
“ What did people do at these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in something or anything, but then there's someone who uses such resources in something, but I was just creating some area where people can put in what it's doing."
At the same time, a fire has been brought up on the Poet’s base, which is lit every year.
“ I think many people are excited about getting burned on Friday night.
The only thing that makes a line in the account, of course, is that the prediction is nothing special."
“This burn will be lit, but it just has to show how it will be,” says Anna Lilja.
Anna Lilju can be listened to as a whole in the player below.
Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in new documents on sexual immorality?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court papers on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
U.S. judge has ordered that secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among these 80 pages of documents, Maxwell’s 2016 testimony is part of Maxwell’s 2016 edition.
The display of these pages could also put great pressure on Prince André, where they can find communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, a disgraced U.S. financier, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced to have a conversation with Prince Andrew.
Prince André is now preparing to defend the possible publication of information during the week, with even more damaging accusations of his friendship with the child abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his supposed accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
During the week before, U.S. District Justice Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The presentation of these vast documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, as they have a large part of it bearing witness to lawyers in 2016, including what their lawyers have said is “a curious question ” about her sex story.
They could also put great pressure on Prince André, who had one document to communicate between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sexual slave of the disgraced American financier, asserted in 2015 that she had been forced three times to have an agreement with André.
Andrew has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected these statements.
E-mails from the year 2015 leaked and BBC release last year seem to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for assistance in responding to Robert’s statements.
We are in no doubt that the duke will receive rebellion
There he told his wife: “Let me know when we can talk, and I have some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “I have information, so call me when you have an hour off. ”
Last night, a source standing near Andrew said: “The duke of Jorvik has done nothing wrong, so we are not worried about opening up a court order.
As courts in the United States have tried to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even if it appears in court documents.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care when handling the allegations presented in the court papers.
We totally agree with that.
We are in no doubt that the Duke will receive a full rebellion in the next weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody at Manhattan’s detention centre, waiting for a trial and seizing some of Epstein’s victims who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of being malicious about refusing to know about his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last discussed with lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s criminal code, which is now under Giuffre’s last name, which she mentioned after her marriage.
Some 40 pages of a total of 418 of these testimony were made public last year, but after the decision of Judge Presna in New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell had one week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was in custody for sexual assault.
Detectives are looking for a violent attack on the streets of Edinborg
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh, causing him an injury that could prove permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
Investigator Dale Miles, who conducts the study, said: “This was a violent and arbitrary attack. ”
The suspects fled towards Newtoft Street.
One was thought to be in its 30 ’ s, about 180 cm high and strongly grown.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in white shirts, dark trousers, and dark shoes.
Says Detective Miles: “I pray to all those in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious of presenting themselves. ”
The mailman wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Ambassador of the United States of Iceland, wants to carry a gun in this country and wants to increase security.
He was said to have been “weaningly ill ” about his safety since his arrival in the country last year.
This is stated in the CBS report, which also says that this is what Gunter wants, despite his being active in “one of the safest states in the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to hide from the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he's asked for an armored car and a vest that will protect him from knives.
CBS sources say the Board of Directors, although they have withdrawn, Gunter announced that he is not at risk in Iceland.
According to the CBS report, Iceland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not provide information as to whether a request was received from the United States for the possible armaments of Gunter, because the authorities did not express their views on the security measures of foreign nationals.
Even though no request was made, the news agency’s sources say.
Then CBS has it also after his sources said that Gunter should not be seeking to carry weapons, since he would be taken as an insult here on the land.
Gunter has been a California dermatologist for years.
He's active in the Republican Party of the United States, and he's a great supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently took note of the “Invisible China Virus. ”
CBS sources also say that Gunter was seriously affected by the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik.
He had already had seven second - term employees at the May embassy last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to “the deep kingdom, ” which is supposed to be a network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and was angry at the fact that one carried snow into his office.
The ambassador went to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS records.
Gunter is said to have wanted work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return and do it in May.
The home game form is a key point for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has an easier game to play when fans get to return to the game
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur hasn’t lost a game at home since the original department went back into operation, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good team at home if the audience were allowed to play.
Spurs has won 12 victories at home during this season, but he lost four times — only one of the six teams that are above them has lost more at home.
The coach Portuguese said that while such a victory would be possible without its supporters, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
"We have to do this with the fans. Without them you can build some kind of work, where the game plan is in the foreground," he said.
“But I think it’s much more powerful to do with the fans, because that adds to the emotional side of the game, which is next only with the help of fans at the home playground.”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it will be more and more difficult to maintain the long periods of victory he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up over the past three seasons.
However, this is also a key factor in determining whether the end of the period has reached its goals, especially in equal games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere of the field can change.
“I think the direction in the selection department is that now this unbalanced valuation is becoming increasingly difficult because of what has become good. ”
“This, however, is very important to be strong at home and at the end of the season, has entered many stages with victories at home. ”
“ I’m happy with the finals from home games recently, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I see victory against Arsenal with the ground full of Tottenham fans.
This is compassion that is built up gradually."
The buyers are excited about the lovely bank's life - style needs
“Better is better, ” apparently, is the motto of new owners of huge real estate in the Lovely Banks neighborhood, which was recently sold on a $1,270 Australian dollar.
Interesting buyers looking for lifestyle property near the center of Geelong managed to view these 1.35 hectares of land, where you can find car shelters for 14 cars, swimming pools and views of the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, a real estate agent in Harcourts, North-Geelong, said that an offer to the property that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of being placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back for sale
Home Ideal for Isolation
"We received a number of offers from various parties," said Grgic.
"The property was sold to a home very excited."
The property follows four rooms of two rooms, including a private bathroom large enough to sleep.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can make use of an up - to - date kitchen and an up - to - date area with a view over the pool.
"This was in the composition of the property, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place," said Grgic.
“ Interesting buyers from Melbourne came here, wondering what the property was in the middle of the country, but still living in a rural area.
“I have people who have missed and buyers who are still looking. ”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a stand - free shell that is equipped with 10-12 vehicles, would be perfect for industrial workers or to keep a trailer and a trailer.
Counting Security Threats in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed to the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since he came to Reykjavík last year.”
This is how CBS News on Ambassadors in Iceland begins, but this mimics a number of CBS publications from the U.S. Foreign Service.
The CBS report claims that Gunter requested the United States Department of Foreign Affairs to obtain a special permission from Icelandic government to carry firearms.
Then, too, he should have wished for an armored car, as well as for any ideas about a vest that might protect him from a knife - tongue attack.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunters' security is a real threat to Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently announced full-time lifeguards, including the last July 18th morning, but CBS reports that it is done to satisfy Gunter’s concerns.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express any serious security measures in connection with its mission, but it always states the objective of safety prevention.
The Office does not answer questions relating to Gunter’s desire to arm themselves and the Icelandic Department of Foreign Affairs does not want to tell whether the United States formally wished for the ambassador to carry firearms, or whether it would normally not express itself on the security issues of foreign agencies.
According to CBS, however, according to their Icelandic sources, that request has never been made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was given these plans as they could cause domestic abuse in Iceland.
The CBS review also discusses the various problems that have been addressed by the United States Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will already have replaced his host seven times.
Thus, the first deputy minister is said to have prepared for his job for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last moment because Gunter “does not listen to him ” at their first meeting.
His successors have not been much better controlled by Gunter.
Governments in the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs are told that they are aware of the position of the Embassy in Iceland, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters that are closely related to the President.
In addition, Gunter is said to be reluctant to follow the various rules of foreign service and to respect the rule of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to attend a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland afterwards and have his temporary place of employment for months, and so in the middle of a pandemic.
Gunter will even have wished to do his job in the distance and said he would not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically wished for it.
According to information from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take on a personal permit that the conference had ended and that the Coronary Virus epidemic had delayed further, but according to CBS’s records, many within the Council had asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but that he had not done so until May, after Pompeo had contacted him and asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
The CBS review also reported the unpopular nature of Gunters in Iceland, especially in connection with the season in which he called the “Invisible China Virus” and has been highly criticised.
Gunter is one of many, virtually inexperienced ambassadors in the field of foreign service who have been appointed during Donald Trump’s reign.
Sachin Pilot v. Ashok Gelot; Bharatiya Janata team says government crisis in the state; Congress Party wants vote
Ashok Gelot said that if needed, the Congress would have to attend a meeting outside the home of the prime minister.
On Saturday, the day after peaceful protests against Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gelot, prime minister of Rajasthan, said that if necessary, the Congressmen would have to meet the president and to meet the funds for a meeting outside the president’s home to bring the crucifix to the end.
At the Congressional meeting, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote in order to check whether the majority of the members of the assembly and the cohabiting forces were with him in the power struggle.
"He told the government that he had the majority and wanted to receive a vote," said Mahesh Joshi, main group member of the Congress, after the meeting.
The convention was held at a hotel where the councillors who support Gehlot have stayed in the last days.
“ The minister asked us to be prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If it had to, he said, he would meet the President and also hold peaceful protests outside the home of the Prime Minister," said a leader.
Prime Minister Rajasthan may convene the assembly and let the Congressional Party demonstrate its majority, said council leader Rajal Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata group had come up with the advice to overthrow Ashok Gelot's government.
“The country is now governed by laws and regulations.
Governments are formed and employed by the authorities of the people.
It has become apparent that Bharatiya Janata's policy of overthrowing the Rajasthan government has been called into question.
This is an insult to 80 million people of Rajasthan.
The prime minister must convene the assembly to bring the truth before the land," said Gandhi in a rush to the Hindu.
Minister Rajasthan, Ashok Gelot told Congressmen on Saturday that he was ready to meet the President of India to ensure that what he calls “the plot of Bharatiya Janata” of delaying the declaration of confidence by a vote of vote will not succeed.
Gehlot, who protested for hours at the home of the governor of Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press for a meeting, met with Congressmen and government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were made and approved by government.
Last night, Mishra asked Gehlot to reintroduce the meeting and referred to six objections.
It will soon be sent to the governor.
Ghlot has accused the governor of delaying the Congress meeting as he is “under pressure ” to delay the vote that determines trust in his government.
When Gelot met his government, the delegation of Bharatiya Janata, head of the government of the government of the government of Gulab Chandra Kataria, led by the government of the province of COVID-19, met with the government.
Fired in a car just outside of Burgarnes
A traffic was required when a car was set on fire just above the Hamar golf booth at Borgarnes just before four o’clock.
According to Borgarnesi, the fire extinguished the fire in the car and is now waiting for it to be removed.
Two were in the car when the fire started due to technological failure in the passenger car, both of them safe and completely safe.
The traffic had to be controlled during firefighting, but heavy traffic in the area is in both directions.
The player Spencer Grammer was given a ditch outside the restaurant in Manhattan.
NEW YORK – The playwright Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm the hottest man when he cut her arm and stuck her friend in the back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, 36, said that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation that they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting in front of the Black Ant at the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan at 23:30.
on Friday, when a man came up to them and demanded payment, when he was shutting down the restaurant.
Grammer and her friend were wounded when they tried to “solve disagreements between an unknown man and other visitors at the scene, ” says the police.
The man ran off after hurting Grammer's right arm and stabbing her friend in the lumbar spine with an unknown tipped object, said a police officer.
No one's been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks for Summer in the parts 'Rick and Morty' and played previously in the series 'Greek' at ABC Family, is the daughter of 'Frasier' star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both her and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded in the field and the Bellevue Hospital staff who listened to them and referred to the “unbelievable struggle” of these staff at the coronal epidemic.
“It really touched us to get a chance to thank them personally,” said Grammer.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic night on UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star of UFC after registering in the history of Fight Island, but he says he's not going to flag his fortune in a superstitious way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried the North-Iran Rhys McKee superintendent in their battles with a great shot at Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he won his competition when three minutes and 9 seconds were over from the first round by hitting him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name Chimaev in UFC history books for the shortest time between winnings in the modern history of the race, where only 10 days had passed since he defeated British John Phillips in a similar decisive way, then in the interim.
Chimaev, who has a winning ratio of 8-0, received 50,000 U.S. bonuses for tonight's performance against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now called "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be inescapable comparison because of the great odds between the superiority of Chimaev and the UFC champion in the light and where he was born in the Czech Republic, which is near to Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite newfound fame and financial gain, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not like to flag his wealth like Conor McGregor's MMA money machine or his peers in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t just do this for myself, I do it for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," said Chimaev when he was asked how he would use the bonus on Fight Island.
Among other things, he has noticed a team of Conor McGregor and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could “facilitably” win Chimaev with an output drive.
It was not a toxic answer from the fighter who came under the name of 'Borz', or 'wolf' in his native Tetenian, who said that he would 'paint Danis with his eyes closed'.
Chimaev, who now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country of 19 years of age, may have little to do with his financial power, but he is clearly indignant about evading his fighting skills.
“I can grind anyone...
How many fighters are in the welfare ward?
I can paint them all," he said.
“Give me 75 pounds [77 kg] of champion (breathy), 80 pounds [84 kg] of champion (mildly), and I'll grind them both the same day.”
Israel continues to oppose the response of prime minister to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested the prime minister of the land on Saturday and were the greatest protesters outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because the critics believe that the government's failure to respond to the siron virus epidemic has led to a halt to the threat of the virus.
Netanyahu, accused of corruption, has further promoted the protest.
"Bibi, go home," said one of the Protestants.
On the other hand, it said: “Everyone sees that Caesar has lost his clothes. ”
Also, hundreds of Protestants gathered outside the beach house of Netanyahu in the prosperous city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called rapid and unregulated reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases increased by day to 2000.
The economy of the country has been hit by the virus limitations and unemployment has increased to nearly 20%.
The protesters say that the government’s financial aid has little to do with it.
The protest took place in the shadow of a trial of corruption against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
Interviews begin in January.
He is accused of fraud, fidelity, and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of Protestants meet in downtown Los Angeles to demonstrate their support for Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — About 300 protesters met in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, focusing on federal police after protesting.
Similar Protestant meetings took place throughout the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group went to the police headquarters in Los Angeles on First Street and Main Street, and then to the maintenance center of the metropolitan area.
The participants also moved to the Alameda freeway on Route 101, but later left it.
Part of the people were seen breaking windows in federal buildings in the city center, and humiliating words were written on federal markings.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 people in the Mosques at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings at Eidgah, say the government of Karnataka
The festival Eid-ul-Acha, or Bakrid, will take place on July 31st and August 1st.
The Government of Karnataka has published that only 50 may convene in mosques for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned the prayer meetings at Eidgah and other locations for the corona virus epidemic.
Visitors who wish to pray in Mosque must wear masks and stay away, as instructed by AB Ibrahim, the Governing Board of Minority Groups and Wakf.
The order states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the Udup, Dakshina Kannada and Kodag, but on 1 August elsewhere in the state.
The order states that while prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be banned because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers will, however, be allowed in Mosques, provided that no more than 50 participate at once.
If there is more than that when prayer is exchanged, the agency says in the order.
Nowhere else, such as meeting homes, social centers, or the “Shadi Mahal, ” may prayer meetings be held.
The Karnataka government permits the opening of temples, mosques and other places of worship to those who wish to pray from June 8, to ensure that the protection of the disease is ensured by the COVID-19.
The U.S. ambassador wants an armed bodyguard.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Ambassador of the United States of Iceland, thinks his life is a threat to the country and wants to carry weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy announced in response to a lifeguard 'bodyguard' in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
On the basis of the report, the main reason why these jobs were announced is that Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life is threatened in Iceland.
There has been a series of discussions with Icelandic and foreign sources who are convinced by the ambassador that he is in great danger, and that is why he is Jewish.
What is the threat is not as clear as it is, but the correspondents of Fire said that the Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
The CBS TV station discussed the issue on its website this morning and reported to the Washington authorities that Gunter is a victim of persecution, insists on carrying his own weapons, getting an entire vest and armed escort as well as a bulletproof car.
According to CBS sources, Gunter has been withdrawn to state that there is no threat and that the "bodyguard" advertisement is only for Gunter's sleep.
On the basis of the facts, the positions had not been taken up in June, but the request was postponed to February.
According to the documentation on Fire, no formal notice has been received from the U.S. Embassy because of these changes.
No formal request has been made for increased care or for a permit for lifeguards to be armed outside the walls of the embassy.
It is clear from the Icelandic law that this is not permitted except with a special authority from the State Department.
There is no information available on any threat to the environment within the management system.
The latest threat to the state police is rather decisive in terrorist acts.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no indications that terrorist or extreme groups are working here.
The requirements for allowing the arms of a foreign embassy’s guards on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are not available, according to the documentation of Quaeks.
Gunter paid considerable attention here in the country when he divided the tenth president of the United States and called the COVID-19 "China Virus".
At that time, he had the American and Icelandic flag.
A broadcaster in Seattle who was ashamed of Trump's reaction to protests now claims to have a gun after Starbucks coffeehouse under his apartment was destroyed — RT USA News
Paul Gallant has had a new perspective on violent protests after mocking President Donald Trump of the United States in June for saying that the anarchists were burning and stealing Seattle City.
The only thing that needed to be heard was that the director’s home was closer.
"I feel like I have to buy gun because this will clearly continue to happen," Gallant said on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the Starbucks coffee shop on the lowest floor of his multi-storey house had been destroyed.
“It looks like a street party down the street from me. It’s very angry now.”
The situation was quite different when Trump complained last month about the city’s being allowed violent protesters to take over the city.
“These liberal Democrats are ruthless, ” said the president.
“The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they just think it’s wonderful, even death.”
Gallant, a co-controller of the “Danny & Gallant ” cooperative radio station in Seattle, replied: “Go through there for inquisitions last night and see no burning, robbery, or death.
Gallant said last night that the police advised the residents to stay away from his apartment building, where explosives might be found in the damaged Starbucks coffeehouse.
He published pictures of the damage and said, “Well done, idiots, ” saying that he had also seen fire a few blocks away.
"I don't know what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The twist did not go past people who mocked Gallant for his earlier opinion and chirped messages such as "Just relax," and "Yah, maybe Trump was right."
Jason Rantz, a second broadcaster in Seattle, said, “We’re not finally going on this tour of ours. ”
Gallant laughed: “Awake and saw that a lot of people were hurling at me “sleep down on the salmon. ”
He said he stood by his previous statement as he had walked through the Chaz-autonomous region of anarchist and though it was not as bad as it would have been ruled out.
He said, "So it was burned and robbed after all."
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, looking for a living with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the scene of the White Lines, which deals with the sighs and falls of Ibiza, but in the search of homes over the past week, their taste was another and calmer, away from the pleasure of the party island.
The couple, who play siblings in the Netflix series popular, were seen looking at a magnificent farmstead in Oxfordshire, which is available for sale at 1.2 million pounds.
They came to the area in Range Rover, which was Laura, 34, drove, wearing bilestone pants and white shirts, and met a real estate store there, which led them on a tour of the five - room house.
In White Lines, which was recorded last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who explores the darker side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, who is played by Tom, 28 years old.
Their relationship was not established until earlier in this month, less than a year from the end of the six-year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin, who is known from the Hunger Games.
Together, the four - year - old son Pip has Margot, a two - year - old daughter.
When they reported on the divorce in August of last year, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I have decided to divorce the law; we understand in love, friendship, and with deep respect for each other, and will continue our cooperation in the training of our children.
Laura and Sam met first in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “an unquestionably the greatest achievement of my life. ”
Before Laura got her part in the White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweeners movie, and in the crime drama The Capture from BBC, which was shown last year, where she played lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweeners movie and in the series Brittania from Sky.
Counts too early to claim another wave here on land
A forensic expert at the National Medical Institute says too early to claim another wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic infections were detected in the National Hospital’s viral ward yesterday and are frequented by dozens of people.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, one in a male aged 30 and the other in a male aged 20.
No infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Last night, then, three more domestic infections were detected, one of which had been at the Rey Cup soccer tournament in Laugardal.
In a conversation with a news agency, John K. Johannsson, a government intelligence officer, said that this infection required fewer visits than initially thought.
Another infection is that of a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15th.
At that time, rules on so - called home admissions had been accepted.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a medical expert at the National Institute of Medicine, says that the subject, however, followed the old course.
His vision was negative when he came to the land, but he became ill when he was isolated, and six were infected.
They're all on their way to show, but two of them are starting to show symptoms.
The third infection is associated with the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and who has been infected with it.
It has been found that there is a new variant of the coronal virus that has not been detected in this country.
“We don’t know exactly where this virus type comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
Whoever is considered to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel but also in other European countries."
It believes too early to claim that the so - called other waves of the epidemic have begun here in Europe, just as other countries fear it.
“ While the majority is still operational, the table is not.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, thinking about ways to react if something like that could start."
Megan Fox Expresses About the Relationship
Megan Fox claims to have found his twin room in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that my twin room was talking about," says Fox, 34.
“ Two - letter souls are when the soul has reached a sufficiently high level to be able to divide into two different bodies at the same time, ” Fox explained.
“ So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him out in his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly agrees, but they were introduced to film.
“ I was just hanging outside her trailer and hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months have passed since Fox divorced his husband up to ten years of age, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
The American musician, the ticcogul, and the president - provoking Kanye West have apologized to Kim Kardashian West for a plea he made publicly in the family’s personal affairs.
“I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for discussing private matters publicly, ” he wrote on Twitter last night.
Their relationship has been in serious disrepute, but Kanye has recently gone a long way on social media, and at a mass meeting that he held last Monday, he discussed among other things the birth of his daughter North West and said that he had almost killed her.
Kim then stepped up on Wednesday and published a message to his followers on Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously spoken publicly about his husband’s illness, saying that this is due to the children of his wife and Kanye’s right to privacy when he comes to his health.

They are not the stars behind any kind of winemaking.
It seems popular to be in some business when they are not standing on the white tent or singing to millions of spectators.
Increased weight in protests against racial rights in the United States
Opposers have walked the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
Objections have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25th, when George Floyd killed a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal policemen to Portland, and thus has continued to support the protest.
The protesters now also object to the presence of federal policemen in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used bombs and tear gas, arresting 45 people, after protests to support the protests in Portland resolved into violence.
According to the police, over 20 police officers were injured.
One died Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was launched into the Black Lives Matter march.
Media reports that the man may have walked up to a car - armed rifle before being shot.
“The essence of the matter is that it’s terrible for someone to die in protest,” said Steve Adler, Mayor Austin, in a statement.
Adler said that he was “tortured and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first shot at the police, thinking they were burglars.
One policeman has been fired because of Taylor's death, but the other officers have not been brought to trial.
The leadership of the NFAC group, armed by a group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation into Taylor's murder.
According to police information, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when an accident occurred in the rebel army.
Possible group infection at the time of loading
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside of border shadow.
Two of them were diagnosed with previously unseen virus variants and appear to produce three out of five infections to be totally unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a return - of - the - country tourist or by a nonsympathetic Icelandic, who have probably infected more people.
A local pathologist says that a possible group infection may be associated with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with each type of virus.
The source of infection is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by another that was diagnosed on Thursday; the other one came to the country on July 15, and probably became infected out, but the third one is also infected with foggy origins.
After a serial analysis in Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two individuals who were diagnosed with the virus and associated with it have a new variant that has not been identified in the country before.
Kamilla Joseph’s daughter, a National Health Care Expert and a local health - care professional, says that the most likely source of this virus is an Icelandic genetic analysis.
“ Another case was similar to the virus that has been used in Switzerland but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it more closely, and they're going to find out what part of the world the contagion comes from," she says.
"However, it seems to be here on this side of the Atlantic."
Thus, the infection is unrelated to the two that arrived at the beginning of July and were directed to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has arrived outside rather than from within?
“Yes, it’s different from what has been found here before that there is really no chance that this has been something to grind here,” Kamilla answers.
“All sorts of odds are that these individuals have somehow got in touch with a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing for themselves.”
She says that at present there is no indication of where this new virus could have come to the country.
“ It could be a traveler who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not get the symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected, and then, naturally, more infections could follow.
We'll be on our toes the next few days to watch it."
“ The time has come for nothing that is a clever group infection.
But there are individuals who went on an epidemic in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have been exposed to them," continues Kamilla.
“ We haven’t got the results yet.
So that could possibly be a group infection at the time of sailing."
Do you assume that there is now a social detoxification?
“It’s not impossible.
It hasn't been recently, but it's not impossible because we don't know who has been carrying this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and on the other hand yesterday."
Could it be said that there is now a wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
However, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep that in mind, even if there are such limits to how much we can view people.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but first that we're getting infection that seems undetectable, we need to be given a little looser hands by taking samples out of people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, it can be expected that the National Hospital's antibiotic and virology division will give in to the demonstrations in the next few days to try to map the situation in this country more closely.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase the domestic viewing capacity and to provide for screening at the border?
“ Not at all, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for a sample to be taken in individuals who are not in the screening dossiers; the individual must be in a state of sickness and show symptoms or symptoms or have had symptoms and suspicions of contacting someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It notes that infection was still being diagnosed yesterday and that there is now much work to be done to obtain information about the individual’s journeys.
It says that the origin of domestic infections seems undetectable, but it does not rule out that some of those who have now been infected can provide clues that eventually lead the contagion team to the original infections.
The feasting place that most people know about but one of the best
There are not all those who have a clean location in the restaurant Bjargarsteinn and, of course, there are more fans abroad than here in the country if you can make the statement about him on TripAdvisor and other pages.
It has been heard by people who have flown in to the land to visit him with no wonder.
Mountainside Rijðarsdóttir, food blogger and cookbook writer, came to Bjargarstein on the days and kept water of fondness
“ I don’t know where to start because the restaurant Björgarstein on the Foundation is simply a wonderful place to say.
The house's history is one of the most beautiful things I know, the food up to ten, don't look at the worse end and wonderfully entertained servants!" says Berglind.
“ The Gower, the owner of Bjargstein, enchanted each animal’s right before us.
My wife and I were sitting with our girls for an entire evening, so that must tell us how good the food was," Berglind added.
“ The house where the restaurant is housed is an old apartment house, which was moved to the whole area of Grundarförður.
The present owners ran into this house for sale on Akranes, found a beautiful seafront, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the house's history on the Bjargarstein's home page."
“ The houses and all the borders of the Bjargarstein are unique.
It has been a gathering of differences from the entire family, and it certainly has its taste in the home.
On the upper floor there is a sitting room and a real choice and home to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and the cooking then are not hidden, and it is evident that much effort is being made to enchant the tasteful and beautiful restaurants," says Berglind, who is a sign that the pictures are not a lie.

Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: "His music will live"
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, a member of Fleetwood Mac, who died today at 73 years of age.
Green was a founder of this historic rock band, along with formerly named Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green left the band in 1970, before reaching her peak with records such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that “his music will live on. ”
"For me and all the former and present member of Fleetwood Mac is losing Peter Green a great memory moment," said Fleetwood in conversation with PA.
“ Peter was the man who founded the Fleetwood Mac band with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined the Fleetwood Mac without having deep respect for Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be transported by unwavering passion."
"Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live," added the 73-year-old rock star.
“ I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer for all those years.
We did a good job, and we did a proper course of music that so many have enjoyed.
“ God be with you, my dear friend... with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood. ”
Green’s death was confirmed in the statement by Swan Turton: “The family of Peter’s Green reported with great sorrow that Peter died this weekend, peacefully asleep.
A further statement will be published in the next days."
Green leaves behind his daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, whom he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, but the band was originally named "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac Featuring Jeremy Spencer".
However, the singer left the band in 1970, after four records.
Fleetwood Mac was going to receive a lot of praise and popularity around the world after more were added to the group, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on Rumours and Tusk’s records.
Prince Jehoakim’s feeling continued
Joakim Danaprin, the younger son of Margaret Thorough Queen and Henry’s late Danaprin, is still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he went into surgery last day because of blood clots in the brain.
According to the speaker of the Danish court, the Danish government radio, DR, has said that it is uncertain how long the prince, who is 51 years old, will be in the hospital, but his feelings are stable.
According to a report from DR, the effect of blood clots on the health of the prince is now being investigated.
This is indicated by the doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with health issues for DR, that the consequences of blood clots in the brain often do not occur until days after surgery.
“It can be anything from negligible symptoms to paralysis, memory problems or difficulties in expression, ” says Geisling.
He says the prince could wait for many months for rehabilitation.
Joakim Danaprins, whose full name is Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and is also a Count of Monpezat, stayed on the family vineyard, Château de Cayx in southern France when he got sick on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in Cahor’s town, which is a short distance from the ranch, but then moved to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent a blood clot operation in his brain.
Google Pixel 4 can generate the galaxy
Double optical zooming allows the lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in a three-dimensional way, thus providing a better contrast in the background with a face-up setting than in the previous pixel-space, trusting the alpha of software to achieve these so-called "boeh" effects.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google’s mythical photographer Annie Leibovitz set out to discuss his experience with pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
Engineering is still in the forefront of all aspects of Google’s new smartphones, and in this phone, “computerized imaging” is new to improve HDR+ settings by combining up to nine different images.
New dual display controls offer different lighting and shadow modes and allow users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on computer studies to provide better automatic whitening and to improve night vision, which is so sensitive that it can capture the galaxy in the night sky.
In addition to other camera software, the Pixel 4 Soli "racing squamble" features a front-end phone that detects Motion Sense motion so that users can skip the song, turn off the timing, turn the alarm or turn the phone off by waving their hand.
All calculations of Motion Sense are performed on the device rather than connected to the Internet and the same applies to enhanced Google devices, where the technician is now stressing to shorten the response time and improve the privacy of users.
Further emphasis on Google’s full use of its machine learning capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that converts on-line audio without sending data to the Internet.
The app is currently only available in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadium, a cloud-based playground to be launched on November 19th in the United States, but still after the Australian date.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds hearing aids.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smartphone, which is expected next year, is completely wireless and has sound adjustments that listen to the environment and constantly adjust the sound accordingly to make the most of the information.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smartphones are completely wireless and set the volume to match the noise around you.
Google also announced an update of its connected Wi-Fi home in the Nest WiFi line with a special bone, along with many basic sites working together to improve wireless connections within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor’s memory and adds built-in audio and speaker to use the Google Guide at each base of the home.
It is sold in Australia on November 5, and costs 399 estrals for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double the bass and has received built-in wall fixation.
All Google smart speakers will have a new call system feature for communication between devices in the home as well as a capability to call Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.
CLUE: The final day of Juventus' World Championships can seal the victory
Here is an overview of the football in Europe on Sunday:
This is the last day of the season, and there is still a lot to be done: a right to participate in the Masters and the European Union, the last two bottom seats and the Gold Choir prize.
Manchester United, Chelsea, and Leicester are fighting for the last two seats in the championship after Liverpool and Manchester City champions.
One level separates the past three, and Leicester receives the United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenam are fighting to secure a seat in the European Union.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth want to avoid the two remaining base seats at the side of Norwich, which is already dead.
When one game is left, Jamie Vardy from Leicester is the goaliest player with 23 points, two more than Danny Ings from Southampton and three more than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Arsenal.
The review of getting into the final league begins with Swansea receiving Brentford in their first predisposition game.
Fulham plays with Cardiff in the other front colours that start on Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich already got out of the next division.
Juventus can make his own assessment by reaching the ninth chapter of Series A, with victory over Sampdoria.
Thus, Bianconeri would be ranked seven points after Inter Milan, which is second when two games are left.
On the other hand, Lecce needs to work in Bologna in order to have a further hope of staying away from falling down into a division.
Lecce is four points behind Genoa, which is in 17th place and is one game ahead.
A pole-fisher “sleep to throw a bottle of beer into a sale” in Devon
A pole hunter threw a bottle of beer into a cell when he interrupted the fishing line, according to a charity gathering.
Images taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show a man on a rock that throws object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the gray seller had been fishing when the pole hunter emptied out of the bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called this “abominable and careless behavior. ”
He said he was picking up garbage at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning with other people in the seal - protection company Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
“ The soul tried to get on the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The pole hunter stretched the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it into the seller.
"The bottle landed behind the seller and he swam away."
Knowledge said that “whoever goes better was selling a strong - built animal ” than that the seller had simply been doing what was natural to him.
“By throwing a glass bottle into him, you’re stopping him from fishing, ” he said.
The Seal Project Company said that this was “not an isolated incident” and that it had recently received “many reports of this aggressive behaviour”.
According to the Facebook team, it has collected 12 bags of garbage from its volunteers at the Hope's Nose collection on Sunday and “many examples of antisocial behavior” have been observed.
All sales are protected by the laws governing the protection of seals, and people are asked to stay away from them.
A giant from the Christian Poll in Laxa, Denmark
The first hundred were caught in Laxá in the valleys of the second part of today.
There was the work of Arnor Isförð Gudmundsson.
He had been in a state of horror in the Christian poll this morning, and it was six inches [89 cm].
After noon, he was again at the hands of a Christian student, thinking of a story he had heard about the slowness of the car after the horror.
With this in mind, he went with Collie Dog and threw himself over a Christian pill.
Soon he got a take, and as he tells himself.
“ After about five seconds, he cleaned himself completely, and I realized that it was the meter.
I got stressed out because I had 11 pounds of tea.
Usually I'm stuck with fish, but I had this one for forty minutes.
In fact, he was quite comfortable.
Took a few trips up and down the pool, but then I got to strand him, and it was a great feeling.
Crawl from me on the pole and jump on it.
He measured ten inches [102 cm], and I disputed him," said a bold hunter in the Cattleman's Cattlehouse in Laxá, Daalum, in conversation with Spordals.
Arnor is like no one starting when it comes to a hundred calls.
That was his eighth.
He received such fish in Mixing, Black Sea, Rosary, Kjarrá, two in Langadalsá, and one in East Ranga.
According to Arnor, there is a fine fishing in Laxá, Daalum.
The cave that will finish at noon tomorrow comes with 35 salmon, and our man has eighteen of them.
Expect a great flood because of Hannah.
Hanna, the first hurricane of the Atlantic this year, reached a country in Texas, U.S.A., last night.
Hannah quickly lost power and became a storm, yet much rain has taken place in the area and is expected to receive extensive floods.
Thus, up to one day, up to two inches [30 cm] of rain is expected, but in special places, it could reach as much as two inches [46 cm], according to the AP newsmagazine.
In particular, warnings are given about dangerous rapids that could occur as a result of rain.
The area where Hannah reached the country has been affected by the large distribution of the new coronary virus there.
In addition, she has gone ashore and caused damage.
Now there are at least 43,700 people without electricity, and there have been multiple assistance stations in the area.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, said hesitantly about the hurricane in the night and said it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below you can see the footage captured by the AP Newspaper filmmaker this morning.
House burned, stores plundered and intruded damage
Over sixty more are dead and sixty more wounded after attack in the village of Masteri in Darfur district of Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in the series of serious security incidents last weeks in which houses were burned, shops and markets robbed and infested, ” says a United Nations Office on Human Rights in the capital of Cartum, which was launched today.
Mr. Abdalla Hamdok, prime minister of Sudan, has published the fact that security forces will be sent to the region’s war zone to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days have passed since an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
"The accumulation of violence in the Darfur region is leading to an increase in upheaval, endangering agriculture and threatening people's lives and livelihood," says the United Nations.
The conflicts in Darfur, western Sudan, began in 2003 when most Arab rebels rose against the government of Kartum.
The forces of government and Arab soldiers who tried to silence the rebellion have been accused of widespread brutality, but some 300,000 were killed in the fighting, according to the United Nations estimate.
Omas al-Bashir, who was overthrown by a chair as leader of Sudan, is nominated by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocides and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
A television reporter thanks an audience for noticing cancerousness
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A Florida TV reporter thanks a attentive audience for observing her neck and e - mailing her that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, a WFLA newsman in Tampa, took this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she was going to surgery on Monday to remove the tumour, thyroid, and some lymph nodes.
“The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we are hoping that this will be my first and last operation,” she said.
The audience e - mailed Price for the last month, saying that the nod reminded her of the nod she had.
Price, a 28 - year - old researcher, said during the week that her screenplay was “8 with you. ”
“ But the role was recently exchanged when the audience joined ME and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.
“ I will be forever grateful to the woman who started sending me an e - mail, a totally unknown woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did so nevertheless.
Talking about being with a man in a team."
Part of the Jeronimo Open Space outpost temporarily closed after two barrages — CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by the plain wolves near the Oso Creek footpath on Jeronimo Road at Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and closed the way temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a coyote almost every morning and usually she tries to avoid them, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bit her foot.
The route has been closed during the investigation.
Mission Viejo stated: “Today, two different players announced that a smooth wolf had bitten a human being. Animal welfare services Mission Viejo is working in collaboration with the department of fish and animal life, and part of the Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. Be careful and watchful when you’re traveling where there is a lot of wild animals.”

The protesters of racial hatred are in contact with the Seattle police.
Battles in Seattle on Sunday between police and Protestants against racial hatred ended with the arrest of a large number of people, but discontent among the public because of the United States president Donald Trump’s plan to send a large number of federal policemen into major cities.
In May, protests against racial hatred and police violence have occurred following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis.
On Saturday’s protests, protesters in Seattle cut wheelcars and broke windows in trailer homes, causing police to declare riots and to empty the streets with pepper sprays and flares.
The protesters also set sail on a construction site for a future juvenile detention centre.
The police said that 45 people had been arrested, but 21 policemen had been injured.
The protests were conducted in support of the protests carried out in the neighboring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump ordered the very controversial radical actions of the federal police, in the unscrupulous local authorities, who say the police use excessive force.
Conventional tours have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in downtown on Saturday night, according to the police.
At the same time, Trump’s high protests are increasingly difficult to re-elect in November, and have developed a tough police policy.
