Fire extinguished in French chemical work
The big fire at a chemical plant that is particularly dangerous in the north of France's city of Rouen has been destroyed. Normandy's prefecture announced on Friday. The fire had broken out on Thursday at night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was used with about 200 fire-fighting vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainer was called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of Seveso are manufactured additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the Lubrizol company of US-Millardär Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
About 400 people are working in the factory. The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak drained the gas methanethiol and the environment far-reachingly smoked for lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to seek 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and gave up her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the bitch every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was upset," said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stop at the hotel somewhere else, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four or four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King in front of "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. However, weeks were spent. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears were spilling"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: a man reported himself and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King said, "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her."
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday 27 September, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the remains are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "frighting" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them so far without trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 bullet ammunition. This is reflected in a list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which reports the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 shot ammunition have been re-appeared. The remaining weapons and parts of weapons include six MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six P8 pistols and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of the loss of arms and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "disquieting," said the Left Federal Council member Martina Renner. This was all the more valid since, in the course of investigations, hardly anything had been recovered. The Left politician spoke of a "difficult balance." Renner criticised that the list was not recognizable as to whether under the lost ammunition the ones found in the investigations against the under-terrorist Federal Armed Forces Franco A. had been found. "And even though a Franco A. supporter had recently been convicted of possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially he continued in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that one wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been imposed on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Hormuz's Sea Street under the pretext of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to the UK.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is being shipped through the oceans. The tensions in the region had intensified immensely over the past months. The trade shipping has been involved in the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of the people during the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has honoured the commitment of the people in the GDR who went on the road 30 years ago during the Peace Revolution. In the autumn of 1989 courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the coming day of German unity in Erfurt. The chancellor reminded among other things of the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken away from the horror," she said.
Musk strives for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may be keeping record. Despite the delivery boom, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York. Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given its electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus achieved its previous best.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400,000 cars. In the current and coming quarter of the year six-digit numbers have to be produced. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the booms there were last losses.
Riddle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from ticking themselves. This was found by scientists from Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fierce about the kitzels, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the arrival of a tickling hand alone causes laughter before touching. This lies on a deep layer in the big brain, which already causes laughter when the kitzel is expected.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasonic field when they are tickled by humans. This "laughing" is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self - touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between contact and contact by others - so people cannot tickle themselves. However, in the experiments in rats, the Berlin researchers found that laughter as well as the activity of the area of the cerebral cortex in question is suppressed during a self-movement. This is also the case if living beings wash themselves. During the foreign contact and the tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and impulse has been increased to laugh.
But pass the self touch and touch by others at the same time, be the laughing suppressed as well. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that humans cannot tick themselves because the self touch activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment they sometimes broke off this initiation, showing escape behavior or scars. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Large fire in French chemical work erased
The big fire in a chemical plant that is considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been wiped out. This was the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out on Thursday at night.
According to the authorities, no substances that are harmful to health should have expired. The samples taken give no cause for alarm, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was used with about 200 fire vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

In the chemical plant on the banks of Seveso, additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US-Milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso directive, which imposes particularly stringent safety requirements.
The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when 2013 by leaking the gas methanethiol escaped and the environment far-reachingly smoked after rotting eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first sitting in Parliament after the break-up on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without agreements, but Brussels should not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement.
About Cox, who had been working for Britain's stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to restore this country to one another would be to withdraw from the EU." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Remembering the attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead people on Saturday in Norway a memorial is revealed in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron copies of roses. They recall the roses that had been placed by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. The opening is expected, among other things, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired an autobomb in Oslo's government district and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organisation of the Social Democratic Workers Party. Overall, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in Iran could get back to sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has been detained in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk shipping company announced.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now travels to Dubai, among other things, for medical investigations, explained Erik Hånell. Towards noon the ship had left Iranian waters. "Nice that it is over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The London Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the determination of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had ordered the tanker to have failed to comply with the provisions of the law of the Persian Gulf on 19 July. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well accordingly, Hånell said. They had been professional in the face of the difficult and pressing situation over the past ten weeks. The shipowners now work on bringing them back to their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain at the beginning of July. According to the delivery, the authorities rejected EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The reference to the ship had been received by the British from the USA.
Iran spoke of "Piratry" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspects, it was a trade in exchange for the "Stena Impero" to be released, as London felt.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world’s oil exports are being shipped through the oceans. The tensions in the region had become immensely exacerbated in recent months. Trade shipping has been involved in the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
The Iranian leadership is proposing to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States alone had stepped out of the international nuclear agreement, which should prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting pressure on the country with massive economic sanctions to force a more stringent agreement on other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented at the UN General Assembly in New York a plan for security and peace in the streets of Hormus. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, along with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign security forces, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would be predestined to be a "war-winner". Faced with the criminal tariffs imposed on US President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-disperse. Financial leaders of Asian companies who are considering shifting their production from China to another country, call India in a UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives. This obviously has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers as well as a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more important role to play in the global long-term production chain.
But now India itself has become the focus of Trump’s focus. Devalued from Haudeen in the White House as “Kingdom of Customs”, America has deprived the emerging markets of 2000 products at the beginning of June. The USA blames India prohibitively for high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictions with India certainly represent only a sideshow. In addition, America also views the world’s largest democracy through the Security Policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concerns about China’s claims of power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a ointment of American criminal charges against India is unlikely to occur. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken a second five-year term, should therefore weigh in safety.
However, the problem lies in another location: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. His reformer is primarily aimed at the bureaucratic madness that suffocated in the multi-ethnic state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies are now receiving rapid building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more restrictive insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for the more rapid liquidation of high-debt companies.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics, much has improved in India in the first five months of fashion. However, this does not apply in trade policy. It is the result of which the national conservative government even created new barriers to protecting companies that are not competitive internationally from foreign suppliers.
In the West, the Nimbus of the energetic reformer is based on a radical economic renewal of his country. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never resorted to a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to eliminate anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the rejection of their industries are among the main voters of Modis Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and cling to this short-sighted policy.
Resettlement of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
The former French President, Jacques Chirac, is expected to be buried in Paris on Monday at Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP, calling for the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. A public funeral in Paris's Invalidity was scheduled for Sunday, as media reported.
Carrying the competitors to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Athletics World Cup
The world's tip was long in the finish when the below-cooled Khalifa International Stadium was playing heartwarming scenes. Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously in the first run of the men over 5,000 metres. He could hardly hold on to his feet well 300 meters before the finish, ran in unhealthy, curving posture, as Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country suddenly hurled him under and dragged him back to the finish with the last half of the stadium round. The forces reached both but still to stop the coming wristwatch after the finish. As if the scene had not been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. He didn't want to talk at all about his heroic act. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a loved one. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup. Under normal circumstances he couldn't even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
In the evening, he did so emphatically - and much more intensely than he would have imagined. For this heroic act will be remembered. Zumal Dabo even made his competitor busby his goal and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this process. In the end, it had nothing to do with it, because the busby that came into the goal was disqualified precisely because of that end by the World Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, came to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, though at 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already." However, only in training, that doesn't count best times.
Millions of Machines: Egyptians Arm themselves for Wild Protest Day
Security measures have been strengthened in Egypt in advance of possible government-critical protests. On Friday in the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already last day, the police had reinforced their street controls and the phones of pedestrians had partially searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been hundreds of protests against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian entrepreneur and actor Mohammed Ali, who played the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" in central places in the country for this Friday. Ali demands a "Volksrevolution" for most young Egyptians, but he is not a "good man, because he was a sub-subcontractor for the army, but his messages arrived.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed at first. The government also confirmed and did not comment on the figures.
Possible arrests
Many people had been "willfully arrested" because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place," HRW announced under appeal to lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the prisoners range from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, the security forces questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW statements also arbitrarily passersby.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government blocks websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sissi.
Online retailers: Shippers should be able to return more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Some 20 million returns land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way of donating returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from the sales tax on material donations, the Ministry explained to a question of the Green Bundestag faction about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that when ordering on the Internet, the Germans would return every 6th package. About four percent of the goods - some 20 million products - were then landed in the garbage. They would pay the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities would consider donations of material such as a turnover that would then be subject to sales tax.
The Green faction chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies can donate non-commercial products accordingly and free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online commerce, but also to other shops from fashion stores to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work by Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys's work underlines "the re-formation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic posture of animals and tribes". On Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it will be auctioned on October 3rd. It will be estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist once again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Finally, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard-hit exchange with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons after the lifting of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson, if necessary, wants to carry out the Brexit which had already been postponed twice on 31 October without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, intervenes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks with a chisel a star of the European flag. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not, in his opinion, contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy was a "walking in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book show. "We will enjoy this. We will leave the EU and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past few days and had accused them of "treasoning" the people, among other things. Claims that he could put the MEPs at risk because they could become targets of threats of murder, he resigned as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to rest would be if MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU. It would not be surprising that people were concerned that the United Kingdom had not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," it was said in a statement. "And we should listen too".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war was likely between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India, Khan said on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If this was going bad, one hoped for the best, but were prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, one of which is part of China. At the beginning of August, India had removed the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan dramatically.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts harshly. It fires the population with sharp ammo, more than 2000 prisoners are gathered in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison there. Protesting in Egypt has never been dangerous. However, since the seizure of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus does everything to avoid a scenario such as at times of Arab spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, loss of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get in control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third party lives in Egypt below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he is financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, also the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It is always critical when large parts of the population have difficulty in producing a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "Showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months has been examined to see if the complicated system interlocking at BER fire protection works. The operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale testing of Tüv in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening next October. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still deficiencies in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule until the start-up still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is no longer too large. The construction announcement is due to be filed with the Building Office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be addressed, and the Tüv intends to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for taking up flight operations, the Tüv needs to continue to work intensively to deal with the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects this to be available until the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the interchange to the station below the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking shortening, which comes down at a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be exchanged. Then there should be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The opening of the airport for years is slowed down by problems with fire protection and other beams as well as planning errors. Originally, it was planned to start operating in 2011. Since the start of 2006, costs have increased from two billion to probably about 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the managers are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, it is to be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the Chairman Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial manager Heike Fölster is changing to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She set the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Drugs vending machines - Police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and chased several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area into the air! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
Over the past two years, the number of broken cigarette and ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police caught a German, 33-year-old, on the Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations for the production of explosives explosions in crime unit with particularly severe cases of theft, which were conducted by the Chemnitz criminal police, this suspicion against the 33-year-olds not only confirmed itself."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now had a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the booty he apparently financed his anesthetic dependence." The bomber only blew up four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019 parking ticket machines on the citizens' street.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The automaton bomber is now under investigation. Police investigations against him continue.
I think he was also responsible for other automatic leaps in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reversing its strategy for Vienna Airport. Amidst the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa’s daughter AUA is taking over “the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna”, a press speaker from Austrian Airlines confirmed on Friday to the APA. Previously, “AviationNetOnline” had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Cheap Flyer Eurowings will be de facto dissolved. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. Starting in January 2020, AUA will take over in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings-Personal. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings-Basis in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA-Drehkreuz and the network planning, said the speaker. The flight times should be coordinated on connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen Vienna's hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralised transport from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as "Production Company" for the group's sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product was to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants were to come from Eurowings. Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number will no longer be completed in Terminal 1, but in the same way as AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport, a price struggle broke out after the Niki leadership. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that the Viennese fleet would increase to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost pilot will send four Ryanair machines, including crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", criticizing the trade union as a structure for circumvention to the collective agreement.
In five years' time, the Battle of Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary, who will have overtaken the AUA in Lauda, was released on Friday's AUA board Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the Cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was supposed to have stopped by his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," said the couple, who have been together since October 2018, in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us in the coming years with love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne sequence and the real estate mogul will be a celebration as great as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarct? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetics of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the genetics of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to learn more detail about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the foundation, and the Zurich University Hospital, are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the entire genetics of 8,000 healthy people with the 1,000 former patients of the University of the heart and vascular center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were known, said the clinic.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and myocardial infarction. The data could also be useful in investigating other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University of the Heart and Vascular Center. New insights on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer diseases are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the firm intention to use the data for the investigation of other diseases. The Department of the Foundation in Davos has been dealing with allergies so far. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics was created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburg, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. With the encryption of genetics, the scientists strictly considered the protection of the anonymized data. It is a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from Zurich University Hospital.
Today, according to the UKE, a human genetic heritage can be deciphered within 24 hours. The total cost of the gene was EUR 1300. The first gene sequence worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on October 1st, and all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020. The first results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police freed hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to information from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still underage, as police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them indicated that they had been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and "improved". Indeed, the guardians had been held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small space.
The Koran School was reported to have been around ten years. Residents had made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran School, Sabo said. They had not known about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the majority of northern Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to UN refugee aid, therefore, over the past ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police freed 400 children from school
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria freed nearly 400 students from horrific circumstances. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries pointing to torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a note in an Islamic school. The conditions there had been "unworthy of man". The officials arrested the principal and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held at their school as slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed mutilated and injured students in a recognisable poor state of health.
World football selection: More accusations after Messis and Klopps Kuer
Football "Signature Not Valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. It is the sixth honor and thus record for Lionel Messi.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations come from other countries to the fifa. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
In recent years, much of the Fifa has proved to be advocating: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Cup election has not yet been suspected of running out unclean - if one is to avoid the fact that the qualified national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often agree to sympathy rather than to an objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now apparent: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible poll.
The Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms had been given in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without a reply.
Sudan's Trainer Also Surprised
There is also an appeal from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Federation states that trainers Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk in place two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, the vote was also received in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Federation.
The allegations of Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also been raised: "Do not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details about my vote are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his name.
On Friday the Federation came to report: True, but of course it was not intended. The filled-in electoral documents had been "unbelievably" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, said it in a communication from the Federation. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", it was said in the communication. However, Rosas as well as the team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases allow the fifa to be examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So long, Lionel Messi will remain the undisputed winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine-Affair: Ranghohe Republicans Proclaim for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly expressed themselves for an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here, the facts are determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. They had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott reportedly observed Trump Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far been holding back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, few have shown discomfort because of this. Scott’s comments are now a first sign of Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had turned against Trump’s policy several times, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening up of immigration legislation.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. federal states, have not formally participated in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. With Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disrupting". US media also reported that among the Republicans there were internal first cracks.
The affair could lead to the launch of an arrest procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, and they suggest abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the recruitment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could work on a so-called impeachment. The decision on the actual appointment was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for such a procedure are therefore small. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily; they are supposed to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unauthorisedly managed the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new serious accusations against rockets can be loud. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sizilia) after migrants have recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we have no known information at all," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Muhammad C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and atrociously subjected - by repeated and constant physical violence", it was said in the communication at that time.
NGOs and relief organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes onto the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people of Libya are fleeing. It is therefore quite likely that criminals are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed".
Italian Justice Minister Matteo Salvini immediately apologized to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives for a delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given strong boost to his electric car group with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous best.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 36,000 to 400,000 cars. In the current and coming quarter of the year six-digit numbers are required. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the booms there were last losses.
U.S. Budget dispute: Renew only bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the United States Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the upper spending limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again facing the new fiscal year starting on 1 October without spending plans. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing (continuing resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shut-down on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown used
The Federal Government is now being financed temporarily at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in good time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Government cannot benefit for the first time from the spending framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also prepared ten of the twelve spending plans more or less, which are hardly plentiful.
The spirits differ primarily on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border control. In the Senate the Republicans apparently try to force $12 billion for the masonry, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disturbed by the plans for wall construction and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the masonry had escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the masonry, the spirits separate themselves
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than a consensus on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21st is not excluded.
Against the background of the ongoing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the consequent danger of a shut-down gain ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid shut-downs would automatically carry on financing the federal administration at the previous year's level, stop the travel activity of parliamentarians and keep their wages down until the new annual spending plans are presented.
France permits artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is also intended to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which should increase significantly the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The presentation still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which the health minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It pictures the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment which would allow widows to gain access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, artificial fertilization was allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there were cases in the past in which women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the advances in Paris argued that such a child had a "very serious fate".
On the other hand, numerous members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had expressed themselves in favour of artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would impose a "double grief" if her husband's death left her child's desire unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair for a widow to be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who can not witness children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the sobriety continues to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for Unis air tax will be louder
There is a lot to fly to the universities, so in future the country will also have a climate tax charged. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate about climate tax on flights from universities and universities before the summer break is about to start again. After the conference of regional rectors has responded skeptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university argue for compensation of service flights. This is the first step that is "necessary", while there must be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, says in their opinion. The Cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is still on ice, because the CDU has not yet approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia reinvents North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the prisoners were illegally caught in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injureds, it was called.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. So North Korean fishermen were on their way in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s Coast Guards are driving according to their own data to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the re-inspections, 30,000 squid had been discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing boats and two motor boats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans even after complaints by local entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested for this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also complained recently of high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrowly-mashed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In the future, only 18,000: USA lowers the upper limit of asylum
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shot down against those seeking protection: as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms in Washington, the ceiling for the legal admission of refugees is further lowered. In the future, most of the most threatened believers and Iraqis are to receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 economic year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left to the country, as the US Department of Foreign Affairs stated. In the almost completed economic year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception readiness for protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher admission limits had been imposed.
The indicated ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the launch of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs nevertheless called the U.S. as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formula that strongly resembles the use of language by the US President-in-Office.
A "responsible handling" of refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries in order to help rebuild them, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current action and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyy affair and a potentially threatening recruitment process.
In the future, the US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two groups of refugees, people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus at risk, as stated in the Foreign Ministry's Declaration. However, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The US wants to achieve that especially people from this "northern triangle" of Central America are applying for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements to curb immigration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang-Utan-Weibchen has been transferred to a reception station for human monkeys in the United States on request of Argentine justice from the former Buenos Aires Zoo. Born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986, "Sandra" was granted the rights of an "non-human person", so she was forced to leave. The animal was taken by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening, but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kg of heavy human affinities are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she will live in the open air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orang utans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" still has to survive a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of "Sandras" fundamental rights by animal protectors has contributed to the conversion of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023 a research and education site is to be established there to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climber: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husar ride at the almost 3,000-metre high Great Tin in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double ground or other means, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for ascent. Thus, he interrupted the old best brand in almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports product manufacturer Nike has made a significant profit gain. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (almost 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor applies directly to its customers online.
In the three-month period up to the end of August, sales increased to USD 10.7 billion. Nike sales increased most strongly with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Group from Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to direct sales to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Finance manager Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer with strategic investments to expand its competitive advantage. Investors were happy to respond to the quarterly figures – the sports product manufacturer's shares increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil was accused of Instagram by the fan. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@ofificialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who plays at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted on late Thursday. He reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma followers should never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly, Italian fans are scouring racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist songs at the First League party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on last Sunday.
But there had also been last discussions about the followers of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now demonstrated 38 ringing fans of record champion Juventus Turin with bans on stadiums. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police announced. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fangroups in the Juventus area. Among other things, the twelve are accused of heavy extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had put the investigations into place last year with an advertisement.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled military" the ticket trade for the fan basket and should have blackmailed Juventus employees to get to cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - all the years are thought of with catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the individual sense of life of young people?
"The Crabs Come!" This call officially launched the Crab Catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, with the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". Gaochun's great natural surroundings offer its residents all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun have already started to use crab breeding. Over the years, the crab industry has developed into a powerful industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important component of the economic development of Gaochun. Over the past few years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding and technology-based crab breeding. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform for "the distribution of power, the optimization of administration and public services" and has carefully established the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for prosecution, a network for services, a platform for lending", thereby optimising the city's environment for authorisation, for services and for development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a support sign for intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health sectors, as well as organic farms leading the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has supported the development of a national tourism area, all areas of national importance and tourist destinations, involving the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun countryside, the state of the buildings for civic services and the public service, the development of "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran-US conflict: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
After returning from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of a alleged offer from the United States to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with Tehran leadership, the United States had put an end to all sanctions, explained Ruhani on his official website.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation in this way: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says, I lift the sanctions," added Ruhani. The kind of punishment that should be ended has stood for debate. "And they have clearly said that we lift all sanctions".
However, if this advance had not been made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to rescue the nuclear agreement negotiated with Iran with Russia and China. This was intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel at the margins of the UN General Assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - nearly 200 earthquakes
After Western Turkey was shaken within the shortest period of time by two earthquakes, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake on the day before, there have been almost 200 earthquakes, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay on Friday. Thus, the concern for a disaster is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. The strength earthquake 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored again and again. Every year poorly built houses - among other things, swamp made by the many smaller earthquakes that shake Istanbul regularly.
Town planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned for years that large open spaces registered in the centre as refuge sites have long been built. Only by the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük obsessive in August had the architectural engineering chamber of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres of depth, as reported by the disaster prevention authority Afad. A smaller aftertaste caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, told Twitter that victims or injuries had not been reported at first. The state station TRT showed people who ran out of the houses in panic. Students were taken from the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students wept as they could see pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake near Istanbul in 1999. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7,1 to 7,4 might threaten strength. However, when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, the West of the country and Istanbul met again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with all the necessities standing next to doorsteps, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wafts. When the next big quake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to his report, two mosque minarettes crashed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic reported. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writing to a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned via Twitter. He called the people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to the official record, the time of the quake is 13.59 (local time). Just a few minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock, according to CNN Turkey, which was declared with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 the Turkish Marmara region shook - it was to Istanbul to feel. His epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the millions metropolis, the disaster protection authority told Afad already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy said to the transmitter. "Before or later, the great quake will also come."
Even a few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great anxiety in Istanbul. In Albania, there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured people. Also at Lake Constance this year the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine-Affaire
Two brilliant documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible assassination process, the U.S. democrats see themselves reinforced: The complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous informant and his controversial telephone office with the Ukrainian president raises important points for investigation against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: Air passenger locked by United Airlines in toilette - Flyer diverted
Since a passenger was detained in the Board toilet, a flight was diverted from United Airlines. The WC door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline announced according to US media.
With an extra-scheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the tight cabin. She had been detained for about an hour, the US media wrote under appeal to other passengers. To continue to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In an online video that is supposed to come from Flight 1554 according to the U.S. media, you can see how several people try to free the woman. "We're currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all the passengers. Open at first was whether the woman gets compensation.
The cockerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success writer Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. In it it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but is now at once the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is willing to let himself be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiters in high positions are just passing the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write." By McEwan only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines Like Me" about Artificial Intelligence.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is that of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and "sees himself transformed into an immense monster," is gradually excluded from family and society, and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that is the head," said Diogenes' publishing house.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary are equipped with fluid brakes to reduce noise pollution by freight trains. In addition, sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
This is to be made more comfortable according to EU regulations and to reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travel packages cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all the travels one day after his insolvency contract until and including 31 October 2019. Travel could not "be started for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
Also affected were bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or fully paid. As it stands to travel with start from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was called.
Thomas Cook in Germany had entered the UK parent group's plight and had filed insolvency proceedings on Wednesday. The company, which includes, among other things, Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer hotels immediately again
However, from this Friday hotels abroad, which are still hosting Thomas-Cook holidays, should receive money from the Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that vacationers are no longer charged for extra payments.
On the basis of booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman from the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas-Cook-Reisende from these hotels are not immediately requested or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel invoices," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance responded to reports by hotel guests who had been forced to pay their own accommodation on the premises according to their own information. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, the insurance spokesperson will vote with the insolvent travel provider on Friday. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauscal holidaymakers from Germany were on their way. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The now announced payouts to hotels through the Zurich insurance however only help the travellers who are currently on the move. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly in the holiday, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening the company announced that all travel by including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to those bookings that are already paid.
As it stands for travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined. Basically, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and use a web form to assert their claims.
Prince Harry destroyed Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the trail of his mother.
With a blue splitter vest, British Prince Harry in Angola set fire to a bomb mine and destroyed it.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he produced the ignition circuit in front of the TV cameras running on Friday morning. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the Savannah countryside without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict in the African country for decades, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey to Huambo, Harry wanted to walk directly on the trail of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same war master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path she was going on. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She also had support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African journey since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
As a matter of fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: there will be no guarantee of a third postponement of Brexit negotiations with him. But what statements have been made by the polarizing British people for an eternity of time. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a Damocles sword over the blond shovel. His suspension of Parliament to be able to run its Brexit course until the date of withdrawal was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of bilateral talks in the event of failure to negotiate with the EU by 31 October.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he indicated that in the event of non-conformity, he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I’m cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time has gradually run out of Brexit dealers in Brussels. About six weeks more, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks have not yet come to an end. An agreement by the end of October appears to be rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the date of withdrawal is in force. However, the opposition does not believe the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths caused by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, 805 confirmed and likely injured persons in this context, the US Health Agency announced CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 patients, some 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe so far no similar increase in lung damage is known. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times the videos were shared by Mohammed Ali in online networks. The construction contractor and actor living in Spain calls for a "People's Revolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, to which critics are anticipating corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass demonstrations with one million participants at central places in the country.
The security authorities are in any case alarmed. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Even in the past days, the police had reinforced their street controls and the phones of pedestrians partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On 20 September, the demonstrators gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been hundreds of protests with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protests in Egypt for years. The security forces responded accordingly. According to the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people were arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "at the wrong place" in the wrong time, HRW informed prisoners under appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he had overthrown the democratically elected Islamic president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival at the Port of Hamburg he was welcomed by, among other things, Skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had studied and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the polar researcher. He waited years for the young generation to speak up. For decades, it has been known that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. During the expedition it was, among other things, measured with a drone of Greenlandic glaciers and was fished with nets for microplastics.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the context of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are concerned with the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades".
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for pasta 430 Euro
430 Euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant close to the Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed to be two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 Euros was included paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"These cases harm Rome's reputation. We ask the police to consider whether this is a fraud," demanded a speaker from Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this cannot be taken from the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the host company said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, actually be confronted with an arrest procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal is the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States to the public with his complaint, is monstrous: The president has abused the power of his office to instrumentate the government of another country for an influence on the election of 2020. He has used Ukraine’s dependence to blackmail and so he wants to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to understand the text of the conversation with Selenskyj, which has been published in the meantime, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the phone call of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the center, alongside Trump, is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans are reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet Selensky in Kiev with the newly elected president, and the lawyer himself knows very precisely that his intentions are delicate. "We don't mix up with a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation of what we have the right to do," he says. He may think it's inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be pursued in Ukraine for which there's hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's counter-candidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had been conspiring with players in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the US. However, this accusation was never serious.
This is precisely about the investigation that Trump will speak so prominently on the telephone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: The former vice-president and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has forced Wiktor Schokin to resign as Ukraine’s commissioner of the Obama government. And, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company he is responsible for, in whose Supervisory Board his son Hunter Biden worked. Biden seniorly, Ukraine has been financially blackmailed to hide the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian public prosecutor leave, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also personally accused of deeply corrupt gestures, the US government was not the only Western partner in the long run who pushed for his resignation. Moreover, the Obama government explicitly supported investigations against the company.
Faults at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. Thus, Germany, the UK and Spain in particular are affected. On the website allusions.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also reports that content could not be loaded. Also, Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disorder, though not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disturbances
It’s not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services had been out for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also use Twitter to make their troubles air.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They were on a tugboat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hose boat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers were surely returned to their research station.
Attention: smartphone NOT wirelessly charging
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi-standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have just arrived on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - first and foremost the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to call a study from the beginning of July to memory. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely damaging to the devices. The reason for this is significantly greater heat development. If you load a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases. Furthermore, the watt strength of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for battery durability is a decisive factor. Every degree plays a role in this. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery does not only support capacity, but it does not last for so long. Thus, the life span is less. Researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since an battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has even increased the cost of battery exchange once again – and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a corresponding charging path - these are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salads and laborious plug-ins. As Qi ( stands for inductive energy transmission), a global standard is enforced, with which Apple has a special role, there are few limitations. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-stau-photograph: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world, according to his own data. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus has a record, his expedition organizer announced.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: A photo of mountain climbers, which is viral in the spring, that is on Mount Everest Snake.
The picture of the crossroads triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and highest peak of the earth. In May eleven climbers had died in the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the rise of the 14th eight-thousander: At present, the Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, among other things, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to speak to China in order to allow it to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead were also a pregnant elephant cow, a police officer announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited earlier fortress Sigiriya. The animals were reported to be police officers between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed every year by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants are still alive.
United Kingdom oil tankers leave Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its detention by Iran. This was announced by the news agency IRNA by the Bandar Abbas Maritime Office. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had imposed the tanks flying the flag of the British flag on 19 July under the pretext of having failed to comply with the provisions of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The responsible Economic Committee of the Lower House wants to investigate in detail the expenses of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It is the board's salary packages as well as the question of why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the company that is struggling to survive. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control of external auditors," said Rachel Reeves, Chairman of the Committee in London. "We obviously have to do it with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in intestinal cancer risk
The role of genes in familial increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg have come to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are therefore probably more difficult to assume. This has consequences for calculations of individual intestinal cancer risk, stress the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk makes Tesla shares rise
This is what Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla staff published by the industry blog "Electrek" on Thursday (local time). The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 40'000 cars. Six-digit numbers are needed in the current and coming quarter of the year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the booms, there were last losses.
Does the British government want to bypass Brexit law? Johnson withholding
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the law that was last passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a question he simply said to journalists on Friday that his government will uphold the applicable law.
The law provides that the government should apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "Capital Act" which complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would shift the entry into force of the law to the period after the EU's withdrawal.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran seems to drive up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inadequacy or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not stand to their promise, he put forward "further steps" away from the agreements of the 2015 difficult negotiated agreement.
Background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the commitment to Tehran, normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States, alone, stepped out of the agreement to force Iran, with "maximum pressure", to change its course in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump’s government intends to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now re-establishing tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran finally reacted to a resumption of uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or prepared the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September for use with uranium. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of imposing US sanctions, presumed Rohani. However, there will still be further discussions that hopefully broke a solution.
Rohani further contests Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, the concentration situation changed in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the U.S. assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huti rebels in Yemen supported by Iran were aware of the attack, but what was considered a false confession by the United States. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations have to prove it," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General debate had not been able to do so. Instead, they would have only called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past few days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump would first have to end the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration, Rohani demanded that the government in Washington turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from other star crossing the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This was achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn from other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crossed through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer on 2I/ Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-facing comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with a self-constructed telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Post-watches of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 that was sighted during a transit through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights into a strange solar system from the vicinity before it disappears on never again. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analysis, the comet is on the way on a so-called hyperbola path that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tails, which were first led under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, were named 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in the approach. Thus, the researchers remain for months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," said Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken the visitor to visit. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first investigation determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tails, which offer a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our, De León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such trippers are still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German for comet capture hunter). According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is either to wait for an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system, or to an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is time: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022 around 45 million passengers are scheduled to be delivered annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it will already be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s most recent prestige project is also called “Seesters” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new underground subway transports passengers to Beijing’s city centre in just 20 minutes.
Even during construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been built since 2006, has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine has landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of making it possible for this supersonic flight (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire for the 1930s, the U.S. broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said Agency Head Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As so far as the only passenger transport supersonic aircraft, the Concorde had covered the New York Paris route from 1976 to the cessation of its operations in 2003 and used it for three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Paris Airport, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space service Nasa, the "X-Plane".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation truly reusable arms".
Uprising in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tippers in Ukraine-affairs
In the Ukraine affair of possible abuse of power by the US President Donald Trump wants to detect possible misplaces in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," said Trump on Thursday in front of employees of the U.S. Embassy at the United Nations in New York. The data subject was almost "a spy" and with this one was "a bit different" in the past than today.
This was considered an intimidation attempt against tipmakers. The event was actually not public. Several US media, however, spread audio recordings from the speech on Friday. Democrats responded indignantly to the statement of the president.
The Democrats in the US representative house had announced preparations for a trial against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who raises serious allegations against Trump and its central government. The reports of the advisor were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, according to which the US President uses "the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country interferes in his favor with the US election in 2020.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate what might harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his sprinkling from Ukrainian justice. Begs are in the race to lead the democratic presidential candidate for the election 2020.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with regard to the Ukraine Telephony also of being protected: leading government staff would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic textual protocol had been made. This had been removed from a commonly provided database and stored in a specially protected system after the consultation of lawyers from the White House. So far, only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the respondent is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote among other things that the "so-called Whistleblower" has distributed information from the second hand, which had turned out to be inappropriate. Therefore, there may not be any tipper or spiner at all.
As Trump said in New York about those who should have contributed information to the Whistleblower, however, outraged. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted worried and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives several months ago, several committees have been conducting investigations against Trump and its environment. In view of Ukraine's allegations, the Democrats are now conducting investigations with new strength to initiate a possible recruitment procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee at the representative house, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of misrepresentation of things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults ship and had demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy sphere, who were working mostly under democratic, but also under republican presidents, stood in a statement published on Friday behind the inquiry by the Democrats into a possible administrative procedure. If the accusations were true, the "a ruthless abuse of power" by Trump, it was said.
There is no precise timetable for the further process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could work on a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on the actual withdrawal of office was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore small. Up to now, no US President has been removed from the office’s impeachment procedure.
VW operating rate: jobs are "sleaking" mined
The VW brand's plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the Automaker's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros. This is supposed to save 500 million euros this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already foresees the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be dismantled by the car manufacturer if it is proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. Moreover, employment security is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now found out from works councils, jobs in production, which are not actually at disposal, are "sleaking" by another route - thus over official course. Thus, freeing regular places would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forced re-employment. Meanwhile, there are many places in which personnel are lacking to increase job compaction, the concerns about the gradual bleeding out of the car plants would be greater. This also raises the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume is done as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardise production worldwide and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and also speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production director Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "In uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves critically firm."
This way it is already successful: for example, this year the cost of production per vehicle would be reduced for the first time since 2013. Before journalists told Tostmann that the production time for the golf 8 was to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production duration do not mention VW, according to information of our newspaper it is around golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg's main plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule that 800,000 cars need to be built there every year, so that the plant is satisfactoryly profitable. In 2018, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems of converting to the new consumption and exhaust gas testing process WLTP.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg a million cars are supposed to roll off the band. This is supposed to make it possible to combine the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is producing the golf production through the conversion to the location for the e-car production.
In addition, SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Gulf and Tiguan last developed downwards. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. Despite all the efforts to build e-mobility, he should remain the Wolfsburger bread and butter car for the first time.
Forced to prostitution by Voodoo: traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been beaten with swearing, dragged into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday to parole and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the foreign Nigerian women had to take a ritual oath in their home country before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought through the Mediterranean by Libyan locks in hoseboats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed on different brothels to work the alleged lock costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, the pay was completely deducted from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the incarceration and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the process. "The work made it physically and psychologically difficult to create women," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were rightly opposed."
The judgments are based on commercial and interrelated confiscation of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, prostitution and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
Fim's ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group threatened Ufo's flight attendant union again with strikes.
Should the company not return to the negotiating table, the trade union would "information about the labour-related measures in the LH group on 14 October," said Ufo-Taharifskontoret Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have for months refused to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo. This also concerns the question of whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
In this regard, Ufo now sees itself strengthened following a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to see that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined to appeal. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo-Government Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to check the status of the Ufo as a trade union. The company argued that the trade union had not appointed a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
Prior to this, there had been a serious leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board had resigned, including the long-standing trade union chief Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended an initial vote on the strike of the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is supposed to change. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia will attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, they want to increase the number of international and local visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, president of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult for tourists. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the orphan kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the oil field of Churais. In the following, national oil production broke dramatically, oil prices shot up. It would take several weeks until the Kingdom's oil production reached its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding celebration
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, Banana-printed suits on Instagram, among other things, and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the promi couple wants to marry ecclesially on the coming weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers held the yes word in a New York stand. There had been no major celebration at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two deaths at plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (methine), the police reported. With the dead it was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had delivered an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of them occur on no other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "dangered", "strongly endangered", "threatening to extinction" and "ended in nature" to "endowed". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Ebersche and Wild Roskastanie Threatened
In Germany, above all, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary Roskastan Islands. Since 2017, they have been considered "dangerous", level two of IUCN-scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan Mining Motte next to a mushroom. Since the 1980s it has spread from south-eastern Europe across the whole continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Roskastans (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 examples. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Species of shrubs and moss also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than one-fifth of the molluscs and moose and almost half of all species of shrubs are threatened, according to IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, of the species involved, agricultural practices and climate change. Soft animals such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and being an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many neglected and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 Victims Reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the information, there was no death. dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the quake on the day before, almost 200 earthquakes have occurred. The starch earthquake 5.8 had rocked the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now that the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes over the past 20 years, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate.
One of the most severe was one of the strengths of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
Already on Tuesday a quake of strength had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira will be performing in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. That's what the singers announced at Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She's very excited to stand on the super-bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be time in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - then she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky during the mid-term show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina." They could hardly expect to "show what we girls can do on the greatest stage in the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to be standing on one of the biggest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday too!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "Kingdoms" were standing on stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched television broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently sunk viewers: In February, the spectacle in the US attracted the least spectators for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the mid-term show of the last Super Bowl, there had been an uproar: In the dispute over dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports last February, Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the Popgruppe Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the critiques were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was kneeling in the 2016/17 season in front of NFL games at the national anthem from protest against police force and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been uncoupled since March 2017 and has no longer opposed the NFL party. He is urging the associations not to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from the insurance
Some banks are expected to face up to the fees of the travel provider Thomas Cook according to a press report. It threatens high subscriptions to outstanding bonds and loans. This also affects Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total write-off of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations of between £900 million and £1 billion and the lenders between £550 and £825 million. The amounts actually written off would be more likely to be at the top of the band, an expert said the sheet.
How great the losses of the creditors will be at the end will show up after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this procedure did not give too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in bad situations. Most money can be picked up with the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it is said.
Rockets are supposed to have brought suspected killers to Italy.
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't have any information on it," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who left them on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, and then a ship of the Italian financial police marched there. On the day the three suspects arrived, too, and the captain was under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. Federal Government Warns Huawei
The head of the US Internet Office Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," said Pai of the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which requires every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to comply with instructions from the security agencies.
Furthermore, the current right prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continued the FCC Chief, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to ask suppliers for a "declaration of trust".
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reported the "Handelsblatt" calling for its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," continued the FCC Chief.
To the Chinese group Huawei, he makes close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai of the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. found out that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the position of the US.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky over a French chemical factory in northern France. The fire is gone after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's scripts will remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the institutions would not open the facilities carefully on Friday, the responsible prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to be exposed to smoke. There was no harm. Farmers and breeders were invited to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the first time.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that smells spread after erasure, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen as well as 90 police officers and gendarmen were in use.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which manufactures additives for oils. The production plant is a few kilometres from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy is part of the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In Italy, Seveso in Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The Prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station Sender BFMTV that it was initially not found to be "high toxicity" in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river dams had been built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out in the early morning around 02.40 o'clock, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest and now"
French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest and now, the sooner the better," said Le Maire at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year on Thursday evening.
The Minister warned that the economy in the Eurozone was weakening.
We must not wait for the economic situation to deteriorate in order to make the necessary decisions."
Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany, that those states that had room for more investment in the budget would have to act.
France did not have these premises, the minister added and pointed to the high debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. The French government debt had to be "stabilised" and "reduced", Le Maire said.
Over the past few years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday foresees tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
This means that the French government responds, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, after which the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson deviates from question to Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "Capital Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament has returned, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson might use a loophole. Addressed to this possibility, the Tory politician, however, turns out.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the law that was last adopted by Parliament, which should prevent this. On a question like that, Johnson simply told journalists that his government would uphold the law in force.
The law provides that the government should apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "Capital Act", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law after the EU's withdrawal. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to reach an agreement."
Johnson’s chief consultant Dominic Cummings explained, however, that he felt the political struggles for Brexit as a “walk in the park” and was confident that the intended EU departure still came: “We enjoy that, we will win, we will (note: Red.: leave the EU) do not worry,” said Cummings of the British newspaper “Telegraph” in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign during the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in the UK government seat Downing Street. He is to be left behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Arizona until she found herself in photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, several hundred of them are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "You wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekov Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the heart: your husband Paul - how you may have never seen him before.
As he danced with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephoned in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but who, beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland, also led a normal life. So Mary McCartney said BBC said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that had stained her father from old potato boxes. And it was tiring up at McCartneys too.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision-making click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to take it at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "Knip you two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift of always catching the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
There the light, the composition, the picture cut-out and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also an anecdotes also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes already seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly created Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite US sanctions imposed against Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a Friday interview that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had "reduced due to the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran particularly on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic. According to the USA, Iran pursues an atomic program in secret and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran.
US Government wants to limit the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the annual ceiling for a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which represents an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while the US would continue to see its commitment to support refugees, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system was overburdened.
In future, the US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus at risk, as stated in the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected from around the world and relocated in the USA. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 is a lowest value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was about 85,000.
Aid organizations were horrified to react to the announced cutoff of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee. The USA would continue to harm its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the US - legally as well as illegally - and the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications according to its own data for the next financial year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Draws close to a pedestal"
US President Donald Trump has accused informant in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever ever accused the informant who accused him of abuse of power has given appropriate clues to "come close to a tip," Trump said according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. That is what several US media agree to.
According to this, Trump spoke to the employees of the U.S. Mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial operations in the White House, he replied: "This is a tip near." Trump added: "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals, we used to deal with this a little differently than we do now."
Observers appreciated the latter remark about a possible appeal to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticised Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. Furthermore, it was an attempt to hinder a congress investigation into a possible recruitment procedure against him, the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Service and Supervisory in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower asks the president in a complaint now published to have abused his office in order to ask for another country to intervene in the US elections in 2020. In concrete terms, among other things, it is his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the discussion Trump suggested to him that investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter be initiated in Ukraine. Trump contests any misbehavior.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Again and again, people try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. There are often too small boats. Now seven migrants have died during the fall of a tubing boat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed during the sinking of a tugboat. Among the victims of death were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men were thus rescued from the floods by the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims should also be a lock, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inouss in the northeast of Chios island. Inouss lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
There are currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations (UNHCR) refugee aid work, 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancels Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of the inconsistency of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should leave it as long as it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey "can't really speak." The audience promised Townsend to come to his expense at a restitution concert. However, an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver scheduled performances, The Who said they would be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only founding members left. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Suddenly set rentals: WeWork lets real estate markets shake
WeWork has risen to the largest office owner in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from small startup to driving force on the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Owners have to fear billions of income.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set off founder Adam Neumann a few days ago as head, moved the planned stock market and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial scope for the coming weeks and months. In addition, among other things, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in part small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at stunning speed. Last year, the company took a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs will have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars by renting new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new management is now supposed to slow down the emergency brake and have stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with a duration of up to 15 years, from which commitments amounting to more than 40 billion dollars arise. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, over the past 24 months, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork's new contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new ones at this time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office learning in the US metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, in London, where WeWork is now operating several dozen office locations in the best position.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be shifted without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house purchased from the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the centre of the financial metropolis last year.
Many landlords have converted their properties to the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billion revenues. Access to WeWork's reserves, however, has not been able to do so despite the long-term lease agreements. Because the rental of the individual sites of WeWork is usually made by subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard once again took action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 wild people who had fished illegally in the waters had been arrested, according to the Russian FSB, the Interfax Agency announced on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Prior to that, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no casualties, it was said.
The North Korean fishermen were thus on their way in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s Coast Guards are based on their own data on the protection of its marine biological resources patrols. In the course of the re-inspections, 30,000 squid had been discovered. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing boats and two motor boats and were taken after Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to Ria Nowosti, the Coast Guard established over 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans even after complaints by local entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also complained recently of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrowly-mashed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also, the ships themselves do not meet the hygiene and technical requirements.
According to Moscow’s three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured in the arrests in the previous week. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean was later killed by his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first captured a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
US entry ban against ex-President Castro
The US has imposed a ban on the entry of former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs justified this in a communication on Thursday with Castro’s involvement in “great human rights violations”. As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he presented a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Armed Forces, the brother of the dead Revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also involved in human rights violations there by the support of President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the previous Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had issued bans against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, there has been a bitter struggle of power between the government and the opposition for months now. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to kneel and help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The Socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the U.S. and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protesters today, thousands of people want to go on the road again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. Due to the shift in time, New Zealand and Australia are expected to start before the protests across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major show in Montreal in Canada, where protesters wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the worldwide appeal will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday we have worked over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far, it has given it in the course of the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany, last Friday’s arrival was very large. According to estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities, a good third of the world’s demonstrators – around 1.4 million – participated in the protests. According to this time, a list of the movement shows that rallyings were planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go on the road for climate change.
At the age of 15 in August 2018, Thunberg had before the Swedish Parliament in order to call on its country's politicians to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. The Fridays-for-Future movement was developed within a short period of time. The climate protests involve students and students in particular, but increasingly scientists and other adults.
Together they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate change. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming had to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees in comparison with pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York about a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic session with a high-sea race hunt. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke in an intrusive way to the heads of state and government of the earth. In her home Stockholm she had been addressed on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This means a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow, according to Tass Agency on Thursday. The ban is to come into force on 1 October.
If you smoke, you have to pay a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette is to light a fire, the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, candles are also burning. Also meat-peeling on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Hitting Cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers from
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time eliminated a large server provider for illegal transactions in the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators suspect that as an operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach have hosted numerous web sites on the Mosel, over which international criminals operate their business.
This was announced by the State Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of suspects are supposed to have been the operators of the world's second-largest Darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which had destroyed investigators in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a server in Cyberbunker, according to the State Attorney General.
Such a hoster had been expelled in Germany for the first time, called it. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and abroad. They have been the result of almost five years of investigations. At midday the investigators want to inform about more details.
New Worldwide Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protesters today, several thousand people want to go on the streets again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallyes in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major demonstration in Montreal in Canada.
Climate protests - who are Thunberg's hindmen?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power man of this time in front of the mirror. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or wise marketing a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulation tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person is able to gain an accumulation of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt delighted to work for a more just world. At that time, he has also been able to gain a crowd of young people and persuades them to cross the sea in order to get to the Promised Land, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made himself on the journey to America by sailing boat.
But there is a shadow side in this regard? Why does it take a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at its side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has sold itself far-reachingly thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also old-fashioned followers of Greta Thunberg were a little dismayed over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick on some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into play in the media worldwide and there is a lot of money flowing thanks to the impressive action.
Here are the spirits: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain circles of persons are working together with stockbrokers during the World Rescue Action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly more important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can certainly make sense to question seemingly early projects by certain trendsets.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is currently crossing through our solar system.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crossed through our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on Crimea. He looked with a self-constructed telescope to heaven and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his species that was sighted during transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights from the vicinity into a strange solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola that takes him out of our system.
Comet has already been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in detail. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights about Comet 2I/ Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. Two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, possibly allowing a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and became dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely repugnant": Rachel Johnson abducted over brother
Boris Johnson gets lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the Cabinet, now his sister is bickering with clear words the war language of the Prime Minister as "savourless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to equip - at least verbally. During Question Time in the House of Commons on this Wednesday, this was due to massive indignation of the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the broadcaster Sky News, her brother, to use words such as surrender, as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal were to be "hanged, pulled, quartered, bullied and feathered". They thought it was extremely disgusting. They did not recognize the version of their brother again, said Rachel Johnson, who had taken the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
She was particularly concerned that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly lower house member who had been murdered by a neonazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. Their memory could best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the lower house. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'British First'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the extreme right camp who felt "encouraged by this kind of language". For all those who mourned around her, it was very unpalatable.
The widower of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister harshly. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used that way," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to enter passionately and decisively into what one believes - no matter what one thinks. But never should one "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen that attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had lowered his post as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory's deputy. "I had been torn between loyalty to family and national interest in the past few months - it is an insoluble tension," explained Jo Johnson.
Johnson’s language also came up with sharp criticism in the Church. As the “Times” reports, all 118 bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language which is “this country is not worthy of.” In a common statement they stated: “In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to one another”.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is a strong sign: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots, promising an "explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has incredible strength in the USA," Shakira told in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. Many people live with Latin American roots in the metropolis of Florida’s southern tip. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl to stage two women this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. In 2001 she achieved her worldwide breakthrough with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected with excitement every time in the USA. This year, many are also seen as political gestures. Finally, the country, not least through President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones were there for fear. Usually, the NFL finals watch well over 100 million TV viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year there were political controversys in the run-up. The reason was the dispute around the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise against blacks in protest against police force during the play-off of the national anthem, and had been hard hit by US President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl appearance – including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 occurred was ultimately criticised by many.
An actor and Youtuber joins Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali stays abroad, but rather.
The two men who influence the flow of blood on the streets of Egypt again spent the last week abroad. One of them again swung at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In 2013, the ex-General, who abandoned the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisi’s action against political Islam and lost no silver on the human rights violations at the Nile – in a week in which Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had “no cause for concern,” said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of the state television. “The Egyptians did not let themselves lead into the Irish”.
This is what the president of the other man, who is currently dedicating what is happening on the streets, is trying to mislead Mohamed Ali. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he withdraws from the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-giving voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and tea rooms of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sissi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president is in luxury and let himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, based on Sisi's rule, puts Ali corrupting and enriching. Because he spent 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor with exactly this gentlemen's business, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - that is at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the directly exploding click figures show.
After the last week, after Sisis's arrest after the power had demonstrated thousands against his rule, nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that there were so many people on the streets. However, there were isolated minor protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants threw Al-Sisi corruption and demanded his resignation. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were initially not independently verified. Security circles said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters broke banners last week with the president's portrait, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the highways. In Cairo several subway stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work", most roads around the Tarir Square, the heart of the 2011 Revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which in 2013 followers of the overthrown Muslim brother Mursi were huddled until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent the gathering of dissatisfaction: Sisy's party of the future wanted to hold a large conference for the president here.
Mohamed Ali caused these precautions to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the tari court," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collide with police officers." But as a withdrawer, this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
It seems that the internet connection is always much slower than the provider has applied for, there are different testing possibilities.
If you enter into an Internet contract, you do not need to blindly trust the supplier’s speed specifications. Customers can even check how much of it is actually achieved in case of uplifts.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore also be achieved, the Consumer Centre for Bavaria explains.
If the connection appears to be much slower than requested by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the agreed rate.
"However, the testing of suppliers is carried out in accordance with supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," says the Consumer Centre for Bavaria.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance. This is best done in writing by the parties involved by filing an objection.
Even after several requests, customers can cancel and may also claim damages. However, if there is no success, only the claim path will help.
First High Republisher for Investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has expressed himself for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it is leading from here, is determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump observed bids "for years".
Republicans have so far been holding back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort because of this. Scott’s comments are a first sign of Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already objected to Trump’s policy several times, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening up of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays at the MCU: Further Marvel-Film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This report is consistent with several U.S. media. Therefore, the film should also be recorded: In the USA, the film will start as of July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I am pleased that Spidery's path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue working on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, because Sony continues to work on his Spidery verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? It is said that Sony Marvel has offered an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, also belonging to Marvel, would participate in the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man films with 30 percent. However, the news is not confirmed.
That's how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appeared in the "Suits" finals.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the big finale. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was crowned in a charming manner. Attention, the following sections included Spoiler for the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects showed once again the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or as she greeted him after his death imprisonment.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" final, incidentally, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is heading straight towards Altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a pluralistic remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw himself over a robe, Harvey wanted to know about the bridegroom, just to note: "Louis, you are not the prince of England."
Eggeis: Baby and four other children drowning in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned in the Kenter of a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousse, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister of Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he would like to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform himself in Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help in tackling them.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofers with the EU Commissioner for Internal Affairs Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey still arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, called it the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in the figures last raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who are illegally crossing Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each of the Syrians who had been deported.
However, the handling of applications for asylum is difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have almost 29 400 people. Lesbos is the worst situation: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a camp with capacities for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 has there been so many of them, the government broadcasting reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will continue to test the health system. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years, says Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Above all, the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperature rises within a short time and led to increased heart attacks. People with cardiovascular diseases, older people and diabetics are particularly affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photopanne.
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup being manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally it was noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held his hand. On the party’s website she was on a photo with this cup to see in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also been distributed to the media - and there was a beaker (pap) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chef has to answer for photopanne.
The National Post then threw manipulation before May and that the party manufactures Fake News to appear more credible in the topic of "environmental protection". And this in the middle of a campaign to vote under house, in which Trudeau too is increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and highlighted the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cups".
May showed herself shocked and claimed on their blog to have no knowledge of this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, the one who put it right was from bamboo. She always brought it in. A spokesman of the party said it was just about putting the party logo in the picture, and not hiding something. From the photo is just a cut-off on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time she asked herself some of her team: "If they want to work on a picture again, they couldn't do anything with my face, so that I look younger?"
The German Greens have also been hit because of their use of disposable plastic or flight trips in Shitstorms, but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, on holiday ice with plastic spoons, as reported by Merkur.de*.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was assured of an upgrade by e-mail from Cathay Pacific. However, when she asked to check in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan to get an upgrade for the Business Class - many of them dream of. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class free of charge.
This case, however, shows how it should not be done: A self-explained influencer actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline even though she had shown a mail in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly showed an upgrade in view. Writing wanted to have received the influencer from an airline’s marketing staff. On the other hand, the airline accused Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were sceptical: they were following up at the central station. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail was alleged to be coming should have rejected the mail contact with Jaqueline. That was also confirmed by the mail system in which the news did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about $1,280), she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Although Cathay had refunded the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencerin has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Airline's terms and conditions also state that they do not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now activates an attorney.
According to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen, oil prices give
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Last time a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American type West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the cruise was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought about five percent of the world's oil production. The Huti rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had announced the attacks. Saudi Arabia is making like the US government responsible to Iran. An armistice would ease the political tension in the region.
If an agreement was actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand care, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw material strategy department at the Saxo Bank of the news agency Bloomberg.
Oil prices thus continue its downward movement over the past few days. One week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent nearly 65 dollars.
Finally, Bloomberg had reported under appeal to Insider that after the attack in mid-September, repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had progressed faster than expected. Consequently, the production volume had reached a volume of eight million barrels a day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases calling for insiders to report on rapid progress made by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid planning and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepared the departure while the ship was still in front of anchor, Erik Hånell told Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the U.S. announced that defence missiles and soldiers would move to Saudi Arabia as an archenemy of Iran. The fear of escalating between the Islamic Republic and countries like the United States and Great Britain had significantly increased oil prices over the past few weeks.
Murder Against Trump Sharpened
In the affair of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, cover charges against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials had tried intensively to prevent access to the language of the conversation after a disputed telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. That was an anonymous informant. The spokesperson of the representative house, the democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "disposal". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that in the nuclear dispute it will soon come to a third summit of Maj Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the North Korean Foreign Minister's adviser. He also criticized tightening US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the USA and South Korea. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "might" decision of Trump to bring it closer.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he explained himself. Negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been on the rise since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the talks, but to date without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers are supposed to help in mine clearance
With a blue splitter vest, the British Prince Harry in Angola symbolically set fire to a bomb mine and destroyed it. Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at Dirico’s site, he produced the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola through 2025 mine-free, he later called for ongoing TV cameras: “I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to get out of the road to help”.
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a rapid reduction in interest rates, the pound is losing value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations about an early interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) increase sterling's pound. On Friday, the British currency declined by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269.
As a result of the sales, the statements made by the banker Michael Saunders brought into discussion a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy at a foreseeable time. This statement is surprising because Saunders applied as a champion of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelist of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the burden on the economy by the Brexit Hickhack, without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country, if not without a divorce agreement, from the EU on 31 October.
More: With its provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Materials from the Moscow analysis laboratory are being manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Taking Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Athletics Association.
New details of the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light at the start of the World Athletics World Cup - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and only in a way. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the world anti-doping agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been exposed in Russian sport. The Wada had blocked the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual testing at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had about 270 athletes from the country under neutral flag, while 168 Russian athletes were at the start of the winter games in February 2018. Also at the World Cups in the various sports, they were allowed to attend, in summer in Russia even the football World Cup with the host.
Missing positive findings
In the following September, the Wada re-opened the Rusada track, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state baptism. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the athletics association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Newspaper" of Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Vada has received from a whistleblower, and those that it has received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing which had been mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup was not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to hold on to the banner of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in space and had asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new block of Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
