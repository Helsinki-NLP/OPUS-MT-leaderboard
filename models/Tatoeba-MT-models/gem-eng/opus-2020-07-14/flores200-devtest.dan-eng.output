This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs who had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown at the top with a light or carrot-coloured underside.
The find also gives insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well - developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other characteristics from feathers - rays and biscuits - the scientists derived that the feather shaft was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the removal suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not a chicken down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chicken down.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two policemen and hurting more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with regard to magnetic turns.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal forces between the galaxy's dark substance and the dark substance of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers could conclude that the dark substance affects other dark substance in the same way as the common substance does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was reason for alarm due to its very high mortality."
Some patients may have received the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health professionals.

In her second large slalom race, she ended in the tenth place of the women's sitting group with a total term of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place woman, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyangyi Dani from Hungary, who finished at the ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's group for seated performers did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in large slalom did not rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy General D. K. Arya said, "We've arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we've found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Politician Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solangi told me that the accused met in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them got hurt.
The driver, however, suffered serious injuries in his head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering his son.
She is in custody and is waiting to be tried and brought to trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be misplaced because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of images potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful if they publish pictures of suspects and so on."
The Crown Office, which has the overall responsibility for prosecution, has suggested to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the prosecution is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants, based on the borders prior to the six-day war in 1967.
Other subjects covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, as well as the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Protectors of the additional pest control attempt should be closely monitored by the park officials when the study was monitored and its effect evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sports Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Director of Nature Conservation and Cultural Heritage in NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
A new Provisional Election Council (CEP) of nine members was yesterday sworn in by Martelly.
It's Martyly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martyl's response to the extensive anti-regime protests that began in October was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, which has caused a total of six fires and given four persons minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (METI) informed that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "probably regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marian Emergency Office informed that no damage had been reported in the nation.
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong as hostages by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 against the tourists.
More hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early and also the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an older lady's seat when she was going to the bathroom.
Liegins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He graduated as an obstetrician and began working in 1959 at Auckland National Women's Hospital.
While he was working at the hospital, Lieggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the development of the baby’s lungs at embryonic stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two black boxers on Wednesday.
Other breakers also hailed Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died at night with two moons. Quite unique, like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... loves her and comes to miss her... hopefully she's a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people interviewed prior to the federal elections in 2010, the number of those who are opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Constituent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the federal elections in 2010 that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of them share this view in the study, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
In the various extremes of the vote, 29 per cent of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner had to swim in the style 100 m and 200 m free and in three staffs at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there has been doubt about his condition.
He could not take the medication needed to combat his pain, as these are prohibited under the doctors.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on 25 January the largest known prime numbers to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Kometer may have been a source of water on earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed last month a bill that legalized marriage for people of the same sex.
He referred to the rumors as "political carnival and foolishness."
You wonder if he's acting as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel a year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on radars on Earth, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is inserted and the trains above the ground will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on earth.
The fear of non-transport raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A Thursday study published in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin finke geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin cable which can be twisted and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The coolant changes color, all depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The PH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ion (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Brintions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, and then press them together into a bullet with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers that will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost all houses,
Residues of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the room receives the call and reflects it down again almost immediately.
The satellite was sent out into the space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or a telescope in space requires a huge rocket that is over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster methods of transport.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey that ranges from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including loose domestic cats) eat the much more numerous small prey animals such as insects, rodents, quails, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cat animals and live in large groups called flocks.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and infants.
The females are normally closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks react very much like wolves or dogs in flocks, animals that are surprisingly like lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (but not well), swim, jump far and draw with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger’s roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of snarling, screaming words.
Ocelots prefer small animals, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it itself.
Researchers believe that ocelot follows and finds animals to eat (exchange) via smell, by sniffing to where they have been on earth.
They can see very well in the darkness with night vision, and they also move very quietly around. Ocelots hunt their prey by walking in one with their surroundings and then throw themselves over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) are separated from the main population they came from (as if they move over a mountain chain or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different functions or adjustments in order to be a stronger competitor than would previously have been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, while the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups of the population will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our houses of plants and we make clothes of plants, and most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing but other mosaics.
Its long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of the mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a divided tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaics, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would have nothing to do with it.
Although most of their food would be known to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a seven - dormant.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on their chairs, the rich men could enjoy having big party meals together, where they lay on the side while they were eating.
Old Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or Asia for centuries.
For example, they had neither maize, tomatoes, potatoes, nor cocoa, nor had any of the ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of the God.
People sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests had to enter.
Sometimes pyramid - shaped towers, known as ziggurates, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate in the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of its life outdoors.
Women made the food in the farm; the shops were just open dishes that turned out towards the street. Stones were used to build houses with them.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was inhabited with few people. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, there were already indigenous tribes in the area at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a tax card is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written behind on the document, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned on its head.
Although no one knows with warranty who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the remark was simply attached as an addition.
The D-day landings and the subsequent battles had freed northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had freed southern France and were focusing on Germany.
Civilisation is a single culture divided by a larger, significant group of people who live together and cooperate, a society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilisation, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state; and it also defines the size of society in some way.
Urban states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization involves the transfer of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as real civilisations.
During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed first a weak central government — with Congress as the only component — under the articles of the Confederacy.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, they were dependent on the state authorities who were often not cooperative in enforcing all acts.
It also had no right to disregard tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles called for unanimous approval by all States before they could be changed, and the States took the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
Italy’s national football team, together with Germany’s national football team, is the world’s second most successful team and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skate hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the world’s 7th largest island!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often designated, from a geographical point of view, as a "sea group".
Taiwan's history begins all the way back in the 15th century, when European seafarers on their way past the island named the Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which started a change of the original cereal production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan in 1885 to be a province of Qing-Imperiet.
In 1895 after a defeat in the 1st Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Peace of the Shimonoseci Treaty, with which it renounced the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which reigns over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the temple of the Sun and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the excavations continue that day.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is still images of 35 mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the era of analogue films.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the most simple integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. the APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The highly abused and often ridiculed third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while keeping a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of Europe’s history, the Catholic Church, which had become prosperous and influential, was examined.
For over a thousand years, Christian religion united European countries in spite of different languages and customs.
Its universal power influenced everyone from king to ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s financial resources should be used specifically for this purpose.
The Church’s central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after the hostilities broke out, Britain launched a barrier to the sea against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching; this blockade was contrary to the recognised international laws codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain put mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unlimited submarine war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations’ attitudes leaned against pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to work with Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his former job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were shown in a unique way; each Chinese period of time or every family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the epoch of three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought over the throne.
The period of the Three Kings was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat of the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metering system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, making it possible for the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on calibre.
The French revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relation to worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to deepen himself in his thoughts.
The hole itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The hill is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know that it exists, when you're inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
Only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. A little of the outside world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The great pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The great pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Dead Valley of Egypt, contains several pyramids (the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small graves, several temples and the great Sfinks.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, graves and temples were built in honor of Khufu’s wives and family members.
The "up-turn" mark looks like a V and the "down- arc-mark" look like a staple, or a square missing its lower side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow down and start at the seed (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Stroke usually produces a softer sound, while downstroke sounds stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed arch markings are determined for musical reasons, why they should usually be respected.
The horrified King Louis 16, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Mrs Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a car surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats to the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep the windows in their cart completely open.
At one point a member of the mafia showed the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles, to the frightened queen.
The cost of the American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial power to raise money to the majority of the costs, and the bond interest ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the super-profits from the long-standing exploitation of the Filipino people would be the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the temple knights, you need to understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The time period during which these events took place is commonly known as the Middle Ages, the part of Europe's history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Middle Ages preceded the early Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is an expression that embraces a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity to a narrow idea that man's fate is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws, as well as the way in which they evolve into technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a route largely outside cultural or political influence and that technology, in turn, has a "impact" on societies that are hereditary and not socially dependent.
For example, it can be said that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically profitable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many own cars, road accidents also happen, leading to inventions of new techniques in the field of health to heal body damage.
Romance contained a large element of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romance it was the geography that formed the individual, and over time customs and cultures arose that were related to geography, and these were in harmony with the position of society and were therefore better than arbitrary laws imposed.
Just as Paris today is known as the capital of modern - day fashion, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known as an epicenter of luxury since about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1,100 C.E.
Its status fell in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title as fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most widespread between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothes were highly inspired by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the western styles were able to slow backwards by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to put clothes on.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the eco-region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsisting agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel that they are being overlooked by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic due to age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of several factors.
Persons belonging to a subculture often signal their belongings through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and hoses.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children have not been socialized by adults in their childhood through failure, accident or deliberate neglect.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some ferocious children have been deprived of liberty by humans (often their own parents); in some cases this infant error was caused by the parents’ rejection of the serious intellectual or physical impairments of a child.
Wild children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before leaving or running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When it is raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical boundaries) that is almost similar to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest for humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Stilling is not a method of learning, but a support for people who need to learn new - for example, using a new computer program or starting a project.
Stillads can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a kind of scaffold, but it's the little paper clips-man in Microsoft Office as well.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software, and aim to question, ask and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come in nursing families for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nutrition, care and education, but they do anyway.
We regard the care family system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe home, loving care providers, stable education and reliable health care.
A nursing family has the task of providing all the necessities that were not found in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions of use and satisfaction.
For example, it is proposed that "learning" and "socialisation" are important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal participation" and "permanent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in understanding micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-phrases.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such ability to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as man’s satisfying his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are prepared.
Conversely, animal feed (pigs, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of conscious waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet wake-up clock to bring you to consciousness without completely waking you up.
If you experience turning off the clock while sleeping, you can place it in the other end of the room, which forces you to get up to turn it off.
Other biothermal options include drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces you to get up and let the water.
The amount of inner peace, a person’s possession, is quite the opposite of the amount of tension a person has in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. All humans have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but was extended by the love path mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple; it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened to live (information energy) through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Centre for Tibetan Meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various divinities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of information is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to be over the next 40 years and would be fought seriously by destitute armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost obsolete from one day to the next, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Attack Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most effective way of transporting large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the opportunity to move your people and your goods, while at the same time affecting your enemy’s ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to ship soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as you know, goats were tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Old cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skin.
Husgedes were generally kept in flocks that walked on hills or other pastures, often monitored by goat shepherds who were often children or teenagers, corresponding to the more widely known shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, wagons were built in England.
Although the carriageways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly uneven roads of the day.
Sweller was invented quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, one gradually realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron led to more wear on the wheels of the vehicles.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used, made exclusively of metal.
The first known method of transport was to walk, people began to ascend two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means resurrected man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, were not usually resurrected.
There are two-boned specialisations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have gone on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even act as activists to reduce future suffering to a certain degree.
This is in many cases like the treatment of symptoms, but if we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's extravagant way of life.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by the president of the Congress of John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon on July 8 at Independence Hall's farm.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9, he received a copy for his soldiers in New York City.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one out of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits, to now use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms of vomiting are far too general that a diagnosis can be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medical container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific instructions on first aid for the specific poison.
The expression bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression stems from old knowledge of wallgelus, which is insects that live extensively as parasites on humans.
Both predators and bedding elephants are nidico-free, meaning they are adapted to stay in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the risk of getting MS than men.
A couple can decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
By adoption the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over them.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue for a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the subject with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the subject with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are Germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape and plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation and visits to parks, as well as studies of information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where tomorrow people leave small villages by car to go to their workplaces and pass by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry all are connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonised economy has eluded the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development over a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost all complaints about the transport systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges that collapse.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic current is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction.
Unfortunately, traffic flows are difficult to study because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent safety.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic is typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, the three main characteristics are: (1) current, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road systems.
Insects were the first animals to fly to the weather. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today the goldsmith and the diurnal fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
There were divided opinions about his theory - some felt that he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because we can't feel the earth turning around, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second largest river on earth, containing more than 8 times as much water as the earth’s second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is some places up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet’s rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6.387 km (3,980 km).
Although the pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the old kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size and technical expertise of their constructions.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their forefathers, who at that time were well and well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican State is about 800. It is the least independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican State are Roman Catholic.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig after if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely soil, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four modes of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they are changing to new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the sentence that ends this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a good friend for most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now write messages through computer screens and never have to get anywhere near a pencil tip.
You can only guess what to get from the keyboard when something new comes to it.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, and when the nucleus splits again, something of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they tend to collapse under little or no influence.
The moon's surface is made of stone and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The scorpion is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more moon garden on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
Theories examine what it is about certain people who make them do certain actions and what elements of their environment make them perform or refrain from performing certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of need pyramid, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there may be two ways of behaviour when a manager starts to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
This type of leader has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and keeping people responsible.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she needs to change everything that the team has accomplished and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
There are similar expectations for virtual team expertise as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organisation? One of the objectives of translating organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity start to appear when all available resources are used efficiently across the functional departments of an organisation.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to address an obstacle may lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers must create a culture that promotes innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuum access as a method that can help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The relationship between the pathology and behavior of the brain supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models with which can help us to understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controls, planning and schedules, the ability to respond to customer diagnosis and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military business areas, since it has been built into several home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a large part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a trip virtual is also a good method of evaluating an excursion and sharing experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their journey to the capital of the state, and every year the website is rebuilt, but old versions are still available online as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogge can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often start their blog-experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience in general corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author begins trying to improve himself in writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "forcing blogging students to become smarter on the world around them." The requirement to give the audience what they want inspire students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students to become more analytical and critical; giving active responses to Internet materials can enable students to define their roles in relation to what others have written and to describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that exhibit Canada's past and present.
Farther south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to Muskoka and the natural beauty of other areas.
All these things, as well as several, highlight Ontario as what is considered to be genuine Canadian by outsiders.
Longer northerly, there are large areas that are rather thinly populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent for itself when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are connected with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and religion was rapidly spread on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gamas discovering the Cape route between Europe and India.
In the north the region borders up to Sahel, and in the south and west to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look like animals.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would view as harassment, and it is not abnormal to be persecuted, gripped by the arm, etc.
Be determined when you reject men, and do not be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berbian fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, leaving it only after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants as established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tags, ceramics, leather goods, vandpiber and a wide range of nips, but it is very touristic.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets in particular in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be examined in order to understand the struggles taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for increasing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda boda (motorbike taxa) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese franc for the short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, removing its own.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added the list of threatened world heritage sites because of the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the larger stops under Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border to Mozambique towards east and Zimbabwe towards north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19.500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different animal life.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance and access fees to the park.
It may also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South Africa national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus area.
Hong Kong's skyline is a group of buildings that, when reflected in the water in Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering column chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon port front on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is closely packed on populated land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made for their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast and entering Bangladesh and India's hinterland.
Sundarbans has been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. That part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarban's National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangroves — they include some of the last remaining avalanches of the mighty forests that once covered the perennial plains.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third are covered by water/mosis areas.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wild reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal kingdoms and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
There are buses from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Deletaxas are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, for example Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge that extends over the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guyana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The building was completed in August 2011. It opened first for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control items are expected to be finished.
The Guaranians were the most important group of natives who lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomatic hunters who also cultivated agriculture to survive.
The Chaco region was the home of other groups of native tribes such as Guaycurúerne and the Payaguas, which survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, which was formerly called the "Great Province of India", came to the world in the 16th century as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native populations.
The Spanish started the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polobans in Las Cañitas.
Even smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments as well as where to buy tickets, check with Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed at the value of a UK pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted.
In the other islands, credit cards are unlikely to be used, although British and American currencies may be used; ask the owners in advance to know which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so make sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, when it is winter on the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
The winter can be misleading cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what is on the thermometer.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, animal life is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you have to get at least 100 yards/metres away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals!
No matter how flexible they look, bison, elk, bears, and virtually all big animals can attack well.
Every year a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port formed a framework for a notorious fleet confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship, almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular is located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most common local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the new Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
Drinking the local water from the tap is absolutely safe, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
For Australians the idea is of a "flat white" coffee stranger. A "short black" is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but on the other hand excellent.
Many visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of the authorities, read and observe advice on signs, and give great attention to safety warnings.
Seaweeds occur near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and want to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-reservation gives the traveller peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers at certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transportation arrangements or even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the participants choose to camp on site for music festivals, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be there where it's going, you need to get in early to get a tent space close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big scenes is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
Check out where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic in winter, as sailing through ice can noise quite a bit, for those closest.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempted from visa requirements (see the conditions), which is nice to know when cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can for guests to spend as much time and as much money as possible. Windows and watches are usually not present and it may be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered at the house’s expense, but fullness weakens judgment, and all genuine gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who is going to run at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and minus degrees.
On ice and slippery roads there is low friction, and you cannot drive as you would normally do, on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow may drop in a very short time to get you stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic glides mostly undisturbed all year round.
Safari is the highlight of many people and may be what attracts most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the safari.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the cars, so standard equipment is enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes cloudy, and you can better see them with a binocular.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, "go-safari" or "safari on foot") consists of walks that take either a few hours or several days.
The paralympic games take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo became the only Asian city to have been for two summers-OL, as it was also for the doctors in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020 when the OL was planned.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, where typical tickets cost around 7,000.
Ironing humid clothing can help to dry it. Many hotels have a iron and ironing board that you can borrow even if there is not one in the room.
If you do not have the possibility to use a iron or if you do not like to wear socks that are ironed, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the substance get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burn marks).
There are different ways to clean water in which some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency and if you are concerned you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they do not know from home.
Injury can destroy food, cause irritation or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill humans, are not normally considered pests.
Customs-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods specific places that are exempt from taxes.
Travelers who are on their way to countries with a high tax rate may sometimes save considerable amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often goes through isolated terrain in the backland.
Be alert if you are not used to driving by road: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns are plenty of.
The speed limits laid down are remarkably lower than on lines before and after — typically 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) — and it is even more important than normal to observe them accurately.
