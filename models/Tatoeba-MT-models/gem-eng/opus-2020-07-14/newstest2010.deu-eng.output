Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
US President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the North Road metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visits the Nobel Institute where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
After that, the presidents and Queen Sonja planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V.
In the afternoon, the visit reached its climax with the ceremony, during which Obama takes the prestige prize.
He receives this as the fourth U.S. president, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House already announced that Obama will speak about the Afghanistan war when the price is taken over.
The President does not want to deviate from this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a President who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, he stepped up the efforts of war by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gol medal, the diploma and the cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete karitative work.
The event programme then foresees a banquet with the president and his wife, where, apart from Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the start to the price.
He said, for example, that he has the feeling that he doesn't quite deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all who strive for the same values as he does.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was "call for action" for him.
Protectors of nature are accused of extortion
Leitmeritz-Polizei accused the head of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for extortion.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors to his favor, said the Leitmeritz Police Officer, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaftist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting garbage container in Brno don't smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find again on foot and step the sortier trash container.
And in Brno?
There you would have to book a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage bins.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors are not taking sufficient care of this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is in the waste streams in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting container, but above all because of the number of garbage tunnels for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a Samm milk basket, for example, in the center?
It's just art, it takes time and strong nerves from everyone.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the Moravia Square opposite Gans.
Mr Unterka should not annoy us his colleagues, but this is far too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honey lick in other parts of the world.
Whole rows of my friends therefore rather not sort the waste at all.
It's a mistake.
Because it's too far to the trash cans.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But in terms of visibility, I didn't see any paint bins on the Konicova Street.
Luckily, I got to the right place while driving a tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, is it not?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us ashamed throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno really is the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has deducted the money for pensions and health benefits
After the Left Party gave farmers and officials more money in spite of the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sick pay and construction savings.
But neither for public debt rates nor for international court disputes.
This is causing even more problems to those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have enforced the salary increase for some groups, they calculated that the government is paying the money for the delicate expenses, old-age pensions or for the health allowance. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mine lay," says Janota.
Of the loans, there are always higher interest rates, and you have to pay back the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the state fund is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children too.
People don't have to be afraid that they'll get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - in the next year there will be not only 163 billion missing in the state fund, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase faster and faster and, together with it, the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its area fictitious package.
Because of the turnout in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections obtained in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and, possibly, begrudged.
Most of all, what is not free of charge.
This means a delay or a cancellation of thirty large buildings, which is also a threat to Europe's wealth, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the drain of money in a Salomonic way - it attacks the CEZ shareholders, where the state is the majority's owner, and from which the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion on the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP, in accordance with EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the upheavals.
The budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings, fell nearly three billion.
Whether the state can do without this money is not sure.
It's just a game of luck.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save the money in-house or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two billion "State Fund" project, which should allow to monitor on-line, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Finance Minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will be changing Android within a few seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that the American society intends to introduce VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on your phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both of them will work in parallel, according to Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware during an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not fiction.
VMware successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which simultaneously the mentioned systems run Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The VMware company is now working with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the customer is due to come the devices within 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains tortures the hotel owners
Scneeless slopes are not only worried about the Giant Mountains inhabitants.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they're afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we believe this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mash", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Those who want the New Year's stay in the spindle mill exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer to save and when the quality of your stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think they'll try to sell them for a while, but then they too have to give in, and enter into shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, estimated Jandura.
The Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi always offers free beds at all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, led the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The New Year's Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are less free places here.
Good sales can also be found the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes be snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the New Year's stays, Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year of January, for which we are already already employed about 60 percent.
A little weaker is between February, but when the snow comes, the interest in the stay in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch, led.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow shower.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, Jiri Jakubsky was informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is the Mother of Wisdom
It is almost comical, with which student striving Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it off about the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that he himself uses the word "just like in Iraq" several times in the text, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward", without daring.
Three years ago, he himself sent out the Bush idea - fresh troops quotas in Iraq tortured by the civil war - as a "unresponsible and in her subsequent Karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush Strategy, which was the only possible and successful outcome of the military recommendations, was that today's news about Iraq was no longer spoken.
The call of Bush was not improved by this, for objectively he left behind his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the military quota, the military again asked him, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, harshly criticized the soothing shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he betrayed the general whiist about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the promise for another 5,000, even if he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
His plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months is extremely problematic throughout the Obama Strategy, and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Even despite the fraternal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to change their opinions every day.
The political institutions, although they have been formally properly established, remain purely sham buildings, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the intransigence of the conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran.
Also, building a "actable state", which is the minimalistic goal of the entire operation, is very unrealistic.
Obama Strategy Time horizon alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further, and now it is on the edge of the explosion.
In doing so, believe that the little soldiers who have broken out in the war cry about the "Friendly Homecoming" create a miracle here, can only create a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept that as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is declining.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents the way in which Germany's or Italy's security is linked to the war in the Hindrushch region's foreland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iranians do not work, the United States will have a very serious question as to whether the problem is not to be solved by troops.
This question needs to be answered in the period in which America steps to Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation pad for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and as a result, enough time remains for him to take a different strategy.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, but it is only allowed to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be removed from managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
According to the Reuters Agency, Goldman Sachs is taking the lead in the efforts to connect the Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism, after she had set aside almost $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters Agency, the overall level of premium bonuses this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the banker's bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once at a rate of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the technical categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer was also Romanian descent, Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
Together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, the Israeli Ada Jonah received the prize for chemistry for information on the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao, for research in the fiber-glass field, and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, gave away this prize for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prizewinners received the diploma, Nobel medals and certificate of purchase of the money price.
It amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American president, Barak Obama, received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and is also at the top of the country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is contemplating his stay in government on Friday because he is not in agreement with the execution of the next year's state budget in the form that was released by the Assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining Janota in the Cabinet will be the subjects of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also further deepens the public finances crisis.
The President-in-Office, Radim Okhat, informed about the meeting.
About his further stay in function Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which is now being signed to Klaus, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party proposals on the conversion of funds and increased the money for public officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that it conceals the increase in the budget deficit.
On the one hand, between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Right Party on the other hand, there has been a sharp domestic political dispute, which raises the question mark about the further work of the Fisherman Office cabinet, on which the ODS, CSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the fishermen's government in the autumn, which, in their understanding, is to end the debt of the state.
Klaus, who is able to sign the State Budget Act, but he does not have to, said today, in the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem", which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a longer period of time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, said that the budget is cruel, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the CSDD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial team as "strong statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek word that the budget deficit was horrendous that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, and it exceeds 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSD evaluated the approval of the state budget for the next year as success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" of the world shows much about the country, from whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life by the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the one and nineties-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood movie.
Matt Damon has another significant role to play.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which at the end has become the slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who still lives and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeated", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak.
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to reach agreement on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided according to apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through the sport, so he decides to some of the rugby players who belong to the outsiders around the world.
Finally, the South African team rises until the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out when I shook your hand, I took over your energy, it's transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to have become another person.
Matt Damon presents in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar in his house for the first time.
I remember when I called the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared to their actual role models, under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeatn" he has received positive reviews and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his analysis in the following words: "That was a very good story, very well executed film."
In the movie reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light Secret over Norway: Russians have tested a rocket
Over Norway there was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the rocket called the type "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site during the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, it is already written about "Bulava" as about a "racete that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights up
This already 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage to the rocket occur.
It is believed that the engine exploded at the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" started out of the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which was under the water of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the U-boat to be fired.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object across the North Road was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, since the first moment the Norwegians have not doubted that this is a Russian missile.
Generality has protected itself this time and claims that one cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall off and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without errors, the management of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and is probably already in the Friday dual KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who has completed his career for forty years in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some other formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergey Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, led fellow players Nemcinov up.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of forty-one and was able to credit himself with 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice over his head in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave up the unions. All overtimes are cancelled.
The management of the Nosovice Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Because of frequent overtime the union announced on Monday the willingness to strike.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to reach agreement with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, therefore on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take a spare holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek performed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning point with regard to the demands and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk opened.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift 2 more hours.
Once the agreement has been signed, the union will withdraw its willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be willing to lift the strike.
Last week, last Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory got worse when about 400 employees were striking spontaneously for constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management argued, however, that employees must make overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unions also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production on the previous Wednesday in their Monday strike call.
In the field of overtime, trade unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they charge 5000 crowns this year.
Hyundai's Nosovice Automobile Factory now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production was started in the company last November.
Until this September, around 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ́steeled ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage of the fact that the combination does not work as strongly in normal viral variants as one of the already existing medicines.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the patient can prolong the drug compilation and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral reproduction results in the development of resistant viruses that are no longer active.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein that is responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalokarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block viral proliferation in ways other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new 'improved' compounds, prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-ply cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home-grown and stable virus
HIV protease is an HIV protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, no mature infectious viral particles would occur.
When we switch off the HIV protease, we also disable the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists in the press report, which was published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of connections in which two pairs of the cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease assays tested in the test tube also against its stable (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarbane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants, which are often ineffective in the use of medicinal products.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical designs, makes the metalocarbanes interesting compounds for further development of effective anti-HIV medicines, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting for budget. ODS started on fishermen who resisted
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget "grayful" for the next year and the government of the Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider their further existence in his opinion.
The statement by the ODS was called by the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
Petr Necas, Vice-Chairman of ODS, said that the concept of the cabinet of officials with the support of the CSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he is going to remain in office with the help of Parliament's links.
The approach of the ODS and the social democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, according to which Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with Linkpartiar amendments over over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for government salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that it conceals the increase in the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a minimum of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has responded to the government's request, because the amended budget is only a less poor version of the budget provisorium.
Disillusionment and Insanity
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to withdraw in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominations of the Social Democracy (CSSD), which had implemented the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government to what extent fishermen are in favour of the further fight with the budget deficit.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the service bill.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, has highlighted Topolanek in a US text message.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy function who confessed to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to refrain from the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left who are currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it is up to me, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS withdrew at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Mr Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister expressly asked Members of the citizens' democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We are not orphans, we are not young children, so he then replied to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I did not have the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, above all, it would be about the Bolshevikisation of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), less trains will drive for approximately the same fare.
The Czech Railway terminates or restricts from 13 December some less used fast and local trains, while other connections are reinforced.
The total volume of transport is reduced by two percent from the validity date of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs, including base and customer fares, are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The speed train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also travel on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area are looking forward to an increase.
Two night trains are also lifted on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
Among the biggest changes are the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem must change.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electricification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end in the target station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel within two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: an increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, overall the railways will receive four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, exactly as this year. Local trains will provide the districts, overall they will pay eight billion crowns for it next year, with the state shooting at three billion.
This year, the regional trains are more expensive than 200 million Czech crowns.
For the local trains as well as the fast trains, the railway has re-established a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The rail system praises the system, perhaps because of this it has not been used to increase the price of the large majority of tickets.
Changes will only be made to CD Net once-day tickets and to eLiska on cheap Internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiska price will then depend on the driven connector, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district towns and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitante captures more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some basic students and their teachers.
This was pointed out by the Agency AFP, who originally informed only about 65 prisoners.
All 17 children arrested were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
He was kidnapped in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitantes reportedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now working on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the Agency AFP, the Millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Magindaao, the recent massacres in which 57 persons were killed were arrested.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was associated with the election to the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
Because of suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
But on Tuesday the peace negotiations with the Government of the Philippines have resumed.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been preserved by Morgan Freeman, who was said to have been visited by Mandela a few years ago.
Matt Damon won the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's film's start, critics and the public also voice reactions.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, and in 1993 he, together with the de Klerk, received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when in South Africa on the one hand preparations for the World Championships culminate, but at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against occupying the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his own words after the new film.
Of this role I have had years and prepared well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that I could receive his energy, as I say, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to remember this movie to the personality of Mandelas and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the rugby national team's dress
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people portrays the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial groups, each year and every day, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays his role in the South African National Rügbydress on the world cup field, which then won South Africa.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is considered almost sacred in South Africa, Mandela reaped large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may have been a success in bringing the people together into a single nation again, led the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only show up.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, as in recent interview for LN the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to Usti nad Labem District Fire Department spokesman Lukas Marvan, six units entered the fire.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water - foam and special wastes.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer incision.
No one was injured, the Havarie threatened according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be calculated after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one in accordance with Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened to the company of Ceps, faults of this kind are rare, supplemented it.
According to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, the fire of the traffic station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in Czech territory as sole operator of the line system, electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line track with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura filed a criminal complaint against three head of the CSDD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional rail transport in some districts.
All regions, however, have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, in which we only submitted the offer over the scope as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
So there is nothing left for us but to defend us.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the criminal prosecution to be a further continuation of the Jancura Media Show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and the reputation of my district, and I am also calling for further leaders.
I assume that it will also become clear on this issue that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional rail transport and uses lying and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and that he wants to continue after New Year.
He explained that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts agreed to operate the regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the contract in a large amount of around 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was already threatened by a member of the CSD.
The only threat was if we do not refrain from losing our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSDD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, said today Jancura to the radiojournal.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
From January onwards, vaccination against pneumococci changes the usual.
It should be the first free and voluntary family.
But already now votes report that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The Agency already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci, which were born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose.
Those who have started vaccination last year or earlier also have to pay further repetition vaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, professionals estimate that the health insurance for vaccine doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced using the so-called janota package.
Pneumococcal causes middle ear infection, but also severe infections including conjunctivitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children aged up to 10 years after examination in hospitals each year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahlas Citizen’s Association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association is already pushing for pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference where our association was involved were not very satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to achieve at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, the chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary vaccination," says Cabrochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is paid as a first vaccination by the health insurance system and not by the State.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention so that they save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians concerned with the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and then obtained by doctors on the same route as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance could "exploit the money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is an important sum.
This won't be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
American artist son involved in "Museumsthebstahl"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken with trailers at the invitation of 90 paintings in his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unannounced police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police sworn-in statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was advised by his father, "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all paintings into storage".
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta argued that he had granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had allowed an opportunity to "disperse" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponeing the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer also took the initiative to target low- and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cut-off in public pay for 2011.
Social security problems
The trade unions have protested, however, that low wage earners are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of the forthcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to some 3 billion pounds per year - has made the private sector worse, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic upturn.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
FISHING POINTS OF THE PREMA ESTABLISHMENT REPORT
Social security increases by another 0.5% from April 2011 onwards
This year, economic downturns by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax rejected for small companies
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of state pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates of the Treasury, someone with an annual income of 30,000 pounds by 90 pounds per year will be poorer and someone with 40,000 pounds per year will be about 190 pounds poorer, while a person with 10,000 pounds per year income will be 110 pounds richer.
Ministers said that their target of deficit halving by 2013 means "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be paid to 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argues that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is also necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions about future economic growth – which influences the extent of re-indebtedness and the speed of the deficit discharge – were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while debt would be £3 billion higher than anticipated in the past.
Missed opportunity
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn Labour of the "punishment crisis", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds was unsustainable over the next six years.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan, how they will repay it and press "Cynical" for difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place in June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let it pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are kept away from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which see the deficit capping coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money generated by the tax increases and spending stops is used to cover next year's expenditure, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements – like the above inflation adjustment in some invalid pensions next April – the treasurer would put off the call for a vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation is re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler budget"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only be exerted in the medium term.
The recognised Tax Investigation Institute said that the treasurer's figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain on later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, business consultant at Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-death report. Markets recognize this."
FBI investigates US citizens' arrests in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens because of the suspicion of extremist compounds in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an assault on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they were looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani, one is Egyptian, and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belonged to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had earlier been interested in the house and that no charges were filed against the arrested men.
Reuters reported that foreign minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must work with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing at the end of November by your families in Northern Virginia.
Amnesty condemns "mistakes" in Iran
According to a report by the Amnesty International Human Rights Organisation, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as it has been in the last 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticisms of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the greatest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
dozens of prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Street.
But since then there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
False Confession
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty told.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest following the election and the reaction of the government, but that Amnesty, the mandate and the power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was furnished in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into a competition pit in Bristol.
The slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the tip of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump box at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the peak of the slope, but it was also quite frightening.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that flash below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prices have been awarded for the best works done on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on minarette construction and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a sound and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared secularized societies in Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and highly argumentative study of a dispute that shared and occupied the country over a year and a half, and whose effects are still to be seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Spaces".
He is a good listener, he restores debates between teachers and students on the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or a town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it allowed for a Muslim to use a purpose-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profanous matters that he claims to be everyday life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arabic Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists surveyed by the Bowen are mostly disagreeable with their Salafi counterparts – defenders of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions to what extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, on the other hand, had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "digestion of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Disturbed Outlook of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that she marks melts at alarming speed and takes life with her that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Inspired by the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic scientists who have proved themselves to be the polar bears in hunting.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the lake, who only fought with the gunfight of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a performance.
Even today, zoo systems still typically have one millionth of the habitat of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore has become quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunting represents for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, laying down in Greenland and Canada continues, where hunters use powerful storm rifles in helicopters and motor - sledge-driving Inuit to take their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alum Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a moving insight into how the future might develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
But this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries were the first to suggest the indifference of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submersible boats measure the shifting ridges during the downing.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater basins, which are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice up to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ...the we could be"
Marine infantry were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kranze
The top free De'Angello Robinson travelled by bus for seven hours to place a single crane on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marine Infantry who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women who stepped in their footsteps.
In a few months, wherever we are returned, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to place creeks on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Peace Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (Cranes across America), which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 krans on the graves at Arlington Peace Court, in areas on the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memorial site for the United-Airlines-Flug 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation spent more than 150,000 dollars on the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband has not been buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way to give back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution, as we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Included in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers said.
The mood was happy, children played and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 krans to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends clung together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white space cards, which had been put into the damp mud, whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before the tomb of her son.
It was 8 hours drive from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infrantrie-Unterofficer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors arrested by the US government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US Office for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US representation of interests in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the charge of the "hazard".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Government-enemy graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how they and their husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tension between the communist government of the Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy places emphasis on the United States being remunerated when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are 15 dollars per month.
Since this year, the Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, they are used immediately for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to too many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, an American's arrest is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman of the US Office of Interest in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information to arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the taxing of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, which recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", an allusion to the inauguration of Raul Castro as leader of the country who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and detained within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorists looking for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had sought an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them, because one of them had agreed on the Internet video page YouTube to comment on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence department, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saivillah could not convince Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unreal mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to make the right recommendations in order to gain access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has made it a matter of urgency to accommodate human asset items within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American willow recruits are subjected by A Kaida to a special test, said analysts.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered highly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more cautious in recent years as to whom they allow access, because the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to drag someone into these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded that the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre of the City take bolder action in the field of climate protection.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more of about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened to climate negotiations supported by the UN, thousands of activists migrated with transparency through the city, where they stood in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make you aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to deal with because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reasons why I have decided to take part in the big demonstration - in order to reach the word and appeal to the world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no more way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in the event of demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be called, since he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main channel, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as light rockets, but then followed by "a few major explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent cracking air
The evidence of mathematics performance was welcome last week for the public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country's schools that produce the highest performance, the evidence shows that the four- and eight-counters in the past two years made faster progress than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures is the persistent gap between African American and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average score of the four-cylinder whites from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which their Afro-American counterparts only rose by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-counter basically remained the same, he fell by a statistically negligent point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sampling was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black four-pieces in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown over this period of time, the difference with now 58 points has hardly diminished.
Some district education supporters expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rheine and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, most of whom are white students who are already powerful children, have been advanced.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score through the treatment of those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult," said Jeff Smith, Executive Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group representing education equality in Washington D.C.
I do not jump up for a span of two or three points and down, said the Democratic Washington City Councillor, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of checkpoint numbers is that the city's secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new syllabus, the Wilson-Lese system, which is aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their peers of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that puts games in the foreground from kindergarten to the sixth class and lifelong experiences, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work towards achieving the best measures for students who are below the level of music, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rheine, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, which investigates urban test results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could lead to political repercussions that work against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, as with other city school inspectors, is of course that she tries to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we set up a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, wherever they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to shut down the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the strength to change, said Janey, who, with his teaching profession, came to an agreement last year over 185 days a year that he considered as a "milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and flashes a moment at the sight of the white pillars, brick facades and emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents have hardly finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-pieces of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the lessons per year cost 38,690 dollars, was more awe-inspiring than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student relationship of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th one that children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the intended message completely: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not quit high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college training that is necessary to get to the middle class.
In truth, one of five of the "second generation" of Hispanics concludes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workers.
Those who study powerful children often say they have a natural affinity for the school and an indwelling drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time either, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supporting network from preschool to high school.
The Federal Programme, which was financed by Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Turning a gear up - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college prep programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue to run until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil conclude contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to restore its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid drew the shorter one.
Two American companies were able to sign contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thin-seeded representatives of American oil malts at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns still highlighted by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military probably prevented American oil companies, said analysts to become more involved in Iraq, which has the third-largest proven reserves of crude oil in the world.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and who have assisted technical advice in recent years, have left empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players at two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state of China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is about to become one of the largest in the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its partners and fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
For the pre-selected companies, bids were issued, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top-planer of the Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top deployment planer of Al Kaida was killed this week, according to representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism on Friday.
This would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization in the autumn if it were confirmed.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, had been killed by a number of rockets that met on Tuesday their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of Northern Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents suspected of belonging to the militants ran into the place and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism led to undetermined evidence that Somalia was one of the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the American air raids on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Kaida's top leaders and implemented them in operations plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and maintained best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this in no way reduced the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al-Caida or Taliban leader killed since September, as in a similar attack, Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website supported by a non-profit organization, the rate of attacks by drones has decreased from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while at the same time brutally killing suspect informants.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the leading UN ambassador in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stormy term of office, which was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential elections supported by the UN.
Eide's exit takes place when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal plan, which was due to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilians to help in Afghanistan's political transition.
The army increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not give up his office, but only made an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he would like this notification to UNO-
Mr Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General, now forward so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he's better off looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has begun the search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian-based Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peace operations.
Eides' position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of prefering President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith - who was fired - "has undoubtedly caused damage to the mission, because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the US-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that UN leadership allow his successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitations of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN adjustment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not take part in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates talked to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day tour through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and took the view of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options to choose, he said in response to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is if we've learned something from Iraq in the last six years that has its own unforeseeableness."
The Obama Government is considering a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "to convince the Iranian government that it is less protected by nuclear weapons in reality", because "their people will suffer severe sanctions."
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US government joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "credible" consequences if it does not respond to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be acquired for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume discussions on the restriction of its nuclear programme and refrain from any substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has forced this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since that time – partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether or not it should commit itself to the United States.
The fact that Iran had simply left the international community with regard to some of the proposals that they had already agreed to at the beginning of October has made it clear that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has brought together in a way that it has never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those once called "pressive sanctions" by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion given in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday 'ungroundless and unconstitutional claims' by some security council members to Iran's nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers to 'make an appropriate long-term solution'.
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in the US plans from lowering the US force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concerns about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change in Courses in Growing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons they have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, due to the low birth rate and the older population in this summer suddenly began to change the course and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediately and finally: "In no case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a head of staff with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, poisoned single children, who are lovingly called "small emperors", a population crisis is rising in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
Population issues department firm, while the number of population groups aged 60 and over in 2020 is expected to increase from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1%, which is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate was among one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in the prestigious age need to be given babies to "help to reduce the ratio of older people to lessen the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial provision that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect huge fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to give up.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions carried out, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
Over the last few years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards a child's policy.
In 2004, they approved more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is an individual child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is coming for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out municipal employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outlying areas of Shanghai said that an upturn in requests from couples who want to have a second child after the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications still apply per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children anymore.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legally permitted.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wants one child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and do not really want to do this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblemished.
For middle parents with double careers, through which the birth rate drops, he said it turns out to be successful and one has to be selfish for it.
The age group of 20- to 39-year-olds today grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, places enormous demands on the parents' time.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to remodel his apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
United Nations Group on Emissions Reduction Plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference – which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations – once again focused on Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations in the near future shouldering the greatest burdens.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is due to take place next week, when more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a UN working group specifically created for it, rests on the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high should be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that political decision-makers would bear.
The process will provide great flexibility, said John Coequyt, director of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, has called "the great whole".
It shows the basic outline of a possible agreement whereby industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given an impetus to Friday's talks through its assurance to provide USD 3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts to the avoidance of deforestation.
The Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had scheduled in the last week.
The American climate expert Todd Stern has rejected formulations requiring binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign agreements without major emerging markets emerging and taking action, so star, who also complained that the text does not go far enough, could ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outside parties.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the Chinese Secretary of State He Yafei declared that there was either a lack of "reason" for the leading American climate negotiator, or it was "very irresponsible" for him to say at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
As a result of the future economic march of the great world powers at stake, there have been break lines both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is equally related to the rescue of individual economists, as well as to the rescue of the planet, where China and the United States were established because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have gone over to aggressively take action to bring the countries with very high greenhouse gas tax to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who is also working as regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding contract in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states exerts "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks had a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions had to be resolved before the arrival of the Heads of Government in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Secretary of State, escaped their planes and rushed through the paths of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to remove claims that are being negotiated during the next week.
The sheer extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go into and out every day at the convention center, guitar-playing activists stage night shows in which they make fun of the countries that in their opinion betray and sell themselves, and contract drafts are passed by hand instead of by email -- are already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 will be the leader in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Great Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h in London St. Pancras during its flash drive from Ashfort, Kent, and 93 km/h in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, Dame Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced and changing aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the streets.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning blows and fears of environmental damage could still slow down British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, according to the Times, Lord Adonis will present the report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass with a capacity of five metres to urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final line.
HS2 is also designed to create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will react to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to set off the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The drafts offer trains the possibility to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 metres of long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be operated per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that in London, a terminal station would be needed to be completed on 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be developed to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued in his opinion or not, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network has to be built in sections.
The trains would first have to change from the high-speed routes on existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the journey time between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive point of impact in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the rail, an indicative measure for the rail revolution.
Tax payers will receive a mortgage for 75,000 pounds reservation of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orangery that he was building in his house in his constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party, who was demolished by David Cameron because he complained that lower house members had to live "by lean races", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak wood factory in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The persons responsible for the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the House members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest under house members, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending control unit of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glashaus für Entertainment".
Duncan was not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to comment on the increase in his previous mortgage contracts, nor was it asked to do so in a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts.
The Committee released it last month after examining its expenditure on the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300.000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, one year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds per month as a mortgage interest by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase in the financing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros) was used.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to exercise his right to £1.250 (1,400) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post in September as opposition leader of the House of Commons after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that parliamentarians would live "by lean rations".
"In essence, working for the state means that one must live by leaner ratios and be treated as S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a small part disappearing, measured by what is in it.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The parliamentarian, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May because of his spending when it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be considered "an exaggerated demand".
As a protester in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound mark after it had become known that he had asked for 4,000 pounds for over three years (4,500 euros).
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by the Fees Office as well as the following by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about deviations and slippings or a bending of the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
Comes all their believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach cottages in Brighton have found a new content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the newest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free sparkling wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The Christmas songs so far selected are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The First Noël", where the hat decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary cleric of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturdays around the world and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have been marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which should lead to a conclusion until Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Change Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed windows with pavements and hammers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest police officers have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that, according to your opinion, 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in the east of France, in April, these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the demonstrators, has arrested the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been "without distinction", sharply criticized, and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "still held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have come with busts and trains from the big European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first appearance in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to create "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a restitution of ecological guilt in favour of the south, Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen said.
We can't go on like this and say, "We have time," said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the globalization critics has approached environmental organisations.
European MEP José Bové, the figure of the globalization critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climate justice and social justice": "Today there are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific space, where there are many islands which are particularly endangered as a result of warming, has given the start-up shot for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila there were some hundreds of people, mostly students marched in red, and bandanas, in which you praised solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (North), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denouncing that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, this happened a bit more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "Strike".
Some 131.000 people were invited to take part in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South-Oscetic region, another Georgian secessionist area that was recognised by Russia.
The polling rooms have closed GMT at 5 p.m.
Election participation was about 58% a few hours before polling, according to the electoral commissioner of Abkhazi.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Soviet-secure total occupation, has explained his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216.000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is completely occupied by Russia.
After it had been separated from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, with several thousands dying, Abkhazia would like to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to choose a venue that was in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 26,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the elections.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements that were made with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia to control the railroad for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Baba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this limit, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturdays all over the world to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Kopenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, arrested some 700 people on the verge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, who receive the delegates from 193 countries until December 18th, in search of an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers began to strike discs, a journalist of the AFP found out.
Anti-unrest police officers have immediately circled you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups that have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury during the incident, in which approximately twenty people were temporarily arrested, at the chin, by a pavement stone. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said Henrik Jakobsen, police spokesperson, while the officers' helicopters were in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or by their own vehicle from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the road to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that are sealed, there are streams that you can run through, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the globalization opponents has approached environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bové said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
In Australia about 50,000 people have gone on the streets, according to the words of the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France several hundred people joined together during the demonstrations organised by the "Netz der 350", especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the Lycés.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycés, although they are not required to be taught in the terminal (12th year of school).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have all four hours of the week and the same program", Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister "must overcome this hypocrisy", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but generally a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He stressed: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been indignant about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of the deletion of compulsory teaching in history and geography in the Terminale S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the Left and some representatives of the Right.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the S Terminals programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which, in their opinion, is the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that she was in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year undergoing a professional qualification examination and at the end of the year a qualification examination examining her teaching skills.
In addition, they perform internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued : "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours that you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "sache that does not exist in popular education."
He once again confirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card until 2012.
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the stake at the Copenhagen Summit : this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the "Ingovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first "Ernest" conference, in which experts turn to the audience every fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wanted to do something to reach the people and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fishers in the pool of the school.
"The experts selected around twenty discussion participants, even after their charisma," he explained.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core targets can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke first about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience might conclude that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online from 15 December on the school page.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the trade unions of the law enforcement officers called for a general day of action in order to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budget reasons up to January are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The second union of the law enforcement officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate and block them in front of the penitentiary on Tuesday morning, in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they have".
The third association of law enforcement officials ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite in a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night surcharges and the Sunday and holiday surcharges in December are burned as "bad and unacceptable" market.
The first union of law enforcement officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilisations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The head of the Criminal Enforcement Office and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtimes had increased sharply in 2009 and were not all provided for in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the union of the law enforcement officers guaranteeing the payment to be made next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to keep our criminal justice system operational and modernise it," said the Minister of Justice in this letter.
"I have ordered the administration of the Criminal Enforcement Office to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen because of the lack of assessment of overtime, will not be repeated in the future," Ms. Alliot-Marie added.
The December wage is therefore low, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "household constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional FO union in Marseille is indignant and announces that "all assemblies and convocations" are boycotted to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," says the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being carried out for us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," said the CGT Union of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of them less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong to note the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always distributes Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, at the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey has boasted that he will always distribute better gifts than he will get himself.
On a special program broadcast over the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend their holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo", confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she necks the president.
"So please," he conjured her and pointed to the pearl chain of the First Lady : "And who gave it to you there?"
During this one hour broadcast in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known television hostess Barack Obama had supported so vehemently during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten courses and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought with him at Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"For the first time in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was transferred to the artificial coma in order to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was once again operated on Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "damage caused by the operation of a disc attack which he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, who added that these damage had required a further operation.
The singer’s production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was “under control” and informed that a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma in order to avoid "pain and complications".
However, only after 48 hours, one had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition as he opened his eyes, adding RTL.
Upon demand of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" indicates that after its first operation in Paris, "nonerei Dränage" was placed.
The Rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a disc attack.
The surgery scheduled for several days was done by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments on RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, took the view from RTL on Thursday that his friend was just passing through a "deep valley". However, he assured that he needed "no worries" to make the rock musician, since he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was foolish to put himself in a plane twelve hours after such an operation, which didn't go that way," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer Jean-Claude Camus confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had not felt any particular concern about it.
Nevertheless, the health care of the singer had become ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, it was to the general amazement that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer op", which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer on stage had difficulty moving.
It was not until mid-November that the persons surrounding him had to dement a return to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over its favourite distance
On Thursday, the French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m locations of men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to take the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec.. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things and in this case I said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane sutures, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The combination did not pay off for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has continued with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my mission."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tombboard estimated at Zola to US$1.5 million
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at USD 1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This record is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the third century after Christ and has always been rated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysos are depicted in a sophisticated architecture decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, vice president of the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still in progress, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most for so far," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, after which she appeared piece by piece at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "Emile Zola's legacy", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the Thérèse Raquin and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to be no longer compatible after this leadership had rejected the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place during the night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement regarding the possibilities of this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft submitted by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, had returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted M. Zelaya to "thank you" and to ask him abroad for political asylum under its leadership.
However, the President-in-Office refused to do so, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, official Head of State.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by moving me to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to resign," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has frequently reported himself since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the attack of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, had declared on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putch government, to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Canal Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, would only be done as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of an exodus of M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the overthrown president, who had taken up the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and the military there had strengthened his commitment.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal nature of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the People's Questionnaire organized by him to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
His exile in Costa Rica had returned surprisingly on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be detained for high treason, where he is accused by the judiciary, says the coup government.
The coup president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninia or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upturn, the trade balance of the USA nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high on Thursday, the figures of the American trade balance show a price pick-up of the United States' shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has added 0.67 %, the Nasdaq by 0.33 %.
According to the numbers at stock market closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, the Nasdaq again dominated by technology, from 7,13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) on 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various branches, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focusses only on "half-full glasses", so it subdued.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% to 32.9 billion dollars in October compared with September.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated a defizitzuwach.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, Christopher Cornell commented on from business research Economy.com.
In return, the unemployment reports in the United States have risen out of all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new jobseekers had "falled to the low point of the year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482 % compared to 3.432 % on Tuesday evening, the profitability of the bonds to 30 years to 4.492 % on 4.408 % on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of guerrillas standing in power whistle "Damen in White" out
Some hundreds of guerrillas who stand by the Cuban power have on Thursday given up political prisoners the wives of the political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and have also waged another rally, due to which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
To the forty "Damen in Weiss", wife or close-up political prisoners, on the open road were ousted by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were at the foot of the march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!" the authorized partisans, with a raised fist, opposed the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had taken place on the eve of Havana, where neither injured nor arrested.
In Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested by civilian police in the havanna district of Vedado, who also took up the demonstration held on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, and confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police forced dissidents from the government to enter civil vehicles under violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates at the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Wise Women in Weiss" organized an unapproved march for the purpose of "Please for the release of all political prisoners", the number of whom, according to the dissident list, has about 200 persons, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders of whose husband Hector Maceda is in prison for 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 are in jail until March 2003.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "soldiers" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rarity itself is that Cuban television reported on the Thursday demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionary".
The Cuba, led by a one-party party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of compromising rights and freedoms, especially freedom of expression.
Mad man kills eighty-years with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday against late afternoon, a madman with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and five more people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from yet unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police reports, under the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was reported to be responsible for the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital for the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has preoccupied a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the Trinitarians, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were severely injured in hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of death, as he, according to police sources, was apparently affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become sick as a result of the events and is said to have been hospitalized in the "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police records, should immediately have left the road, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty-and-four-year-old, the latter of both hard.
The scenario stayed in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnivores, which he carried crossed behind his back, declared on site Arnaud Pressé, responsible for the syndicate alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passersby, including young people, should have tried to bind the madman according to the AFP’s reports.
I saw a guy in the threesomes with a green vest.
Three young people attempted to enter.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waitress of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Two city police officers, including their supervisors, have always tried to arrest the armed man and have been injured with knife stings, according to police records.
The event took place in one of the main ramparts of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passersby have come to me to inform me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in first aid position and noticed a claping wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, approximately thirty - year - old person was injured by cuts.
The police force finally arrested the man who was not carrying ID cards.
Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the District Review of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't exclude him from being delivered to a nervous institution.
According to another police source, six policemen humiliated him at the police commissioner in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "in a state of exasperation" such as "all of this kind of spiritual confusion, in which the forces set themselves free during the tattering."
USA: Polanski's lawyer asks for a new stop to prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has demanded, for a number of times on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) that the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral abuse of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has denounced serious procedural errors in the second district of California before three judges of the appeal court at the time of the hearing in 1977.
I demand punishment on the spot, M. Hummel explained before adding that the behaviour of the judge Laurence, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "was left to run down the back cold".
According to him, the judge - now deceased - had before he fell his judge's case, discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which represented a grave procedural error.
This discussion was thrown up in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and deserted" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by lawyer David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary film had "conjugated".
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the conduct of a process which would enable him to present the evidence for his argument.
On the other hand, the prosecution has repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the facts charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, even before declaring the sentence of "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't travelled to the United States since then.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
If one wants to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who is a escape option?, Mrs. Asayma asks.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and therefore disregards its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision known – even pointed out "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the arrest of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the lifting of criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any resurgence of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26th in Switzerland, on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to a house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, expecting a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and shuts down without course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without price in a market that was torn between better indicators than in the USA and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available when closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has returned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Really, the market is quite quiet," Mace found Marblehead Asset Management's view silver.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "have contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus two consecutive months and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumers' confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 as against 67.5 in the previous month, according to the Michigan University index preview.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, which means that 'the sectors facing the economic situation are being pushed down', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something to the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on the treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared with 3.482% and the bond over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World's title on Saturday will pass the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this before a billion TVs.
During this great beauty fair, held for the second time in a row in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already got their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were awarded Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true murmur of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place nine times in South Africa and is broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, at 5 p.m.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have done this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathing landscapes".
After a month of Galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and Safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and were both Bollywoodstars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to be forgotten in the bathing suit.
The performance is presented by a television host, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beautiful Queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows the world with hardly too much warmth and pride to receive, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they cost the bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains the exclamation in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Football Championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promising Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", assured his son David on Friday on his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock MEZ).
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastest" go to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on a disc attack on November 26th.
The singer was "moved this night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and to be able to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma, in which he was delivered to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a disc surgery on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo an operation again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of the sick changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event in Los Angeles's French high school school on Friday morning, in which her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP discovered.
The head of the department of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer was severely affected by the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on 26 November at the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us he had done the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely disgusted, explained Mr. Camus.
I've heard of the possible initiation of a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled far too quickly and with the permission of the Parisian surgeon to Los Angeles".
I telephoned this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I already have two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after surgery "without Drainage without Everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, who operated a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation who has been convicted several times because of failed operations and not forgotten, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Chamber, called him "a man without a scruple", who has to be "regularly" in charge of the Board of Directors and "everything other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an explanation about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, on Friday.
This explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not induce bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been practicing since the last summer, seems to be in question.
It is obvious that it is somewhat too tight for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF party alliance (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, supervised by François Bayrou's party MoDem, has responded vigorously on Friday to a takeover attempt by the seal, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin party, and called on him to use this seal on no longer document, threatening judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to accept this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he has reached the left hand.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to reflect his efforts, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC) who claimed the property of the UDF brand, as he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industriale".
However, the UDF’s association of parties, supervised by François Bayrous’ friends, broke the silence and clearly stated that they could not escape and put a deadline to the minister and the MP, in the face of legal persecution, to stop using this seal and transfer it to the trademark’s property rights.
In recent days, you have made numerous explanations that you would propose to your political movement to accept the UDF seal to + take over+, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on their political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, declared the UDF Office and asked the party NC "to remove the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website without mentioning the name of UDF".
In addition, Hervé de Charette "required that the trademark's property rights be transferred to its legal rightholders".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you to bring respect to the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends have made the "election" to leave 2007 in order to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The party Nouveau centre therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the firm continues, "when he applied for the brand name for three years now, he has been no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF to perform this for himself.
Furthermore, you give thought to the fact that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more dignified to make a name for oneself instead of trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name on which no legal claims are made."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has taken advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds in order to hide some of her property.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to answer for exploiting weaknesses in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime that will be handed with a maximum sentence of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter grapple and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in hand.
The 15th Penitentiary also commissioned a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bedtencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's Erbin and main shareholder has so far refused to undertake such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down in the investigation by Nanterre's prosecutor.
The doctors appointed on Friday are due to present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have found himself in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, the lawyer told Ms. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady that you have to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weaknesses for years in order to hide donations of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always objected to being manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to check the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the attorneys' plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
The lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt has thus called for three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was mistrusting the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Françoise has never been able to speak since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardian judge has rejected her request in recent days to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, does not stand under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the trial of the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the End of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the management of large companies in terms of its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" the best, as it was previously designed on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By focusing on the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences regularly again!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to a fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R&D, which is even more decisive, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economic = Economic Intelligence) "requires of all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach"; it claims that the employees use the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradicts.
That is why we call for an operational revolution, which would be to put employees in the middle of the company's concerns equal next to the customers.
The very benefit of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of the management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could see that in view of a new situation, the whole structure finally got along with many detours, first of all, doing what it's always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows proportional to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanistic from the major engineering schools.
Through intellectual comfort, they take over the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and unknowingly widely spread by research institutes and by the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the "Hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the executives in a position to a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a necessary operational revolution for the smooth functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol in every reflection or practice of governance: for the wage earners, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving some of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa, which allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and reposition their human resource management at the right place.
They thus create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The talk of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday evening and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who ridiculed the award to Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the President’s speech, the example of the former Vice-Presidentship candidate in the 2008 elections following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the right wing of the Republican party in the daily USA Today, and added that she herself had brought the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war to the attention of her just published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, attempted on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; one way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, was of the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, pleased the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this speech was completely historical, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The previous Member, who is considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and could not hand out a price for peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to being "cosmopolitan", as "he always does," he spoke "like an American president," when he pointed out that Europeans "live like in a safety bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the era Bush, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "long, high-travel and uninspiring".
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the withdrawal of the armed forces.
If you pack up the war under the cover of the judiciary, you can easily justify the massacre to the innocent, he warns.
The press of the moderated left remains, however, praiseworthy on the part of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, called the speech itself a speaker like him who is known for his talent as a "monumental work".
The Oslo speech "provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," says California's daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "delightful and exemplary at the same time".
Distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that will put an end to the strike order and the threatening heavy supply congestion at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was opened on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators separated early on Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
Although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. was the agreement signed.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was too afraid that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus rises from €8.72 to €9.06.
"That's not very much, but we'll start small first," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now forced to stop blocking the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the workers," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees an increase of 3% in travel costs and a maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, in particular, to address the issue of 13 months' salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the drop in employers' contributions of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 Bill of Adjusted Finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday through Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to the companies affiliated to that organisation and thereafter to cover the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association ordered a "fraud trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to disperse the Gans-Esser on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens to "shut the small and medium-sized companies in the industry over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disasters at this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris metropolitan area and the Île-de-France, continued on weekends, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration) kept the strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains running between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was ready to use only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travellers to change.
The department store-chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "it's the RATP that is trying to connect the big businesses with traffic".
The line RER A runs through the Parisian conurbation from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, for example, one of two trains was scheduled for the main time of traffic, and almost none during the low time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human commotion on the platform, as the residents of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said he had extra "stand up one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to passengers by officials and officers, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove over the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "difficult" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they ask for a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was indignant that the RATP itself put its wage proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, while this was possible for the distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a reconvening of the "overall examination of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning about 150 riders went to the establishment of a Paris Committee.
Again, it was the leader who, until now, refused any discussion during the strike, and called for a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after a pre-announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of passengers are travelling daily.
The riders of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, will receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 Euros, as well as a wage supplement of 600 to 650 Euros for shift services, as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision following the immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflict that has been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been dissolved as it has become a "place for action that is detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party’s executives, including Ahmet Türk’s chairman and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political affairs for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, which Turkish and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that parliamentarians would prefer to leave Parliament rather than meet non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "weisungen" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries to be terrorist organisations.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party declares that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court works between the government, which seeks to counter the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the Kurds' rights in order to ensure that the PKK is supported by the Kurds and to put an end to conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks had led to a conflict with the police.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the millions city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The officers used tear gas grenades and water throwers when the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurdish, Note d. editorial) on the basis of a party's ban," he explained the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are opposed to the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously look at a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced a strike three days earlier, killing seven soldiers in the north of Turkey. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow break may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Especially so that his employees can test and master the entire vehicle technology.
At the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be that far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are available to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceed according to an exact plan.
As soon as it snows wide in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 "A" routes with large-scale passenger vehicles are cancelled, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire services, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with falls, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered within a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is more likely to be held.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it snows only at 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles."
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, are the roads for delivery and development, including the Rat-Beil-Straße, on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There's gonna be some complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's foot population is on the way, danger points and transitions are cleared priority.
In most cases, the FES could not take care of all bike routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
Because it gives on this quick smooth, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatter is on the move.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1.50 meters large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle curls and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was on the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangäa.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
During the excavation they combined the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" is derived from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, most often only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but he confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these original dinosaurs is usually controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as long necks, and their relatives, and the plants milling Ornithischia (Vogelbeckensaurier), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the respiration of the birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bone, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers say that the jacks appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three lines of development were already in place early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which at that time formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangäa.
The fact is that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, Theropods.
The three cannot come from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Clearly, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted image, because in South America just a lot of primitive Dino fossils have remained, while on other continents there is hardly anything to find.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile strain to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Middle Ages, it is still puzzling.
During the trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying auras and with many more axes.
At the end of the tria, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border from the tria to the Jura died out.
Success Story Did Not Last Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack of a group of animals gave rise to flowering, which had already developed in the Trias and since then has delayed a shadow era: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of Frankfurt's Goethe University's occupied casinos suggests waves around the world.
278 Professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, join forces with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "misappreciated" the use of the police commissioned by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had let the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike clear last week because walls and artworks had been soiled.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, judge the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commission".
The room represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimisation and criminalisation of the protest" and diverts from the contents.
The Bureau withdrew from the necessary discussion.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the perpetrators did not support the damage to property, it says.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also join forces with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for their own future, says Verdi-Landesjugendret Alexander Klein.
However, Hesse's minister of science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the conduct of Uni-President and the police.
We are grateful to the Uni-President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand Vandalism, according to the CDU member of the country Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext of criminalising the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one would have cleared up.
The Left has filed an application asking the Minister for the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, is considered to be the Russian Silicon Valley.
Significant research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds had already made contacts with the Frankfurter Wissenschaftsstandort Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the companies of the Frankfurter Innovationszentrum (FIZ).
There were several visits to each other and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for which Frankfurt signed the planning department Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to meet orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the major companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received its name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
The proponents of the project are simply and simply about "the new heart of Europe".
Right so. S21 is much more than the laying down of a station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Wurttemberg state capital for a decade into a hopeless building site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head train stations with track ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which seemed like brake blocks of a modern rail traffic, as it once took a great deal of time to retrace locomotives from the back to the front.
Come on, keep going, keep going. That's how it's supposed to go.
And that's why the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway through the trans-European rail magistrate between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian metropolitan city to implement the downsizing.
Head stations, however, do not have any more entry and exit problems, since there are modern turn trains with engines and trucks at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction route to Ulm is now under way.
It has been implemented by national and local politicians.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic of the Taxpayers and not in the state group are borne by the company.
The project can still be justified to some extent in terms of urban design.
It creates new urban space, which - believe you the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with plenty of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for the passenger traffic, which is typically attributed to huge growth in the 1980s.
At that time there was not yet the competition of the low-cost pilots.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 acts indirectly on many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be banned in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
In the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the well 180 km long line through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, it has been built on the trasse in the pace of time.
It would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rheintal line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government Examining Judgment on Airport
The state government has made it clear in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will review the decision of the Hessen administrative court (VGH) to ban the night flight.
The CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to legalise the VGH ruling in more than 400 pages, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On this day, the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that in the case of the construction of the planned North West Landebahn at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to reregulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the state government foresees, should not be compatible with the legal protection of the population against night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from revising the Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig.
Head of SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises for a no-night flight ban. Otherwise, this would be to be seen as a "break of words".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in advocating the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the allegation of Schäfer-Gümbel, trying to get the state government to come to their night flights with "right-twisting and trickery".
An exact legal examination would take time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal resolution, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, his group’s statements on the night flight ban had never been.
US Banks Pay Help Back
The crisis-torn US major banks are stripping their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank's rescue fund, amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (good 30 billion euros).
And the Citigroup is also planning, according to a report by the U.S. channel CNBC, to refund the state aid.
In doing so, the institutions want to remove the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – for example, the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had obtained some 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors about changing bonds.
The rest of the sum took her out of her own checkout, which was well filled, among other things, by segment sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had increased to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup is also seeking to obtain money on the capital market for the release of its liabilities to the State.
On Thursday, the US bank could announce an approximately 20 billion dollars increase in its capital, according to CNBC.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their help.
Quick Choice
Then everything went faster than I thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced Nikolaus Brender out of office by the chief editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender, the station can present a successor.
Last night the panel wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF headquarters studio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - official to avoid prejudice to the procedure.
However, the role of ZDF-intendent Markus Schächter should also have been to prevent further damage to the ZDF-intendent Markus Schächter should not be affected by this proposal at the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s election was a hard defeat for Schachter, but one expected.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had signaled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in office.
Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief.
With the argument that under Brender had lost the ZDF's news transmissions on switch-on quotas, he rejected another term of office of the respected chief editor.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was shattered.
Last time, even 35 state jurists had intervened in the debate that deemed the action of Koch to be unconstitutional.
It's useless.
Personal@item: inlistbox
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that he worked at the South West Radio and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "now-journal".
Following stations: personal editor of the chief editor in 1988 to 1990; correspondent in Washington in 1991/92; until 1998 director and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then Head of the ZDF headquarters studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brenders, who was still elected by the Sectoral Medium Magazine as journalist of the year on Wednesday.
Koch's counterpart to the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Contract in such a way that the Chief Executive's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a delegation of party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory bodies also excluded Beck.
Brender's likely successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a wise chess train - by harshly criticizing the panel immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him without loss of face for the post of the editor-in-chief and to elect the Board of Directors, without suspecting that he would take a partyer to the office.
In party arithmetic Frey is nevertheless attributed to the left liberals.
Graduation Dispelled
Partial success for the students: After one year of the educational strike, the country's ministers finally set out on Thursday: At a meeting of the Conference of Ministers of Education and Higher Education, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
In future, students should be able to cope with their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
The student's workload should also be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural specifications for bachelor and master programmes more flexible.
There should also be no different country regimes.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Ministers of Culture and Uni-Rectors have spoken fluently about better studyability.
Now it was filled for the first time with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually completes with only one examination", says a 30-page paper that is intended to partially re-regulate the approval of courses.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden", the Accreditation Council chairperson Reinhold Grimm stated, it was intended to stop a "failure development that significantly impaired studyability."
In addition, "studyability" will be "the decisive criterion" in the future.
Modules such as content would be "tough to verify" whether "necessary interference of students in the choice of
It will be possible to avoid any event.
The students would have "an appeal to receive room for play, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules for the approval of new courses, but also for the examination of existing ones, should apply.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed.
Ten agencies of accreditation set up by the countries are responsible for this.
In October, the Ministers for Culture had called on the countries to "press" to influence the agencies in such a way that the substance content is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
Universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the national ministries on appropriate measures in individual Länder.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has committed additional funds to the further development of the Bologna process.
The aim of the money is mainly to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen student guidance and audit and foreign offices.
Land and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a novel of the University Act into the parliament.
After this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the design of studies more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
Until the end of next year, all the country's studies will be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again fought about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso College Groups called for the formation of educational policy to no longer take place "after closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, the students should now also "speak a word as a matter of concern".
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rector's Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermand: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers for Culture with whom the HRC advised on a joint reform paper.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that enabled each graduate to gain access to a further Master's degree course with a Bachelor's degree degree.
On the other hand, countries have to ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have sufficient master's places of study with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW CEO Andreas Keller.
There is a clear need for countries to employ more lecturers.
The Ministers of Culture did not, however, express their views on freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering into Germany and out of it is pretty almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which this in disruptive language theme discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
During a conference in Munich last Tuesday, for a considerable extraliterary appearance, he attended "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of her Securitatactacts".
Söllner leaves Söllner with a statement that he has been able to cooperate as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate before Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun to creep, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted the securitat's intimidation attempts."
The poet Werner Söllner is in Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that makes known the backgrounds and the lowness of a political system that is based on monitoring and focussing.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say, not only perpetrators, but also victims, as far as one can say.
In his securitate act, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner by literary scholar Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "cut him out" in all the dificient points for him at the time, says Markel.
He had a moral need to make that observation.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, however, the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate Summits, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases also knew, which clerical name was behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to the very procedurally secure sighting of the Stasi acts in this country, the handling of the backlogs of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been refuted and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler National Councils responsible for drafting the Securitate Act (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the issue of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of files.
According to the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, and an interview was held by a former Securitate Chief of Temesvar on the prizewinner.
She had a psychosis, and finally, they were only interrogated once.
The infamy of power here meant being able to express itself completely in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with hidden guilt, is linked to unavoidable questions.
Why not now? Who was harmed? The prudent response of those listening to Söllner’s confession makes it hoped that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire to know rather than by guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Satisfaction Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adrenally dressed outside service from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports product manufacturer distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the equipment, rose a quarter of an hour after midnight to a famous C-class.
The man with the striking glare was driven because of the foreign city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in play at all, and drunk before luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or go straight ahead.
In the words of Switzerland, which was first committed three days earlier: "We have achieved the eighth finale," that is, in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is due on Sunday.
Then it's important to repeat in Mainz the king-class performance in the league everyday life.
And the well revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Potrebnyak (11.1).
Exploitation
The eighth final of the Champions League (plays 16/17. + 23/24 February/ replays 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant condition of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only did the supposed healer, who in the short time had offered the uninsured Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to use and delight in playing.
I went to the players and told them to concentrate on their strengths, and stopped them to be more courageous, soul clipper Gross explained the simple-sounding concept of success, which under Therapeut Babbel had no effect any more.
He has triggered a certain magic, admitting Babbel proponent Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long break of injury, immediately advanced to the best player on the square thanks to his dynamic, tried to describe the recorded "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who is grasping and demanding discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation."
Babbel obviously lacked it.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Helt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs above all Konstanz.
Like Gross, players and managers also guarded against overrating the victory against an affluent and totally over-demanded defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening had come to mind Khedira.
And sports director Horst Helt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Helt wasn't happy about his 40th birthday even after the first home win for three months was due to the events of the weekend, which appeared freshly in the form of a television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Helt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had shown leadership weaknesses ahead of the board and had decided to change his coach to press puberty fans.
Even that his free day had been deleted after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were "skinned by pure egoism", Helt retraced and announced consequences for the finalist.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the pre-work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combative idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of the success," said Helt and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM fight in heavy weight
Hitzige Duel in Bern: Again and again, challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy-weight title after the version of the WBC.
The referee's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old champion, after version of the association WBC, defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the K.o. that everyone expected failed.
Klitschko expanded his balance sheet to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2,02-meter-sized Klitschko wanted to dictate the struggle with his left hand of leadership.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, withdrew again and again from the beatings of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the goal.
Overall, passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had taken care of some vertebrae before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "poor zombie" who "cannot do anything right".
When weighing, the champion could then be provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth Victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of absence, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered from his WBC belt, which he had previously had to give in to campflos.
This year he was defeated by Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got one blow in this fight and am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return into the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The seat belt of the WBA, however, is worn by the Brit David Haye, after he was able to detonate Nikolai Walujew, a size of 2.13 metres in November.
Haye had previously canceled a battle against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
It is said that his doctoral team is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz Falls
Frontal attack from the opposition: Head of the Green Group Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the recent findings on the air raid by Kunduz, the opposition Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor of Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The Minister had said "knowfully the untruth" to the deadly bombardment on two tank loads in September," said Jürgen Trittin, head of the Green Group, on Saturday in the ARD news program "Tagesschau".
It is called the commonplace: He has lied.
The order for killing had been issued in breach of the rules of the International Security Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of the abducted vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders in a targeted manner.
According to NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) asked Green, SPD and Left to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the German government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the German Federal Armed Forces and the Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, called on Jürgen Trittin and Green Collegin Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly refuted the criticism.
He said that the Chancellor's Office did not have any influence on the specific operations of the German Federal Armed Forces in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry's background on the dismissal of general inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the context of the two senior officers, they stated that they had even referred the Ministry of Defence to several reports, including a two-page document by the Commander-in-Chief Klein and a field fighter report.
Wichert has now asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it says.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Bundestag's Committee of Inquiry, which intends to establish itself on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see pictures in a awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it's going to go to sleep, everything's fine.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we may unhinderedly devote ourselves to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in growing up, seeing and hearing things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world are usually considered crazy or drug addicted, at least as special.
But such images and voices do not only occur in mental illness or drug abuse.
Our imagination is to blame: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality disappear.
Dream-changed guarding states can occur in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castanada, shamanic raptures, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of brain neuronal messenger substances - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is elucidated and the interaction of various brain components is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very frequently during schizophrenia.
Gravity has no more power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has been working with philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the wake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 found a "great resemblance of Irresen with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, moods of such a.
It's autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-bunt.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling of the room.
He can feel a step.
Behind him winged devillike shapes with bloodred, twisted frats, tinted fluttering.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knots them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He rises on a speaker and lays the loop around his neck.
Jumps.
The sling is loose.
It's supposed to be a lesson for you, yelling at the voices in a drum-fucking choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis; he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, the mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The Trug Images Are Cruel Reality
About one percent of the population suffer from schizophrenia at least once in their life, and in psychiatric clinics, it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected are usually no longer able to distinguish between the inner world and the outside world; they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or persecution.
Especially widespread is the listening of voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also rare.
The affected person can no longer separate matters from unimportant ones, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centric, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the General Psychiatry Hospital at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning focused on it.
At the same time it plays a passive role, it is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively make them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them, the trug images are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis is essentially preserved."
The amazing thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers are still puzzled.
Exceptions can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that minimal brain damage is present in the affected subjects.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery as the disorder of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself for many years at all.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a source of psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübecker psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether trug images are felt as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of viewpoint.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these may also include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain hallucinates healthy people.
Hallucinations, according to box, consist of memory contents that are usually held back.
They occur when the corneal cells in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or under-inhibited; if our brain is hot or even if stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this state just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it is also a matter of travel, stress, anguish of love or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents reported that they had experienced hallucinations at least once in life.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the Gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a slutty boy with long, dark hair speaks to it.
When it answers him, the students look at it surprised - no one else sees or listens to this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, sometimes she's wondering.
But she knows that this boy and the other Trug images are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are mostly frightening
Often the imagery is also a load.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new fellow student, while explaining mathematical equations for all others, both audible and visible, on the tablet.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is much too rare and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming whether the pictures she sees arise, the frogs or the girl with the bleeding cuts of arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell them about what they think is crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist's box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from a truffle, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain will then be underworked and will take care of his own conversation.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned in 13 that the man she calls Papa, since she can think, is not her father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and noises, people like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish truce and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that produce the brain, so they work so real."
Even nightly dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, psychological health is able to recognize their images of tyranny as irrational.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations also as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, imaginary experience is mostly pathological in our very conscious world," says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor of Heidelberg and Chief Physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of dream-changed guard consciousness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced person considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish in retrospect from the wake-up state.
The oneiroide state of consciousness occurs in extreme trauma or illness-related situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since the handling of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is reflected in the imagination.
An intensive form of instigation and innuendo in a situation that is inherently unbearable, which enables us humans not to deal with our own ability to design in a lack of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a salvation action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness begins to travel for days after a cardiac valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visiting foreign times and places: He experiences himself as a bedside, old man, on board a Zugsanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who make drugs out of blood.
If dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in its home country, surfs with its hospital bed in the pine snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imaginary happening, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner travels are fundamentally different for Claussen from each dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are clear to me even after years and in minor details.
More clear and intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroides, psychoses, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist box, "may lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The snow break may come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at 27 years of age
The new editor-in-chief Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We have taken care of the details.
The question as to whether they are active in the company only arises afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
One cannot imagine 7500 employees his children if they are not adequately qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the Executive Board as of January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen was appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
First of all, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, responsibility for the company's assets came up and after the retirement of Jürgen Todenhafener also the for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding company should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
Looking at the cases of fate and Schäffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "That was always about families who were infected by a capital quest that had been completely speculated and thought they could get up to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had no world dreams, says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political precedent of this country, as it was Springer, and I also don't want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping mall in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about body care.
In the wellness area, which is on the eighth floor, you will find among other respected companies, such as Hedonai, who provide a hairdress with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; hairdressers Luis & Taci, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that boasts more than 130 different tea varieties through its tea house.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your feet with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many opportunities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of devices, moreover there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, you will show various videos on how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are enough to train the body muscles.
And if you still want to look past the hairdresser salon after exercising your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for regaining the hair condition, the shine and the health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decibels
Christmas is getting closer and closer, so it's a good opportunity to copy the star's appearance and get their clothes in our wardrobe.
The form of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. You can only advise against this.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
Together with the city of Barcelona, the power company Endesa has created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements for mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the project MOVELE is being developed to promote electric cars and opinions and to summarise measures in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVEL project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement seeks to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of tranquillity".
In presenting the 2009 economic report by the government president, Zapatero recalled the measures that the government has taken to support the automotive sector in the course of the government year.
"Without the competitiveness plan of the car industry, we today had a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants," said the government president.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the success of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in line with Plan 2000E, which will be applied in cooperation with autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the exhaust gases of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, resulting in a "strong increase" in the approvals which increased "by 40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally sustainable sport
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine with the Mazda3 model, named i-stop, a device which, however, is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazda's 3 produces good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit consisting of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda has a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are different from the soberness of the German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger dream of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive more comfortably by car.
All this comes with a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is now only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It builds through its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its great comfort in power switching and its low consumption, even if Mazda especially the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called model Sportive selected for the test journey is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the standard equipment, the RVM, which eliminates the dead angle, also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-bluewood, and the chrome 17-inch rims, are the main features of the RVM.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if it were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to further elements, the learningable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not cover many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, which lies between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the tested sportive model.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest ride every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, shined more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "pee", as elegant as ever, decided to wear a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is also limited to a device with which you can only read your emails without being able to see certain attachments or browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when Time magazine chose one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is nevertheless especially for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has brought two new devices to the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to be able to read their emails as soon as you cross the border or if you desperately seek a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrates is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers are already offering special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but according to my experience, you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission of affordable roaming tariffs for all of Europe was almost always ignored.
Out of the country you are always afraid to read his e-mails and that with right.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs means that telephone providers need to slowly, but safely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, its prices include downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
Without wire and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, that is when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase opportunity with life-long Internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even when Barack Obama was President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him in his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: more that it was almost the same color - a shiny greenish yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she wore a little large embroidered or necklace.
It goes even so far that at first sight it appeared that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different from the fabric they are made from.
At the inauguration she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo of a patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-high heels and for the second time an obscene model, but gold colours.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: The hair was raised on this occasion as a hair wreath, while the hair was previously exposed.
75% of working mothers have had problems in work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want children.
This is the result of the study on fertility and career of women in Spain conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of women in employment see their career opportunities restricted on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of occupation they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other activity outside the house, work only half-day or do not have a fixed employment contract, become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women are shifting with a firm position, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and maternity, and therefore have fewer children.
"The women of the age group aged between 35 and 49 with a fixed employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the contraction, a number which increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have achieved their contraction and the first child only much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major influence on maternity, albeit less than the calendar of readiness to receive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor which must be taken into account at the age of women at the marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference was also observed for women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have primary or higher education, were on average mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women get married with a primary degree before their first tenure and get their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree are just different and are first looking for a permanent position and getting married and then getting their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his widely envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising statement "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous banner like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (co-collegiate of the cast of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the UK fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) the three-way X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear - inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks an amenity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on horrors or enlightenments.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "In reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhappy fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband has been united by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, the same in whose flesh the emotions of adultery are united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to come into heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8,000 peaks in the worldwide literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, where again and again the best climbers try again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a comical mess.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a county landowner and again other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad cry, which was shouted from a bridge by that person from Munich, so that his echo fell down to the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He made this on a journey, on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence in front of the worms called the afterworld.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt herself and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses engraved by Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the harbor,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life you find delight in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on them between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not only known where the man put up with so much patience and fell in love with a neurotologist whose literary talent was still much deeper than their madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, that he might put himself on this podium?"
Fiery Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood last week in Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 came next to her and our dog, our dog is a mix that we took out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then from a warmer sky they missed him two footsteps and severely injured him with it.
Our disarmament cannot be put into words at all, as it is incomprehensible to us, since the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was naturally carried out on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation which a woman who went to walk comfortably came to justice because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will perhaps also do the same with a woman, a child, an older master or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a usually quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have sent a message at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether that will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the very beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowards were Spaniards.
Our disarmament over the event has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for the animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, particularly in younger motorcyclists, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "covers far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure with each day" and further confirmed that it also contributes to a step closer to this goal every day with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will be distributed in a first phase posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "an ongoing concern" of the company, and precisely because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles it is always committed to one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again
After almost two years the car market for small hauliers finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008 and, much more importantly, they are the first ever to grow after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac and Ganvam association.
However, these good figures can currently only be used with great caution, since the reference data used for the comparison are November 2008, which was a particularly poor marketing year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total allowances for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all vehicles made up of the small transport market: passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vans and lighter small-cars/cars.
Furthermore, the same clouds of thunder are still in the sky, which are most affected by demand, as even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
In this way, it is necessary to include other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continued poor economic situation, in relation to these restrictions, which are the result of the credit institutions' inflows.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a 2000E vehicle has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to buy a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Yesterday, Ganvam had recalled that it was essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Car Retail Association predicted a similar year for 2010 as the one just past, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road cars) of 19%.
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the anti-lock braking system ABS at the time and as is the case with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergency situations must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already required for all newly authorised passenger cars and light small carriers, for the remaining vehicles a standstill period was set until the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union aim to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuvre, which detects the system by means of the brake strength applied by the driver to the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to hit the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the brake distance that a car is passing during the braking process.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year.
There would be even less accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (via radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system helps him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already unavoidable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes to minimise the damage in this way.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel to January
While the employees of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on April 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the page concerned already gives its prior consent to each point of the plan.
And for this reason it may be that the final document will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works until the beginning of 2010.
However, it is assured by GM that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American car builders to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has back coverage from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger acceptance.
Should none of these buyers come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the tax of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos easier, bringing only 1,275 kilos to the scales.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to refrain from the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a flat panel with manual drive, so that alone they saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3, another 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; moreover, they reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing the sporty Bacquet seats even 12 and saving five with the light 19-inch rims again.
Then, due to the omission of the CDR-30 audio system, one had once again reached six kilos less and by replacing the door handles by handles made of fabric, the missing kilo was reached.
Although it is also available with the double coupling transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmissions, mainly on the smaller coasts of California, on mountain tracks that really went very curved.
In his driving behavior you can only give him the note perfectly.
However, the reduction in its weight has by no means led to the fact that it would no longer be on the road as safe.
It is more the opposite of the case: for a long time, we have not been testing such a small and lightweight model, which gives a feeling of great safety at curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the necessary time until we give him the orders to rush, slow down, recover and then bring everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he's told him. The car does everything we can with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has succeeded and one can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used at the Panamera for the first time.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginable brutal, regardless of whether standing out or speeding up again.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the highways on which we drove with the boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the blowholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track; and this, although we found in some of these curves ice in the morning gray and roll split in the morning.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultralight car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it otherwise probably is more rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Behind Girl.
The singer, a bustling friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and is thus the first place in his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triple the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue reds, which started at the top of the ad board from the beginning.
As the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play Barac inside and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter was already thought that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game had not been decided for a long time and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that on their playing field not everyone wins, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of Elijah" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "golds" turning the row (50-49).
More Disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a couple of matches with safety to get air again and one of them suddenly came to Mirza Teletovic's pistol, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that on the display board there was again a turning distance from (54-67) that the host could embellish with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesen were blossomed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team did not and tried to give up their team again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitter was put out because of Fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, well defended themselves and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injury prevented Unicaya from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in group B of the Euroliga to him, and that in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to begin dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts faded with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of it's Unicaja, although the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show that the scoreboards in the 13th minute 22-20 showed their favor, the minute in which, due to an action it had come almost to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm at last and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-made errors of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up hunt was impossible
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, who proved superior despite his 19 losses and even managed to balance the difference of the Málaga game with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn brought the lead within the group into swing.
Unicaja tried to get rid of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaya, thanks to the leadership of Cook and the triple use of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57 in the 31st minute.
Nevertheless, it was impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to brake.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic succeeded in the 37th minute to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and the tour had to take place at Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile in Facebook?
The users of Facebook can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most displays of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, experience their salary that they should earn due to their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users are provided with a form in Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Even after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker on average feels "badly paid," explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman of 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with EUR 11,592 per year net; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14,725 and that of a worker with EUR 15,667.
The most sought-after posts on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date of departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office of the Council must leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that he had to leave the message he had found since September 21st.
"He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27th, as his mandate will expire on that day and he will have to look for a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," said Zelaya on the phone.
After the elections on November 29th (when Porfirio Lobo emerged as a winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to obtain refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, in the refusal of Zelayas to recognise the status of an asylum seeker politician who wanted to force the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate for the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to leave the liquidity indirectly free of interest, which is moving around zero, so that banks buy assets for billing.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have as well as been terminated and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to scatter some sand into the transmission system, as the BCE almost had already done with its annual auction that takes place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we will just be witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in the corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to take private risks and sovereign debt rose again.
It is now set back on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the Eurozone and Germany.
Spain was still barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down regarding Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is not detrimental to silence the defenders of the moral risk who had again tried to raise awareness among world economic policy leaders of what they had caused, since they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting loans to the loss of jobs, when they should have decided to take a new day of thank-you action.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was also foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals the debt of the state, elections and a new government that pulls on the same string.
Prodi made it to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal in Italy to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to stop fulfilling its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to include its citizens in the need for extraordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some dissipation on too high amounts, would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish were to continue to increase, this would be a special risk for Spain.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above mentioned indicators force a large proportion of market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their 2011 scenario up, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this promises no long life despite warnings.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "Be careful when driving".
Connected branches
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply was debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance on which the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán gave the press some clues about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, subject to the assumption that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the condition of other "support energy" of course.
Galán, who believes that the draft statute for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is on a line with what his company has called for, did not in any case want to say anything against this law, such as incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "there is a clear long-term focus on this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as she called the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, Mr Galán believes that decisions on investment should be made already now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for groundhandling services at Swiss airports is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for baggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, is scheduled for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, of which 50 % will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for his first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration would like to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and the toll office administration.
Expecting the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), while in the last phase three consortia, mainly made up of European construction companies, compete with each other.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues group, is against the team of Acciona.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrowest section, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which is also part of ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises massive construction work and privatisation, however, has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a local construction company that has access to it.
A strategy followed by the above-mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only by its 30 % stake in high depth, the owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of Assets
Acciona places the highest importance on this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already well known as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry because of its activity.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the building and infrastructure branches.
The subterranean toll section, which will be funded by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (North-Züber), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass road (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure of congestion on Brisbane's streets.
The schedule issued by the City Administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex venting system.
The Government of Queensland participates in the financing of 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
Brisbane is already a big business for high-deep.
Australia's high-level contracts, signed yesterday with the government amounting to 154 million, have repeatedly given rise to considerable contracts.
The ACP sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables by means of its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will enable 400,000 people to access the Internet quickly and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of King George Towers with 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work has not yet begun and a high depth has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, Manchester, too, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the surcharge for the construction work for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
Construction is scheduled to begin at the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will be over 32 months.
Sri. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has committed advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sri. Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sri. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, which presented the competition issued by Renfe, of which 4 came to the final round, among them TBWA, which had been responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sri. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom because of the slowdown of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of over 63 million euros for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to France.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in landline and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and fidelity programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly company and still state company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 because of the handicap of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority which is waiting for the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and has therefore returned to a relapse.
Retail trade services of pharmaceutical products
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade site on the Internet to increase revenue from non-phone transactions.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has contributed 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since the beginning.
The Champions League has developed itself since its birth in 1992 as a source of revenue for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to EUR 5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) participating in this event since its founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one who has won the trophy three times in addition to the AC Milan.
The leading Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took the most money through their participation in the last Champois League.
And that, although they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that have been able to raise money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing process used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA foresees 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the pre-qualification (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for participation gained 3.8 million due to their flowering presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800.000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth finals receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter finals, 3.3 million each.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who earns 5.2 million.
So a football club gets at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed revenue.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments for which 337,8 million are planned.
This money is distributed proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday passed on details of the sale offer of shares with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which, due to the number of shares, does not force them to make a public tender (opa).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which is paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed with EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa considers the company to be 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jerez gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At a closing date, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
When trying to stay on the verge of possible offers of purchases and the judicial battles of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book exam.
A decision that makes her the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created post directly under the leadership of the group.
This is anything other than free from polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle for suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar's credit, former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paterina’s public tender for exclusion submitted by Mer Investment Company
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public procurement for Federico Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer last 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been proved that the conditions of the law-enforcement legislation are complied with and can therefore be considered as "sufficient" according to the amendments of the last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at acquiring 550,0008 shares from Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the capital of the company, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only the motor vehicle workshops deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles that have been involved in an accident are dragged into workshops where an assessor has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No accident is the same and the calculation of the costs for the parts and hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100 % of the experts use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process it afterwards and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reports are produced using their products.
The other two companies competing on the tool market for assessing and drawing up a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data the manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the volume of data to be processed is becoming increasingly large, up to the point that even more versions, variants and motorizations have been on the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the company starts work.
It is a laborious task, for each of the aber thousand vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which to "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure is speedy.
If this is a less common car, it may take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain for complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-traffic vehicle fleet, it is over 99%.
For the execution of documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialised in certain brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
More than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
With the transparency of the products that Audatex offers, one can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, while the star of the AudaPlus products is a standard solution for dealing with accidents for the assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid according to purpose, i.e. for each opinion.
It is most expensive for customers who rarely use it at most ten times a month, i.e. 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt alone using the chassis number.
AudaGlass is busy with the car windows, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the specialist market on the Internet that can be provided for vehicles that have been declared a total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses, or providing information on the deviations by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be found in the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a particular period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt Estimates, which is also intended for reviewers, providing similar types of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Eina group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions to assess the damage, breakdown or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT expert is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3.100 assessors and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and sales amounted to 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of their business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this respect, the company has revenue of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today their shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Sale of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59,5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase next year to the remaining 15%.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and added value, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively for professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrapping sites and car dealers, who must be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added every day on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis numbers have been declared may no longer drive on the streets, but certain parts which have not been damaged may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars of historical value may be re-authorised even if they have been de-registered after difficult authorities.
Estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps:identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small vehicles and 44 trucks.
Of course you need to use a computer with Internet connection.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a chart of the respective model appears and after that the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts, and thereafter he can print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for assessing such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 Euro per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automechanists have been waiting for for a long time, as you can, for example, choose a door and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
