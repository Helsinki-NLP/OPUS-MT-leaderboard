The Prime Minister of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko since his first important foreign visit in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for closer nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it, as it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before he turned off to the bush country, where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accused a 20-year-old man of failing to observe a stop signal as well as careless driving.
He is to appear in Karratha before the Court of Justice on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing from the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, asleep, and could not signal any consent."
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for the hearing on 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put in place a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"Just as trade unions die, so do middle class jobs," said Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
I am therefore proud to present, together with the citizens' rights icon John Lewis, the Staff Authorization Act.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as on other forms of discrimination - and thus stops workers employed on the job.
The addition of the national labour law to create a possibility for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to sue a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation for damages or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of her bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that the trade unions have been subjected to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and uphold labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocratie Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would make sure Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements which restrict this right or aim to diminish it are null and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the Presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
As this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then be protected in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - should then be included in collective bargaining.
After these rights in America came under fire, it is in fact very wise to reintroduce the American ideal, which means that the working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and has raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - are long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Richter stops the law on time that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force them to close
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was introduced into the law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana in June, and is due to enter into force on 1st Sept., would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient's right of admission at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles in order to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while endeavouring to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing will be held for the judge in order to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abduction advocates welcomed the decision to take the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors needed more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are exempt from a sacrosanct law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five hospitals in the state to uphold the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and had also applied for the right of registration.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that had forced most of the hospitals in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Advocacy advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Adversaries of abortion object to the fact that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of hospital closure.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has a patient-intentional access rights, informed the Center for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patients' rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put an online video home for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians in which egg stock cancer was detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing diseases, and the social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those with advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers than possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologenes, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to combat distances, it proposed, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of refugees doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more closely at their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study revealed a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of egg yolk cancer.
Garden centres regret falling house owners' numbers
The decline, together with an increase in the number of house owners under 35 years of age, could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "Kernaltersgruppe für Gartenprodukten" after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent by people with private homes for their garden.
The increase of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of paving forts for parking purposes and the declining garden size are additional factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion per year are put into sale.
In Greater London, where over a period of 6 years the share of homeowners fell from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is mentioned.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot move plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the retail trade due to increasing domestic numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather in the March and April last year, following unfriendly weather conditions.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators hit the state TV station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that the protesters could have pushed the protesters back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but in the meantime it sends again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with poles and stones equipped with collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but this one refuses.
The country's army therefore urges a political solution to the conflict "to waste no time and apply without violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan is urging Prime Minister Sharif to have cheated on the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey ordered US diplomat for espionage reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country's oldest U.S. diplomats to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the U.S. ambassador and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, that also had the most important intelligence service in Germany's Ankara, caused much worse reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Lokführer threatens with consequences for commuters
The Federal Warning Strike of the Lokführer on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The delay announced at 18 to 21 o'clock is for all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Photo: A. Burgi/Archive
said the district chairman of the trade union Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to anticipate the consequences in concrete terms.
Chief of Police of Magaluf charged with corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by policemen and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of Mallorca's prosecutor.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested in the notorious Binge-Drinking Hotspot Magaluf after corruption accusations by businessmen and barbers.
Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the City of Calvià to the Office of the Prosecutor for the Prevention of Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the corruption charges and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
National Spanish daily ABC reported that the indignant nightclub owners said that the vetting of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our basis of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a trip to Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the orderly behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic-drinked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while the Playhouse and the Kneiptour organizer Carnage had to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73.000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents involving alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from a balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already sung at night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a guss that started just before 20 o'clock and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided for an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday at a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The buoyant weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At that time, the wind was about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start even on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40.
The delay resulted in a delay in some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthias says: Maximum time to network
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech hubs, our columnist Bernd Matthias comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone falls, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind this: if the cable were not, in the shortest time all the listeners would fly around in the house without a trace, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, the ekeltronic (ekeltronic) applies.
No, typing error: electronic) Sector the rule that the world news of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And who, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, simply says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the Andängen of the Ifa at the radio tower this week is once again showing us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who once ruled washing machine and CD player blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread in front of him with unfathomably poor expert speech: "Connected Home, wearables, health care and urban technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you all right?
What should we talk about with people who seem to voluntarily spread such quark?
In fact, for some 20 years now, it has been primarily a matter of connecting our house with each other.
In order for the yoghurt to reorder itself so that the fire alarmer informs us on holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office from the air conditioning to our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true in the near future: We lift our watch, say aloud, "Saws!" - and at home the dust-saugrobot leaves.
Irre.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are fading," realizes an industry knower, one can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but what does not help, because we are standing in the reservoir.
From daily practice we also know: If a new-mode device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in shelters, while rocket and mortar fires were on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools were closed in Gaza, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought to the communities in southern Israel a feeling of joy and expectation, drawn by rocket holes, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, were removed from the walls and sliding walls before the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, resident of the kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said that it feels "a bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and to escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, in which a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is difficult to draw from Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the ports of the air and sea in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the surrender of the corpses of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue fighting, the education authorities moved last week to the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of the votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl spoke out in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the current prohibition proceedings against the NPD were to end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts off worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU country manager in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a gratifying development in the right direction and a development that is more likely to lead me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not in front of the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD had just failed at the five-percent hearing.
A first attempt to ban the extreme right party was failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection had also been in the NPD tip of informants at that time.
In December 2013, the Bundesrat submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
Refugees are now accommodated in tents at the Neuländer Square.
The primary reception for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all the seams.
Now the Home Office has set up three next to the Red Cross tents.
The district politicians were informed only a short time before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further provide citizens with reservations and do not allow district politicians to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group President of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party claims that the district administration of Harburg currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for overfilling in the first reading are the incitement of those seeking assistance - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data of Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
RP Data's figures show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while Melbourne rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
On the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices increased by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued to say that with the beginning of spring there would now be an increase in the real estate for sale, which would be subject to "a real test".
"If you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the CEO of Peer Medau and attests to posing "like a field gentleman".
The style of the university was not this, says the communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already "been informed orally about the instigation of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans became known only in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "proposals or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The extension of the narrow road to the castle necessary for the entrance was also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
It was a street nine meters wide, and it's not the talk.
According to the current stand it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The Medau operators' argument that their free and schooly parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future does not mean that Pötzl will not apply.
Zugeparkt is not at all because, as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking About the Residents
The Kinderkripe Bergwichtel, which is located on the premises and before which door would lead the entrance to the park deck, is said to "not be affected", according to the President of the University.
Rather, he says, "that this is not only about the children, but also about the residents at the entrance to the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it's a lot more than the special interests of the gentlemen of Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the critique of the parental council of the children's critique, by expanding the street would be entitled to "the few natural spots of Coburg be lost" "can be decided by the reader himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bauamt of Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Last week, Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's scripts about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access for the new park deck is not supposed to go over the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but over the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be expanded to approximately one kilometer in two lengths.
According to invoices of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus ten times.
Of about 2000 vehicles per day is the speech.
On the part of the city, they did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf retires from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will not play for the DHB team anymore.
The 31-year-old of the Federal Ligaist SG Flensburg-Handewitt raised health problems for this decision.
I don't like the decision, it's matured over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He is therefore in international retirement with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go on Toreiagd for a few more years for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, he is no longer available to the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Islander, who announces his cadre for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me just as much as they will inspire my long-standing fellow players and my successors.
But for my club, I would like to be in good health in the next few years, for which longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which do not allow the current double load.
In 2012, the left-hand man had even had to fear his career ending after a heel infection.
Due to Achillessen's problems, he had been treated by team doctors from the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency procedure followed and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, which ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career don't pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health facilities that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations, which took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
To this end, some other wear-related complaints arise.
At the beginning of the year I noticed that I can control my head, but I can't deceive my body," said Glandorf in an interview with the magazine "Handball Time".
He'd only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the tricks rip, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time father explained to the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years I can play handball.
I also have to say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012, I also became quite humble as to my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a little straight.
In 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) he won the EHF Cup.
In 2012, he won the Cup with Flensburg.
German economy decreased by 0.2 per cent in the spring
The crises surrounding the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was notified by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
The consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while the investments decreased.
Foreign trade also slowed down the recession.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, GDP rose by 0.8 per cent for the first half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "feetmen".
The Netherlands' largest cycling association, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through Münsterland with their application.
This tour was offered in various professional journals.
We come from Den Helder and we drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland once more in this way," the cyclists enjoyed the route through the districts Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.

Katharina went on a little "peace journey" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Furthermore, the route, which had been prescribed for three different categories, led to Men's Wood over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres in height, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres in height and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres in height, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were taken on the way in Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
Chief organiser Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion to this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on August 30th or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin alarmingly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, brought to 287 pages in "Monch and Warrior".
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thought facts, the Municher born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by an appropriate song text.
And he is very honest about this: from masturbation as a gymnast to shoplifting and drug consumption, he does not let out any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide spaces also take in abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also, as he has not only influenced the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought Lebemann Konstantin Wecker to the ascetic monk, who is "made by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary away".
Between all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, over fights in a local, or a crazy car ride, which he originally assigned to a tree.
He's very honest, too.
Lenny Henry: My father never put me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother died, and Henry is thoughtful of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only stopped his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A big part of my life he was this serious guy in the corner that read the paper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than those of his father, he did gain an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's now a little lighter, but they're dark, rusty, deep, ugly labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of red.
My father used to just lie in the tub and then one could hear him slowly as he started to sing, because he could wash the foundry from himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ expressions of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was in bad shape towards the end of her life did we begin to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with that "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
It contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's strenuous.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been held by the theater.
It followed the comedy of the errors, and then the Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the Sitcoms and comedies who have filled out their busy working life.
He started at only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for a rather long time."
He learned in the profession.
I not only had to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black," Henry performed his comedy there for five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But for many years this "priced light pillar of British television" was also a "Great Parody of Black People."
By introducing figures that ridiculed British black culture as well as celebrated, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chief!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it feels like everything feels like you're just taking the time or kicking a little."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought him mainly for a middle class domain, whites in pantyhose and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very scared of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't hurt yourself if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right on.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me "You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem had been solved.
I left the stage and something inside me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This also came well, so it's like a large shield of gods who tell me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a Comedian - our conversation has gone through with humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitates persons.
I have decided not to make stand-up comedy because I find this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're going to drive with it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I want to, but overall there is not as much as before.
I wonder if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up that again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital city of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central roads on Monday in Sanaa, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Parliament's approach has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi-Führer Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the newspaper, Huthi threatened with another escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthiss fight for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has besieged the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody struggles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registered officials to contain "spirit staff"
Kenya has started registering all state officials biometrically to remove "ghost employees" from government salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people receive salary payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his inauguration in 2013.
In an early review this year, it was found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month of payments for "ghost employees" and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government assumes that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been notified in a government message.
All those who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list, the communication went on.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the salary list at both levels of government - so the "spirit staff" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal of the art consultant Helge Achenbach was first negotiated in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht 19.4 million euros.
This was announced by a judge on Monday.
According to the complaint, Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and oldtimers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission would have been higher.
Achenbach had purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children Need Roots and Wings
Forty-four years he was in the school service, 23 of whom was a headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many standing Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his striving to see the people in the student.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Richter was born in Trautenau/Nordböhmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
After four years of high school, he was already interested in the teaching profession.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were evicted.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in Güterswaggon.
So it went to the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers to the next station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the entire city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping place in a red cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951, after three years, he took the second State degree in 1954.
As he had no free teaching position, he moved to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "Dienstwohnung" in the school house.
In 1958 he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year, these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a retreat at the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to acquire today's building from September 1982, which was expanded after Richter's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional work space built on community costs and during the expansion of 1997 cellar rooms, although this was not eligible for school building guidelines.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered.
In all his career Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a report by a school council on justice and justice: "You should never forget love." Manfred Richter did what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know, "It doesn't always work." Whether he thinks only his students or just his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's action was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils were beaten up, they did not get a criminal job and were not blackmailed to the afterseater either.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had ordered two pair of boxing gloves and had the two contra-gents attack each other, even if there was to be a feather.
For the benefit of the school, judges as Rector maintained a good relationship with former Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-partisan judge after his retirement to run at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, judges were elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bikers enter the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten intermediate stops
When cycling on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten rest, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday alone, however, the number of relaxing impressions was: The 700 participants of the hr4-radtour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open air in the Schotten Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and attended a concert by Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had been started on a bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the manager of the own-owned Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the landwives from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, teaspoon, sprinkle and cheese cakes, which wonderfully painted the mature cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake landwives," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
At the drink stand of the Geiß-Nidda tournament club cold refreshments could be created.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and sought enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a massage of heads from his partner: "He earned it, after all, he has fixed already abandoned bicycle chains again."
At the same time, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of Reporter Rainer Janke's Trinkukhaus and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Professor Tobias Hagen, who has been in charge of the tour since the first hr4-radtour in 2004, was also able to unravel for a short time, but he had plenty of time to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three phones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squad of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants is based on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
From the resort the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after one and a half hours: "Shock!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists in the idyllic Alteburg Park were required.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had preserved a beautiful ambience and, of course, they had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather sweaters.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as Executive Board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporty activity on the bike, the opportunity for swinging in the open air was used zealously.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens who were just as concerned about the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police didn't make any immediate comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal association and picked up telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) described her conduct as part of the activities of the Islamist clergy fethulla gullen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Patikhow, headmaster of the Slavjansk School, who visited Jazenjuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their further lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud procession from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombatier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Executive Board of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the head office of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their settlement was said to be nearly £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former BP Chairman, when she sought more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet consultant.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest, if things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol, which requires a full-scale reform.
But which new incoming chairman would risk starting to attack everything and disintegrate an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps bringing himself around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status surpassed.
While competition is getting closer and threatening new technologies of old, comfortable security, the ongoing negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is associated with special hazards.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year, the British public certainly buys into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is on the popularity scale again up: 53 percent today support them, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news lines on my mobile today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that reducing tweet was not authorized
On Sunday, a tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, contained a disparaging remark about the democratic District Attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for the abuse of official force.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account that lost the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve the tweet and have deleted it," said the later message.
Perry's employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former tweet was drawn an unfavorable image of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced in April 2013 for drunkenness at the tax.
Perry filed a veto against financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an accusation against Perry - who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The tweet's text reads: "I don't always go drunk with the triple alcohol level ... but when I do, I'm going to sue Governor Perry when he plows it."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His high-ranking team of lawyers applied to the judge in charge of the case to reject the charges and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the state - which is based in Travis County and is determined in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing his fifth election at the Iowa elections during his presidential candidateship in 2012, Perry began to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley again explains the housing market for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction companies pointed out that the housing market in South-East England had returned to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly sought and the subject of huge price increases, which led the Bank of England to set upper limits on mortgage credit due to widespread fear of a credit bubble in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the top-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Catastrophe Office, prices in the city area alone rose by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about a fifth in the past year and by £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "currency tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which tighter credit allocation arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth both in real estate sales and in prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its prediction for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on already weakening house price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now decreased by a quarter year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amount due for future sales amounts to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best sites remained stable and as a result, future sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes by the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
Annual tax earnings rose by 40 percent annually to £280 million, sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that revenues for Berkeley were expected to meet current market expectations.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in the afternoon in London trade.
Photos of Jennifer Lawrence released by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar Award.
Naked photos of Oscar Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Master List" of pictures of another 100 Starlets.
A star's representative from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and complained to the hacker for "eclatant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the Photo-Sharing page 4chan were allegedly created by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "Master List" of the Hacking Victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Cate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our home - I hope you are so happy with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues that it is in the photos about her pictures and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are GIFT, people.
Let's just turn our backs on it.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande renounces the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letters "J".
They were shattered, so one could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that one has left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distanced and perhaps a little scratch-brushed.
Then shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was ridiculous, as in hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this infirmity was a just beginning affair, which had been far more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more distant and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who thought Kevern had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, in the baths were still spiders, naked snails had left their marks on all windows and believed that they belonged to all that, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, which looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a childhood fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had spent an unusually warm spring afternoon sitting with Ailinn hanging on the broken loungers in the high grass and enjoying an unusually warm afternoon. Both of them had been clinging to the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-lost black entertainer, whom his father had gladly listened to at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their original aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not Forbidden - Nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully oversolated, as is the oversolating of the word.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations had never done, and how people at books chose the Vom-Tellerwasher-to-Millionary Memoirs, Cooking Books and Love Romanes, so they chose the ballads at the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing big feet in a grob-comic Serenade Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without laying two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played even if he was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only space for a single "when" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be quite sure where it would end.
Just as the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed in mind.
Although he had become 10 years old, without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Once again, no laws or constraints.
A conformed society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks swept plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as if THE WHITE WATER WATER, IF IT WAS GREEN, was out of fear of being accused of burning, for fear even that the flames would devour them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha pipes restaurants, kept in mind and became depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words that Keven had just told her could ever be wasted.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sounding of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Chever's view.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her uncomplained raspberry hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're going to sing it to me.
She seemed honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked at it again.
Your feet are not that direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the soothing charm you needed to take care of the horror inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and raised himself out of her deck chair, threw the console around and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement they seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I'm being pulled to you perversely," she said...
Except I'm not at all.
She saddened him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here like there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more dismaying after them, when they had been their ancestors as smugglers and robbers of the beach, moved from Kneip to Kneip, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she hadn't been careful!
They first knut - Knuts was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the nothing-saying love ballads from the console - they first knut and then beat.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the bullying itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He raised himself out of the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt faded, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him see how he was distant - just as her companion saw him from a room on the upper floor - a man who was complaining about something that he had sworn up himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, shamed, defeated, without a spirit of combat - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just reported, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public opinion, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, would have been most expected, in the light of the money and energy that had been invested in the extermination of this violence.
"A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggression of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness was historically rarely felt despite the high-demanding church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be indelible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population is crying when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicating itself with stories of overcome difficulties and claiming to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the former rawness hold the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and perpetuated struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nut Tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nutsbaum answered.
Are you a lesbian?
Again Esme appealed to her right to privacy and to refuse the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a job that's free of charge.
We serve a free-of-charge society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, may occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "hidden" and "raw", could as well be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If one continues to wander around on what HAPPINESS IS, WHO IS HAPPENING, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking its essential life force to the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED lettering in flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen to you, agree, apologize.
Speak is better than silence, the sung word is better than that written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out on," Esme Nussbaum answered with a calm voice when she was sure that her supervisor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we haven't been healed as effectively as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may be able to find out how we repeated the mistakes that were made in the first place in the past.
This time, however, it is not the other time that we let go of our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to demonstrate English patience.
"They go too far," he said, "if you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you talk about them leaving out their "wrath" and their "confidence" on "others".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as when protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From who, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was bad or well done, what happened has happened.
It was then.
Nothing has to be said for this anymore - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be attributed, no debt has to be absolved if such a recovery would be appropriate and if there would be a way to blot them out.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget them.
If there's anything I can say about this...
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcyclist who, as described by passersby, had been on his foot in a sort of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho disputed to have a coup planned for the overthrow of the government and said that they were against police officers accused of being armed by political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded its seat and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after he had reported threats of attacks.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup, but that the military reacted to the threat posed by "political fanatics", whose weapons were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defenses acted after he had received several intelligence reports that inside the police were acting on some elements that actually wanted to armed some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were just standing before to cause devastating damage," he said to the Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action made the impression of a collapse.
"Even if no one claims to have robbed the government of itself by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Speaker of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating into their barracks and the location in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Mothetjoya Metsing, the vice-president, takes over the leadership during Thabanes absence.
Thabane said that he believed that he had become the target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there has been great tension since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the conflicts in his unitary government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, despite otherwise pronouncing charges.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, with a carefully observed study.
The final market purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced break-in at a time of increasing tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be recorded before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a reluctance of the euro area and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week on whether he is considering a quantitative simplification for the euro area, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, leading business scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worry child, as is the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer taking place are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline of industry is likely to exacerbate the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping manager index of production in the Eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow afterwards."
He added: "Currently, producers in the euro area are finding life quite difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase uncertainty in the difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said that it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell-tenth of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the horror in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy engulfed West and East in abhorrence, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the horror in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will forever persecute them.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now haunts Ukraine - and in the children like them die - will now end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back into the smashed school sports hall
She was photographed by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she only tried to climb back into the smashed school gym after a mine was exploded.
Aida looked for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn't," said Aida back then.
My legs were blood-soaked.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knees.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said fluently.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmates Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory becomes somewhat weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Great Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and contribute to that not happening again.
The boy who fled through the hail, in the belief that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russen goes to school at 7 years of age) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a weeping toddler, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who shut his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality Tamara had collapsed outside and suffered leg injuries in the hospital, on the other hand assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded News of the World newspaper) to obtain the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to fade in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I was playing with in the yard and who didn't make it out there.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open-ended car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding myself.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the school academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly recalls her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood at that time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her herself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting she and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember Damir wanting to eat Borscht and calling all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant, so he shot his water gun on her and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and are still killed.
These are just like our children.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
With it grown up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered under it - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, turned his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he kept throwing all his weapons and other military toys. So now 17 is bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, unlike that of many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of Beslan's abomination after the siege
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the Beslan barbarians.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she ran off to take her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was an entire family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer this date moves, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that day when Georgy wanted to go to school, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgy in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at our house in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today, "It's important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Humans constantly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does this happen?
Ten years are nothing of such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when September 1st gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friend.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I don't pity myself.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and visited a medical college in Wladikawkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was imprisoned at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was imprisoned during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret agent, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is excruciating and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's secret service academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted to.
I sent my documents, including the medical personnel, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and should not suffer it, of course.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse if the anniversary draws closer.
I'm going to go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgy won't go.
It has to be even more intense for him because he was there and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he was returned to me.
It's in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if you're into something so unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated several times, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say he overcame the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only adds to my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the slain.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can almost not believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how could it be that we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab and throw these rebels out - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was carried so severely by a special deployment command
Saved: Alyona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian Special Forces (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not recall the horrors at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Alyona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from Beslan's siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty held their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous mess.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana that he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of crossing girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man stands in court on a pedestrian crossing in Fife because of the overrun of a three-year-old girl.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge states that Mr. Steward had controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruth, contests the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are worth about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders feature scene and recording modes that optimise exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, Action Cams usually don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you're doing a lot of footage.
If your camera has a row mode with which a number of photos with slightly changed exposure settings are made, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to put more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is very important if you are working with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects when they are intended to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the illness and the pain of the treatment.
Among his patients, as his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and diseases are important to the doctors, while the patients are mainly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting caught up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he blamed his wife Juliet impatiently.
"I'd rather do everything right now than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and worried for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, that is, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
But Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre material, which was once considered "wonderful" but has now been recognized as lethal.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type was no longer used in Great Britain since the 1960s, when industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where he was still in use, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumber, construction workers, room workers and shipyards, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he hardly seems to be worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the climax of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths of Mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of Mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types have been banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the hostages of the Mesotheliom are not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no refuge.
Parliamentary buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been designated as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "in the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are still gonna get sick?
Andrew Lawson diagnosed mesothelioma at the age of 48 years.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still sick?"
The UK’s leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic is expected to occur in Great Britain, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the documents of the courts to which the victims often turn for damages claims shows how far the hostages of the Mesotheliom have already spread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, but it is still considered by the EU and the WHO to be "high health risk" with possible death outcomes.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amozite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolith).
The UK was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that "there is clear, but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
A staff member of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, in which it is shown that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliome was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment without known suspension by work or at home."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes behind the parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be engulfed by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of this House are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work has to be done over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than at the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective regulations."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never precisely determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you have worked and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and was doing surgery late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had shudder rust.
It came quite suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains from the chest, the skin around his lungs touched.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprising doctors took X-rays of his chest and put Pleuracathether on to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports and violent breathing.
In 2011, a patient found abortions with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast coat.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year this week: "They told me it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the material.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have turned their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And so innocent objects in our houses, such as floorboards or sliding roofs, have by default contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in much of our properties," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a woman had entered was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how to tear off your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to absorb all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor "How long have I got?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly hideous because it is our life-saving mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled and the fibers are inhaled, they can become trapped in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital that Andrew Lawson assumes it has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well in Mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasure denies this.
"You can't cut out the breast coat," he says.
They don't come around with the knife about it.
Thus, the cancer speaks "not very well on chemotherapy," which shows "effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and consulting office for those affected.
"Hello, cancer center," he was happy to introduce himself on calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and his life was expected to extend for only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "let things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be forwarded, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the consent of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail inevitably, many affected by another financial concern are about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what has changed in the 1960s was that one realized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligentness of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually joined in, but it wasn't what Morgan called "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma patients who are trying to compensate, to assign deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom people to claim compensation, even if their former employers were no longer to be found.
The law has established a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone who has been diagnosed after July 2012 to prove contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court would have been able to address them in a normal damages trial - about £120,000.
Around 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma victims that £350 million was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time had not gone over it and that Mesotheliom patients found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in view of seven deaths daily, rapid action was necessary.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December of last year.
At that time Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Long-Lazdunski to present survival rates of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is seen again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
When you give up, you're going to be much worse.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans did not show any signs of disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-threatening.
Sustained six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that would not make me old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very cozy and unspoiled.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesothelionotic sufferers, such conversations are not filled with hope, not with a trace of hope of survival.
The disease (just as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a fierce security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong's right to government elections, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is probably blazing the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led to planning and mobilisation within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the National People's Congress's Permanent Committee, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong government elections would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants elect the government chair from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership firmly maintains the process through a closely controlled nomination committee controlled by Beijing.
After a new clause, only candidates should be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to fire the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general electoral right.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers announced that the movement "has considered the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort, an action that should take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security measures, including police and barricades, were tightened in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
Intrusion of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
Furthermore, fear is growing that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement, as they endanger the business operation - the life vein of Hong Kong.
"The protests they're talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to frustrate that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China have also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
Tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the region's history in July.
The U.S. school completion balls tradition is now transferred to the universities where freshmen performances are offered by private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK's first luxurious travel service to students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive presence at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to pass through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that the students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A corporate spokesperson said that no new bookings have been made since the service had just been introduced, however, added that "Students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that, despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as being abolished.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month see themselves facing a crisis of living costs, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the rising invoices for the simplest basics of life, before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student's home.
Feminists criticize racial and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
While the tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women revolved around the race to 100%.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays came with titles such as "thanks to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism not only revolves around the suppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism many people are found talking about the whites and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to light that black Americans are exposed every day, but are not regarded as "women's topics" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colorful in their own country are under siege, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were laid, and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They decided to stand for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When one remembers such things, one becomes aware of with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with since generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" asked Mitchell.
Second generation feminists, who built their careers in the struggle for reproduction rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, asking for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will bring about changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which race and gender themes are addressed, some of her comments on the racial theme in America are rather astonishing.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks to Ferguson contrast with her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently put on a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police surveyed nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, the topic of immigration reform is also on the surface again - this time as a women's topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a rethink of the topic as an essential women's topic they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reindeer in the women's organizations," she said.
"Schweine-Haus" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included an image of the living room of the house - which was also part of a pig that his head had slept on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo was, however, erroneously published and was now removed," said one company spokesperson.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
Domestic sales in the social media were of interest when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto Winning
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth will continue with a lucky winner who will get almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot in the drawing of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profits provided a topic of conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city doesn't talk about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought such a gain might come.
Eight WA winners celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a satisfactory conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had only a few weeks before won the mega win of $7.5 million.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that winning allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas Bathing in the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators were in a groovy position at the first Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were thrilled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial force of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator's owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men into the ring in succession to a heroic two battle in different gladiator's casts.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangle sign and short-sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short-sword and wormflake as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, which attacked the "Secutor" with litter nets, dreizack and dagger, and after a short battle shot the lads to the ground.
Since the swords were metallic in strength to each other, the shields created and the strangled plants flew surrend through the arena, that fear and fear could be caused by the health of the gladiators.
However, the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an ever-aware eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman era more alive," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greeting, became part of the amusement park for one day.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains were also to be admired during the Roman day, such as "Aquedukt marble" from the eleven-metre-high Roman canal bridge, which was once located at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once faced the water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the day."
This is also confirmed by graduate survey engineer Ralph Heilier from the "IngenieurteamTwo" from Rheinbach, who presented measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints that were left in clay by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011 the Landesverband Rheinbach office for ground monument maintenance had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord business park in Rheinbach.
They have found cover walls of an economic building with a dart for drying cereals and for grinding.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained to archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A series of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, according to Morscheiser.
In addition, the children were dealing with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal grips on wax boards like once the Roman students.
At the stand of the Romans Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glass mosaics basting and at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim a heavy wheat mill made of stone to make the flour for a flat bread or a muesli.
With the original Roman coach drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors drove through the leisure park and also passed the impressive stand of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a week of Romans from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also bring itself to the 2014 Roman Year, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem are offered, among other things, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes and the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told of his work on the nearby Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a ludicrous lesson is presented in matters of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule devotes itself to the Roman theme during a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often no longer visible at first sight, are to be restored.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall a small presentation will be reminiscent of the discovery of the Berkumer Matron sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Burdens West Africa’s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go a long way.
The devastating Ebola epidemic causes a severe blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are wasted - the virus has severely added to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
On the market comes only who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit the hardest by the virus, and the fever alone has killed more than 600 people.
Recently, health authorities stated that the disease occurred at every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
All in all, more than 1,500 people died, thousands of others joined.
Foreign companies attract employees
Companies operate throughout the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the regions concerned.
The local merchants and farmers also respond: Few merchants leave their hometowns in order to buy a posterity.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the cocoa and coffee beans important for export are rotten in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert for the West Africa economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic foods such as rice is fading.
At the same time, the region that is heavily dependent on international companies is at risk of image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest risk is that international companies basically avoid the area over a long period of time, says Philippe Hugo from French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors could get the impression that "living in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia is dangerous and therefore also investing in it" warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the tight government budgets of the States
The disease also affects the already narrowed state budgets of the countries concerned.
Moody's credit rating agency fears that their budgets are severely reduced by the high expenditure on the health system and by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already detectable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people already stay at home for fear of a contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also clearly declining.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th foundation festival from September 12 to 14.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year foundation festival run from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 6 p.m., there's a big ball shoot.
The evening of the evening is followed by the "Stoepfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blskapelle provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Festive Service and 9.30 p.m. in the parish church and the great ceremony at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon the price distribution of the Federal and Gausching is also available.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their Dirndlins.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage took over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment by exercising in room-use and small-caliber shooting".
The NS regime had led to the dissolution of the club in 1937.
Only 19 young men were found again in 1964, who on 30 April at the Gasthaus Lukas took the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau out of Baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult initial time, in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting company.
In the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the guest house "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st of Gauliga.
The club records were displayed every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active guards has increased, so have the membership numbers.
After the club's "Leininger" location no longer satisfied the demands of a modern Schützenverein, the then board of directors, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After work of 2,700 hours on May 8, 1988, parish priest Strasser granted the church blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th gaussy, coupled with the solemn consecration of the new coat of arms in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a "Böllergruppe" was established.
Josef Schmalzl was mentioned by Böller.
A major challenge for the "Böllers" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller meeting 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members last year modernised the rooms and the shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof and thus brought them to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting services of the Schützenverein can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann entered the district league 1 in the 2013/14 round of the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauliga Nord to Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as Bockstechen, Fachings- und Königsball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
With it, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffered an accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race route ended halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart had to have the right side of his car repaired after a collision with Kyle Busch before the race on Sunday evening.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston and added: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tugs and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart ran three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his place of work during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that the investigations on the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart has to expect an accusation.
The three-time champion was welcomed with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at the 12th position, Stewart was in the first 10 events shortly afterwards and lay on place four.
After a reboot in round 122, bush fell
Cars with no. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars heading against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to 21th place.
Quest for Danceful Young People
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to participating.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn are also making full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now more young is sought for a sport that is healthy and is great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more activities, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can enter the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, on Thursdays between 17 and 18 o'clock or Fridays between 17 and 18.30 o'clock in the dance sports room.
"Training starts regularly with a heating program," says the trainer.
After that, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classics, sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, socialism is not too short.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance movies, and we've already stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Who doesn't like jazz dance, can even sneak into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always join the classes in the children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop classes on Wednesday.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who likes Discofox, Slow Walzer, Viennese Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango may come by and join in.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of jailers from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia capital.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with the Minister of Interim Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours for one month and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the prison union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian national ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations took place, the Director-General for the Implementation of Punishment, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union association of the employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army has given up Luhansk Airport
In the East Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tanks were allegedly also involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, gave up Luhansk Airport.
At the same time, the army reported that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had already drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme leadership, without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot off the plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters in their own representation.
In addition, around 100 soldiers had been injured or killed in battles in the region of Donetsk, the insurgents reported Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard ships submerged
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Asowsian Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been shot on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, and a spokesman in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they have controlled several towns in the Donetsk area.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the Separatists from Eastern Ukraine should participate.
In advance, all stakeholders used their appearances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the Ukraine crisis due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a crooked breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
Russian documents and statements show "that they consider us to be opponents".
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he would like to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readines Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations were started for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union will be awaited if it will also send a representative to discuss it.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe draws around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Power word: Toll will come "all clear"
Now the chancellor is clearly confessing.
A free letter for all complicated details, however, is not.
The CSU's persistent concerns from the CDU against the car tolls have seemed to frustrate the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll after persistent opposition from her CDU.
"To make it quite clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party manager on Monday after meetings of the CDU summits in Berlin.
Merkel, however, did not lay down a detailed model for the time being.
In the black and red government program, "certain parameters" were called.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a "proposal and it is now being further worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also constructive in discussing a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he spoke with Dobrindt about further opportunities to invest more private capital in infrastructure, for example in broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to compensate highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the federal minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Lashet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never expected to mutilate all district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU President.
In that sense, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverbanden Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that tolls affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition fidelity because of the toll criticism of the CDU.
The Left considers that the plans in view of the dispute in the Union have failed.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Montag).
"The Minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a mandatory level on all German roads to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be taxed in addition under the Coalition Treaty.
Therefore, they are to be fully compensated for tolls over car taxes.
The model must not, however, be detrimental to foreign drivers because of their nationality under EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One Briton says that she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disturbances such as muscle weakness, an unsafe passage and curved toes.
Sickness also suffers from feelings of deafness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was gonna sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children today who is 51 years old said, "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and everything lasted longer.
I could never ride with the other children roller skateboard or skateboard and was often in school to walk and walk because of my kind.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she found her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25 and then slowly lose all my skills.
I finished all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair."
I think you have a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former task force
For almost ten years, the former training ground in Münsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, every month deadly ammo appears in the heart of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb.
The pomegranates are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be sprayed on the spot.
A deafening bang hears from the explosions about the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen Force Training Square, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares of area is the core part of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb, which is open on 13 marked paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington is rising with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the Washington companies were no exception.
Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $21.6 billion to government and local agencies in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent last year, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of falling notices 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, is from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenues from companies at 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years at growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to be true for the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid $10 billion in government and local real estate taxes together last year, compared with $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing public and local tax revenue, as real estate taxes amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, much of the property, especially in the D.C. tax area, is either owned by the government or non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore obliged, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenue by enterprises cannot be attributed only to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland included $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise evenly in all three locations.
The increase in the district represented 4.3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
At 6% in all three branches, Virginia has the least corporate income taxes (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district it is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a better overall tax climate exists than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9 percent to 6 percent this year, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the government continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state by 2017 to 3 percent.
In the meantime, small businesses in Washington seem to be better off, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than the corporate tax total.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes will probably continue throughout the country this year, with an increase in general government and local government multi-military tax revenue by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the Federal Government's spending reduction affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China is now looking for a brewery and is also hoping for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent request of the Officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle down in our city," said the Deputy Party Secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the operative of the ruling Communist Party of China returned to this concern of the Twelve-Million Metropole in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also called Canton in Germany, was one of China's richest cities, and was named Li.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessische SPD President Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be listening to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer, it doesn't take much: good water, grain and vitality," he added at lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines out to Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the officer from Guangzhou came up with a sheep gümbel - but with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German standard of purity.
More business
A second request of the Chinese host would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it had been cancelled for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," was the politician convinced.
"Trafficking between our two cities is on the rise".
Travelers would currently have to take the detour across Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of the Guangdong Province, the capital of Guangzhou, is also hoping for the airline.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German connoisseur, nodded.
Maintained Partnership
The ludicrous vice-president of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been transported out of office because of corruption charges.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the officials of Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, enforced by Head of Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before joining Guangzhou, he worked as a senior function officer in Fujian, where the Autobauer VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km away Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong with its economic power as the entire Hessen.
Next year, she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
Joan Rivers family "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since her delivery to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter was hoping today that her 81-year-old comedian recovers from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We all push our thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered to the Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under careful observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "harvest".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Dust cleaners and wages that are environmentally friendly
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are now traded.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, the pollutant class "Euro 6" applies sharper nitrogen oxide values.
There is also more money for the scaffolding builders: they receive a national minimum wage of 10,25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.44 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information on Monday morning had reported: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a takeover from Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked as if Twitch's sale to Google's video service was decided for a cool billion things, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravours in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser give the (mostly older) games an outline of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken up a bit bored, a textbook example of a established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about, as the company reported that it was willing to pay as much as Amazon did.
All we know about at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer sports to watch as they do, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others while playing instead of taking control console in their own hands.
It's one thing to look a friend over the shoulder at 3:00 a.m., while dragging by Resident Evil, and something quite different, to see a spinner in his head as he's shot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast passageways in which Roger Bannisters perform our entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humor virtuoso, his twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called up by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is difficult to imagine Twitch being integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to do: thousands of young men who are converted as advertising customers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of the gaming," and the medium shows no sign of shrinkage, not even - sluck - as spectator sport.
At Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday evening a lot was gone.
The organisers' concept was in line.
Despite the strong rainforest on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the Burggarten.
Time had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt puddle l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
For the open air in the Salzweder Burggarten should shine brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already evident on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors opened up to open air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they have succeeded in doing so.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese it had made Salzweder, but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings cozy.
They followed the first live performances, wheezed with the foot at the clock, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were sought after.
And that's across the generations.
While the one on ceilings on the extra-carried-on white sand was lurking at the beach bar, others were walking on a quarter of the wine in the vinothek, the youngster was dwelling on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the children's makeup, the volunteers had in the truest sense of the word to do all their hands to become lord of the craving and to enchant imaginative creations in the little faces.
The sizes used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the goodfoot crew made of salt vedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 he chatted down on the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dryness.
But the attraction of the feast did not end this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why there is nothing against a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the popular voice.
As irritating, he said that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security firm had been booked with too little effort.
The result: some who had already paid were no longer on the premises.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzweder co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were intriguing in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The salt weatherer Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox broke off their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than a success from the numbers of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes, which will be delayed the first time, but have to be removed in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers must include criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you've just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it's very good that some not only fools, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now the organizers will be one year in which to reject these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchtower landmark shrinks
This is not expected to happen.
Rather, the ready-to-lay component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
The size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case is put on.
If the weather is involved, the action is scheduled to go over stage at the beginning of this week.
A participant at the Ice Bucket Challenge narrows Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went down painfully.
A woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she ransacked her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom was swirling so much as her ice cold water was poured over her head that injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't work out, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this, too, and laughed almost in the pants, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to allow the jaw to narrow down again after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgvereins soon pull back on a string?
Finally, there were always quarrels between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the leaders are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
To date, the views of Wolfratshauser Burg's history and possible reconstruction seem to vary considerably.
The two camps now move on to each other: talks about a common approach should soon be held.
This is confirmed by the association councils Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we be able to sit together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could in future pull back on a string.
This is how it can be seen to be a success faster.
While the Burgfreunde had an eye on the rebuilding of the castle on the mountain forest, the castle association around Sjöberg has the "development and development" of the site at its forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was delighted to hear his own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been standing before the Burgfreunde.
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September in a member assembly.
At the moment, according to the 74-year-old, the club has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially let the association activities rest from respect." This "think phase" was necessary to "think how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make a current impression within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to run because he has his place of residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The tölzer would like to cooperate with the project "but very much.
The different points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl's eyes in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the rebuilding of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high level of participation of the population as well as through voluntary helpers from around the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time, I have come to believe that it makes sense to drive the project forward." A "single setting" feature for the Flußerstadt could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of rebuilding overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein might be moving a little at this point.
Their goal to first document the story is "important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever Ways to Save With Uni-Teaching Books
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students amounts to more than $1,000 a year, the Fast-Twice student Matt Schroeder considered a clever savings.
He invented a loan system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick File-A biscuits," said Schroeder, 19 visiting the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books he needed for the last semester cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that the student spends more than $1,200 a year on the average for textbooks and study materials, but that there were different cost mitigation options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university books, reported that renting textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college books last spring's semester, said Neebo's vice president Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores in campus books.
Here's the one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price they have in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't make any of the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was resold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them to some extent well, remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Learn about the terms of the transaction in which you are renting, including the penalty charges that may apply to writing notes, underscores or signs of use.
Looking after tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
Chegg allows you to rent Calculus for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be attending Pepperdine Law School in the near future, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, so Gault says that the book is actually in stock.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Has Not Been a Cash Beater
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored to Cameron Diaz, recorded only 14.6 million dollars at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Drachnammen easy made 2" also disappointed the revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the children's films may lack quality in the films themselves.
In 2014, Collin described as "the worst year" for children's films so far and described "drag teeth made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
In the case of films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film launch, which was shown on at least 2000 canvass between the American Memorial Day and July 20th 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and movie critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times change."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved sales of streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, with sales of 837 million dollars.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for concentrating too much on cartoons of comics, and fortifying a "nuclear melt" of Hollywood.
In view of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could contain a true core.
Due to the potential cash beats expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema case at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted to streamline the league division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the programme.
The result: Those who have not ascended have descended.
For example, Göttingen's highest class team, Torpedo in the Oberliga delegation, has avoided the descent, but only plays in the coming season.
Four-class torpedo ladies remain, despite their magnificent march through the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserves enter the new Association League, in which the Landesliga no more Göttinger Klubs are represented.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Association League, the Torpedo-Second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new District Soberliga South.
Here, TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Boender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC are joining.
In the District League, as regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende are playing in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The women's district soberliga starts at least in Sollstärge.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are listed in the District League.
With each nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the District League squadron of the SCW boys - there starts still Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with every nine teams.
In the West Staffel are the Red-White II, Bovenger SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the East Staffel.
The Dame Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemellen, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no women's teams on a circular level.
Remarkably, none of the six 2nd-circuit classes achieves solstice strength, here the innovative and resilient circuit board will have to think.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to form an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-tip.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments for us on the weekend and talked to demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenager out of the Blue Mountains
Two young bush hikers were brought to safety with the rope winch after they had been caught over the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search group from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had injured her knee and the man was devastated and had opened his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were vacated on Monday morning.
They were supplied in stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Anti-Government Protests Escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter resumed the radiation after about half an hour.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial team.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the head of government, whom they advocate for election fraud.
The police reported that approximately one kilometer away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there had come again on Monday to clashes of around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
A police officer was injured after hospital reports.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "to waste no time and apply without violence".
It also stated in the communication: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has fueled concern for military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
Protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan suggests that Sharif should have won the parliamentary elections last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is supposed to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in place to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had been peaceful in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to come to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second victory in the season on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday has taken a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team with the Out in the Europe League had reached an intermediate depth on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important", confirmed Captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who was ahead of three with green-white.
With the second victory of the season, Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success experience to the break of the national game.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley of the Sixteenereck in the 14th minute, set the course on victory.
"I thought I'd get all the frustration out of Thursday and beat him under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship match in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm out of the rapid growth," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term blizzard, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing there very well.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this mirror wrong position.
He earned the gate, he's already done some assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour which finally made the decision.
Because the guests could have been able to write about that.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," Schrammel also remarked, who thus pointed to the break-up of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results have not been right, but the player was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that one had "been better than today in many games" - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium".
The first three-points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure was the setback to spite of intact: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him not less pleased: "That we have finally played too zero again".
A lot of work during national play breaks Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger there are several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their launch debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," said Barisic, who over the past three days lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately".
The national game break must therefore be used to "sleak wounds and add a bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 electives in his ranks.
One that is probably particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself apart for the team, going over pain.
He has shown that he is a very important player for us, especially in this difficult phase," Barisic noted.
Hofmann not only gave the structure to the Rapids game before his dislocation in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We've probably had some luck too, but eventually luck has to come back to us too.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He said of course, "You can't always see this in black and white.
We haven't played so bad in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But neither can we believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role to the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to do with himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-matcher "of the category Spellertor", as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly known by Arbitrary Colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that in some phases we were not concrete enough.
We have had too few conclusions.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It started just as badly, but then we found pure and even made a gate.
By and large, it would have been more in there.
Under this whip, Ruh reigns.
We showed a powerful tribe during our lecture of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still present in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Gißruheiche" above underweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes through clusters, basalt stone piles and basalt stone lakes.
A little under the quarry from Bauersberg, a mile north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of the area and resembles an American mammoth tree with an extent of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bishopsheim Archive extraly and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what kind of concern it has with the gißruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, up to about 80 years ago, the goat’s herds should have driven their animals from underwhite brown to the roughly rooted meadows freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers who were exhausted from the ascent should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, for goats are actually grazing on the meadows.
The area has also been declared the core area of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has found out further.
But when you enter the stone collections, you should be careful, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to stay for crossbreeders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweitenbrunn to the tree, which is a little hidden.
Further paths are signposted, the direction of Hochrhön rises and invites you to an extensive hike.
Where's the water castle?
A water castle, which is sought at our next task, is, however, rather rare to find at the height.
The mirroring in the trench is already a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the district that could fit the building entrance.
Where's our "Stück von Rhöner Glück"?

After a week of dewing, Italy's Prime Minister and EU President Matteo Renzi, took over the appointment of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit, and she will be succeeded by British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government’s close daily La Repubblica reflects his appeal to Mogherini as a favourite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of social democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to keep the left-wing basis against him calm, for Mogherini is assigned to him - albeit in a moderate way.
In contrast to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President of the Council, Donald Tusk, said the prevailing opinion in Rome to produce a political balance.
The EU's chief diplomat will also be the Vice-President of the Commission, Juncker.
The still outstanding approval of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that for almost two decades the leading party offices have proved their worth and that Mogherini, known for her ambition, has been showing itself to be "enormous challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began the PhD in 1996 in the Youth Organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008 into today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the election of 2001 in the Party Council of Left Democrats, she entered the High Party Policy, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose Head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy participates in a military quota, liaising with the social democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's over 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini, as noted in PD-Kreisen, has a share in it.
The provisions in Brussels, which the new EU representative had too little diplomatic experience, so if there is no substance, are to be answered in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly from Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and defused as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, to be transported directly to southern Europe through the Russian natural gas around Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi entered office as EU President in July, Mogherini went to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the Shake hands were taken with indignation in Brussels, as well as that they invited the Kremlin Chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new staff are active in four training occupations: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Büchsel from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidt, Johannes Beer from Neunburg from Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberweichtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Tanner from Pfremd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday the trainees of all years as well as the trainers will go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where there is a whole-day walk and rafting on the Inn program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet conversion has run counter to the great majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said with great applause.
As a daunting gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a relaxation of the rules of Emmanuel Macron's new business ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had strongly called on his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered sand into the guise, in which she acted at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "believe in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant struggle of the Socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valles government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls does not have any, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's reputation after a dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that preferred elections would be a winner and ready for government.
The governing party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and the right-wing national front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of the Dutch period of 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and the record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion needs to feel fast that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, according to industry experts, has advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customerele, while there is competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also has a 20 percent share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company in Miami, Norwegian Cruise, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and in the coming years is expected for it due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice for cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to approval authorities, 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent share in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises Exchange, have over 82 percent of passenger capacity on American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A Pekingtreite group waved nearby the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be associated with Beijing faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and has led pro-democracy activists to realise their threat and to paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that the calls for democracy will extend to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper setting out China's predominance on Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, marching hundreds of thousands into the city's business district and organizing a sit-in.
Lis survey is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macaus Office of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the course of the day.
Student activists announced to gather in the afternoon in front of the head office in Hong Kong.
Until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not foresee any democratic elements.
Putin asks Kiev to enter into "state relations" with the East Ukrainians
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government take up the fight against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately engage in negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region.
His spokesperson Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of East Ukraine under the control of the Separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to open negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy it has apparently followed since the beginning of the riots five months ago: aid for the separatists in the taking of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija to effectively independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary gleam of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on October 26th and during government groups, attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope to be "encouraged in their illusions", reported Itar-Tass.
"We must immediately engage in detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state of South-East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months now, in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker on the correction of Putin's "fail interpretation" underlined Russia's leadership claim to deal with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period resulted in a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would empower the regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russia's territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that make important components for the Russian military.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukraine's legislation - after new elections - be based on constitutional additions, allowing the respective territories to have a greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded the East Ukraine through the previously peaceful region along the Asowian Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the hands of Ukraine's security officials, who, according to fears, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have been started to secure Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just in front of a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which would enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers joined the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first Ukrainian soldiers, probably included by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australian promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn't make any noise for his trouble over hackers who probably naked pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who is who stole the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film town is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal about promis on the Internet.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos from Lawrence, star from "The Tribute of Panem" and from Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly also took private photos due to an iCloud gap.
The list includes 101 promis.
The nobles who had engaged to Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
According to reports from a news website, Grecko, at the time in New York, said that the hack was "bad" and that the affected felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies upstairs without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "It's a horrible violation of privacy."
actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but selling Hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the spreading of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, jogger and hikers were present yesterday at the 8th wheel on the Großen Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-sick children".
The tour, which was for one torturing, represented a light training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus has been riding the bike on the Feldberg yesterday.
For good purpose.
The small muscle cat can easily get away from it, since the participation on the 8th wheel on the Großen Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - fine!"
Little Pleasure on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
As Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants were tormented yesterday in the early days to the mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to cross the well-eleven kilometers long line between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician who appeared in red from the day of the circle - red dress, red bike - did something on understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is the target!"), but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without breathlessness.
He also went through the route in a slide, as well as Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson of the city of Oberursel, who had made his way along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "Here it is about Charity, because we like to be there - we would have made an exit anyway today," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to strumm back to the height immediately thereafter.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun was also "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk bike tours over the Feldberg are just included.
He had turned for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer tells himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He must be, too, because he was on the road with the "Fixie-Rad", which are racing bikes, but without switching...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord, proved that even without a wheel, it was easy to go up.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said: "I know them" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleigh trail, only that he pulls the sleigh himself." So the man is to some extent his own sleigh dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to groups on the track in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers took off.
Bent Hansen, president of the club "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start command and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
