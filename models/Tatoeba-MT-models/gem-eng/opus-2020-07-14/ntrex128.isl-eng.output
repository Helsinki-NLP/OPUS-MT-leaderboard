Many stewards are concerned that “he looks like a fool”
Some councillors propose to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Congress).
Concerns have arisen as a result of a plan to change the name of the council to the council.
The stewards of all classes are worried that they might be ridiculed.
One employee member said that his group was worried that “it is more like Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers who live outside Wales: in welfare, twp means stupid, and pwp means defilement.
A member of the Board of Directors of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and made other suggestions.
A member of the wealthy maintenance team said that his class had ‘open mind’ about the change in name, but pointed out that there was no significant difference between the word MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context, it can be said that the whistling w is performed in the same way as in Icelandic.
The council, which now works as a legal board to present the name changes, said: “The final decision on all the names of the members of the council will, of course, lie with the members themselves. ”
The Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Belgian Council the power to change its name.
In June the Council published the results of public opinion polls, which showed great support for calling the council a “good assembly. ”
With regard to the staff’s title, the WMP (Welsh Parliament member, well-elected senators) was elected, while MWP had the greatest support in public opinion polling.
According to news reports, other suggestions are now being made by the council officials, but it may be difficult to reach agreement with the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is to submit a bill for the changes within a few weeks.
The reform initiative will also include other changes in the way the council works, including the rules on the removal of the council members and the organization of the committee system.
Government officials will be able to pay a final vote for their title when the bill is discussed.
Macedonians vote in elections for a change of name on the land
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to Northern Macedonia.
This case was voted on in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with the neighboring Greece, whose country is named Macedonia.
The City of Athens has long claimed that its neighbours’ name in the north is equivalent to the requirement on its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for EU and NATO membership.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not view the elections as valid.
However, the voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the change in name is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Church clocks St. Martin's sounds are difficult for churches in Harlem
“ The older people I’ve talked to said that before, there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street, ” said Adams.
"There is no finding there today."
He said that it is understandable that the weight of the skin should be reduced.
“People have other ways of meeting ” to this day, he said.
"Bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood where people gather regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will return to the place of origin. ”
He added that possibly churches were replaced by homes full of people who would not help to save the neighbor’s remaining places of refuge.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, ” he said, “and will therefore speed up the permanent closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who move in these buildings will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s church in the decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
The congregation of black people who had worked nearby took over the building.
The Society of Dark Ones took over St. Martin’s Church under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to shun shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who yearned to recruit black workers or give them status increases.
The building was seriously damaged by fire in 1939, but members of the congregation of Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it and also had them build the clock.
Father David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson, proudly called the clock play “the clock of the poor people. ”
The expert who played on the clock game in July called it a different name: “Human Resources ” and“ a unique historical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also said that this was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved over to a bigger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not received anyone else in his place.
In the past few months, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Academy.
The Church Council, which oversees the visit and is appointed church leaders, wrote the Episcopal Church in July and expressed its concern that the Episcopal Order “would seek to bring the cost to the ” Council, even though it had not been involved in the council of the architects and the architects who sent the Episcopal Order.
Some members complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the Episcopal Church.
Shark hurts a 13-year-old boy who dived for temper in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving for a hump in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near the beach of Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rushing over with a group of others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was only a thrill to have had a temper, but then “it became clear to him that the boy cried out, ‘ I was bitten! ’
I was bitten!"
All his bones were torn up," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water! ’ ” added Hammel.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
The captain of the beach guard, Larry Giles, said at a media meeting that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a more dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously harmed by the upper body.
The authorities closed a beach entrance from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours in terms of study and safety.
Giles said that over 135 different types of sharks are in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to pick up fields on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s plan is to compete with Boots, SuperDrug, and Debenhams with a shopping center style and with specialized staff.
This is part of a plan to enter the beauty market in the UK, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds, and is growing as sales of fashion and home goods are declining. The larger beauty baskets will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and will be placed in more shops next year if well.
Pursuit investments are part of a large market to use a tilt-up lock that was previously used by television sets, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury’s claim is that it will double its cosmetic selection for up to 3,000 types of products, including products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store is also going to resell its boutique beauty selection so that the majority of the lips are vegan-friendly, but the younger consumers demand it more and more.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test a warehouse in two shops of Sainsbury’s, the first one opened in Croydon in South London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
An online store and an increased consumer tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in the neighborhoods mean that a large market needs to exert more effort to get people to come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury’s, said that the trades would be more and more like a shopping mall when the chain tries to fight against Aldi and Lidl low-end stores with more services and goods than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also reported on the number of Habitat stores since both chains were bought two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt at revitalizing the cosmetics and pharmaceutical sectors was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around 2000, so due to an analysis of how to share the proceeds of the sale of medicinal products in the supermarket.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 drugstores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds drugstores, in a total of 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will have a role in these programmes by adding a large selection of luxury skin marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, market manager Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve completely changed the look of our cosmetics shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in special training for staff who will be offered advice.
Our product selection is designed to meet all needs. Charming surroundings and comfortable locations make us an exciting beauty shop that transforms old commercial practices."
Peter Jones' 'eternalism' after Holly Willoughby's termination of a 11 million-dollar contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “eternalist” after the TV viewer Holly Willoughby terminated an 11 million-pound contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home goods and accessories, Truly.
The company had been likened to Goop, the brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
At 37 years of age, Willoughby announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has divorced Peter Jones, the star from Dragons’ Den, with a painful forehead by quitting participation in a popular lifestyle company at the last moment to focus on new and rewarding contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been “eager ” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at his headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the TV lady popularly admitted she did not have enough time for the home goods and accessories brand Truly because of the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been likened to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was designed to double Willoughby’s property, but their estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly’s flight from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
A source reported: “Truly was on Holly’s list of priorities.
This was to be her future assignment, which would take place in the next two decades.
Her decision to quit completely opened up to everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday; it was so short that the line went to the market.
There's a full stock of goods at Marlow's headquarters that's ready to sell."
Experts believe that the removal of the This Morning campaign, which is among the most popular stars in Britain, can cost millions of companies due to large warehouses, ranging from pads and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly further delay the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the three children of a mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends of Jones and Töra Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby, together with Capp, founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as chairman of the government in March.
The couples spend their summer fries together, and Jones shares 40 percent in Baldwin, a company that produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S trade mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as co-manager of the ITV components I'm a Celebrity.
A reference to Jones, a close friend, said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
A difficult discussion “and then we fell in love ”
He ignored the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate to the president, and for being so positive to the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
Trump said and echoed a reporter's voice.
'I haven't left anything'.
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On the other hand, discussions on the reduction of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the principal ambassador of North Korea, told international leaders at the General Assembly of the United States on Saturday that the north had not received an appropriate response from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that, instead, the United States continued its business lines for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was all the more positive in his meeting talk.
He said, "We come together very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim had brought about positive results — missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the remains of American soldiers were returned home.
He also spoke to Kim about his relationship with him.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to an island, hundreds have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international relief organization was told that there was no need for them.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the residents of Lombok had to flee from their homes, an emergency situation was not declared, but it is essential that an international organization can have a relief service there.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so that this is difficult," said Ms. Sumbung.
Although the Society Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign relief workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the situation in Palu would be appreciated by Indonesian authorities to see if the international community should be able to assist in the relief work.
Considering the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly badly prepared to defend its natural forces.
Flood waves have been built in Aceh, a rare sight on other shores.
It seems that even though a warning had been issued, the failure of flood defence plains in Palu still increased the rate of death.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
A medical vessel that has docked at the port of Lombok to observe that the victims of the earthquake are now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new location of the accident.
President Joko Widodo made it the main features of his campaign to improve the downside of Indonesia’s roads and railways.
However, lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko’s government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have developed a more conservative religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when the Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets with swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equals Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the final squad by scoring for 89 minutes at the Saturday game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's target when his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to target the vane.
The ball flew high above the target and toward its right corner.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch once and didn’t think so much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after Eden Hazard, a Belgian star, scored in 25 minutes.
On the visit, Chelsea’s visitor gave the ball with a handshake to Mateo Kovacic and then spread from the middle to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball move fast between the middle.
Then he sent the ball forward, and sent Hazard in for a honeymoon.
Hazard ran away and scored to the remote corner with a left leg shot past Alisson Becker, Liverpool’s goalkeeper.
Liverpool is playing against Napoleon in the prefecture at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is playing against Videoton in the UEFA European Council at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths increases to 832 after a flood in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the flood in Indonesia has increased to 832 as reported by the National Disaster Agency early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Institute, said at a press conference that a number of people had been buried when the buildings collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
The city of Palau, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest a 32-year-old suspect in murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been started after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have encouraged people in the area to submit if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is right, but I want to ask all those in the neighborhood of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
Also, I would like to ask everyone, especially a taxi driver, who might have taken a picture of his car cameras to contact us, because they could have had important information for our research."
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was this morning.
The study continues, and police say they are working to inform the immediate victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him that no one could come into the building or leave it.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People have now been told that many hours could pass until they can go back in.
A police officer heard a man say that the whole area now counts as a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She continues: “This is so terrible. ”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the police station and one car just outside.
The number of police officers stood within the marked area and watched the residential buildings.
Anyone who could have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact the crime scene on the phone 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from September 30.
The statue of the British Senate of Cromwell is the newest memorial accused of 'rewriting history'
The ban of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his paranoid Puritan escorts on so many of England’s cultural and religious gems.
The Cromwell Company, however, said that Mr. Crick's suggestion was 'poor' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about removing statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be put before the battle.
The English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither an order nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas of the century before.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the 19th century period and is part of a story that many believe still to be commended.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to be the protector of the Congress against external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
Whether this description is entirely correct is still a historical issue.
However, the conflicts that existed in the mid - 17th century may have shaped the evolution of our people and that Cromwell is a well - known person who represents one side of their struggle.
It is worth hoarding and remembering his accomplishments as the Protector of the Kingdom."
Pigs attack and kill a Chinese farmer
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwest China, according to local news.
The man named only by his last name “Yuan” was found dead with a broken artery and covered blood close to a stem on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou district, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig establishment on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
According to him, he had traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door to the nearby pig house was open.
He said that inside there had been a large glare with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a trial confirmed that 250 kg had killed the farmer.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded," said the uncle, with the last name "Wu", at Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera recorder showed Yuan to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not in the possession of Yuan or his uncle.
The market owner told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that no one else would be attacked while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to news reports, the Yuan family and the market owners have discussions about the consequences of his death.
There are recorded cases of swine attacking people, although rare.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and seriously wounded the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig clamped a farmer on a tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another man from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that their blood can arouse aggression.
“They’re just playing.
They're curious and they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them their respect," he said.
The remnant of the hurricane of Rosa carry a great deal of results over the southwest part of the United States
As foretold, the hurricane’s strength is decreasing as it crosses the cooler sea at the northern coast of Mexico.
On the other hand, there will be great results for Rosa, which may result in floods in northern Mexico and southwest America in the days to come.
On Sunday, at 5 o’clock in the morning, Rosa became a class 1 hurricane, with a wind force of 136 km per hour, and it was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will be heading north on Sunday.
At the same time, the formation of the Pacific Ocean will move east to the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, a large tropical rocket will follow northward into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of output in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical flakes will mix with the low that approaches and form a vast and wide expanse over the southwest part of the next days.
Local values of 2.5 to 10 cm may cause dangerous rapid currents, soil movement and possible steps in the desert.
A lot of tropical flakes will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation at an hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of output is expected at some points in the southwest part, especially in the largest Arizona state.
There is a potential for rapid flooding with rapidly worsening conditions because of the spread of tropical rain.
People are strongly advised to avoid walking into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
A great deal of rain can turn waves into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms can lead to a rush and a storm of dust.
The medicinal product approaching will be applied locally in certain areas at the southern California shoreline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of the result, which could cause slight movement of the soil and the neck on the roads.
This is the first occurrence of the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the outbreak spread across a larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great deal of results will spread over four states on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
Much heat changes are expected in October everywhere in the United States, as the Arctic region cools down, but the heat is still somewhat warm.
Sometimes this can cause a lot of hot spots over short distances.
A very good example of high temperature in the central United States was seen on Sunday.
There's almost 7 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, ongoing summers will try to build up and resuscitate.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern parts of the United States will warm the beginning of October with a temperature of about 25 degrees or more from the plains of the south to the northeast.
The temperature could reach 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees Fahrenheit [6 ° C] higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecasts indicate that there is a high probability of temperature above the average for the eastern United States in the early part of October.
Over 20 million people were interviewed by Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday, and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual immorality that was to take place in the 1990 ’ s, and the witness was sent out on six different channels.
At the same time, the political petition continued, and television stations interrupted a regular program to publish Friday’s latest news: Jeff Flake, a Arizona senator, presented a bill for the FBI to investigate the charges for one week.
Ford told the Senate judicial committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to strip her off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional testimony, said that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company measured the average viewing of the TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels that showed the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen, too, is usually in trouble measuring the audience in the office.
To put this in context, this audience is similar to the size of a final football game or the Oscar Award Festival.
According to Nielsen, most of the interviews, which took all day, were on Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was still much interest after the trial.
Flake was at the heart of the ball game on Friday.
After the office of this congressman’s Republica group announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favor, the CNN and CBS took pictures of when Protestants called on him on Friday morning, when he tried to go into the elevator to get a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while shame rained on him on the live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said: “I stand right here in front of you. ”
"Do you think he's telling the people the truth?"
People told him: “You have authority while so many women are powerless. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he said that he would rather express himself at the committee’s meeting.
The Cape and TV stations all had direct transmission later when the Judicial Committee decided whether Kavanaugh’s appointment should be forwarded to the Senate.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the appointed ones next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged.
In part, Flake became convinced by a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, a Democratic Senator.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and some other senators thereafter.
Flake’s vote changed because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accuses critics of 'being in political affairs' for Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to withdraw from the European Union to "be in political affairs" about the future of Britain and undermine its interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will be attending the Birmingham, United Kingdom Conference on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published next to her interview on the cover page, Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, was awarded the so-called Chequers Plan on Brexit and said that the claim that the United Kingdom and the European Union should impose customs duties on each other would be 'excessive'.
The Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting, and he was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second - degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims had lost his glasses in the fight.
According to WAFB, CBS, the police found glass eyes on the scene and reported that they had genetics from Simpson.
The police say Simpson confessed to hearings that he had shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a certain guarantee that a sum of $350,000 would be paid.
The Justice Officer's office in East Baton Rouge County issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death is gunshot to the head and down to the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the Special Forces of Louisiana, the police department at the University of Southern University, and the local authorities for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of the LSU sports team, thanked lawyers for “their zeal and their search for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two - foot - long [2 m] protrusion grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and took 2.6 per game during the last season.
Will Wade, LSU’s basketball coach, said on Friday morning that the team had been “smoked” and“ in shock” because of Wayde’s death.
"This is something you worry about all the time," said Wade.
Mountain spues ashes across Mexico City
Ash from Mount Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended that Mexicans stay away from the mountain on Saturday after an increase in activity and 183 gas - and - ashes cases were recorded over a period of 24 hours.
The center was watched by vibrating and shaking from the volcano.
Photographs from the community media showed a thin layer of ashes on car windows in nearby Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Physicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, from the earthquake of 7.1 on the Richter crossing the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The Mount of Fire, known as the Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with the Catalan apartheid just before the anniversary of the voluntary award
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants joined the riot police and thousands participated in protests on the occasion of the first anniversary of the controversial election in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked sepulchers stoned unbridled policemen with eggs and threw dust paints that formed dark dust on the streets, which were usually filled with tourists.
Later on, conflicts broke out, and police used batons to control attacks.
The separationists cried out: “We shall not forget and forgive” for an hour or so, while their opposers cried out: ‘ Long live Spain. ’
Fourteen needed attention because of the minor injuries they suffered during the protests, according to the local media.
A lot of excitement continues in the self - centered area one year after the National Act of October 1st was declared illegal by the authorities of Madrid, but it was celebrated by the Catalan apartheid.
The majority of the voters opted for independence, but participation was poor, since most of those opposed to separation ignored the election.
According to the Catholic authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when policemen tried to stop the election at election locations around the area, which led to conflicts.
On Friday, groups of independence had stayed overnight to prevent protests from supporting the nation’s police.
The protests went on, but they were forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electric generator, joined his wife’s protests with protests of separation, saying that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Last year, we had some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a necessary but limited victory in the final district exams in December, Catalonia’s independence groups have had difficulty keeping steam this year, since many of the best - known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention waiting for court proceedings because of their role in organising the award of the contract and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who took up protests in support of the police, said that politicians from both states had encouraged this conflict.
"The tension is constantly increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison waiting for trial from the late last year, announced that he would volunteer to the European Parliament next year.
He said, "My message in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the oppression that we have seen the Spanish government use."

The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that a crossbow may have been shot to the direction of the vehicle.
Mixing Score 1-0 Livingston Against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed Livingston's victory
Team Livingston, who came from the lower division, put Rangers in an open shield, and Steven Gerrard had to face his second loss in 18 games as manager of team Ibrox.
Mark Dolly Menga did the fortune and the team Gary Holt's is now second with the Hibernian.
The Gerrard team has not yet worked in the field in the prime of this season and is playing against the Hearts, which are eight points ahead of the top, the next Sunday.
Before this game, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the European Parliament on Thursday.
At the same time Livingston is still invincible with six victories, and Holt's main coach has not yet had to experience any loss since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against bitter visitors
The Holts should have been over a long time before it scored a goal, but their directness caused Rangers a great deal of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot by after running through the defense to receive a bald shipment from Gray Halkett across the finish line.
The guests let Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause trouble to the guests in the right places.
And that was the way the goal was cut.
Rangers got an extra effort, and Livingston worked to create a goal opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who accepted the shipment and scored from the middle of the range.
At that point, Rangers had taken control of the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, did not have to work hard.
So it continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos had managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, Ranger's target, and Lithgow shot from the finish line after a visit from Livingston.
While livingston was being kicked out of, the ghosts constantly landed, and two demands for a waitress - after Halkett's defense against Glenn Middleton, and one after another - were dismissed.
Livingston’s “Beautiful ” Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and outcome for Livingston.
For an ordinary man, they stood by wonderfully and continued to exceed all expectations of their way of life.
Their playing style and their team members have hardly changed anything since they returned to the top division, but Holt deserves much commendation for having pushed the team together from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, a leader was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they played far under expectations.
They failed to complete their visits and only once managed to open up half of the locals, so this should be a wake-up call for Rangers, now in the middle of the league.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
It was a smile and bright sky on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two nations of NATO.
Differences have been identified between them as a result of issues such as human rights, media trafficking and the integration of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to open a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish residents outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters were able to see their president nearby.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of German governments to invite him to the country.
The two protesters reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as a devout by others.
Invasion of Deptford: A wheelman killed himself in a car
A rider killed himself in London’s car.
The conflict occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a common street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at 10.15 a.m.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics responded, but the man died in an accident.
The collision occurred several months after another rider killed himself in a collision where a driver drove off on Childreners Street, one mile [1.5 km] from Saturday’s accident site.
The police said that she was working to identify the man and let his immediate associates know.
The road has been closed and the bus is on the other side, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six will be wounded in riots
Six prisoners were wounded when riots broke into a men’s security prison, as reported by a prison agency.
In the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, riots broke out at 9:30 a.m. to British local time on Sunday and still toss.
Special officials have been called to the territory to try to prevent the riots of eight prisoners and are only in one of the prison branches.
The guards received attention because of minor injury to the face in the field.
One prison spokesman said: “Specially trained jailers have been called out to deal with events that run into the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have received treatment for injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible are going to be handed over to the police and that they might spend even more time behind locks and bars."
More than 500 prisoners are in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison director had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, a riot police officer was called on the spot to deal with a serious disturbance in peace, where workers were attacked with billiards.
The Rósa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapids (dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical region to cross Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remains of the tropical region of Rosu cross the southwest, with a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Station has already issued alerts for rapid flooding by Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona and the south and west parts of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that on Tuesday, Rose passes over Phoenix and arrives late on Monday with a result.
The Phoenix Weather Station said on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes have reached the strength to class as tropical storms or lowers in less than 200 miles [320 km] away from Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 60 miles away from the Arizona border."
The last predictions from the hurricane center of the country predict 5-10 cm of output, with an occasional output of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that the result will be 2.5 to 5 cm in other regions of the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of unique results up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of rapid flooding, the result from Rosa may be a blessing, as there are many droughts in the area.
Although floods can cause great damage, some of these results will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought control, there is at least a very high drought to more than 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest category," according to weather.com reports.
First, the hurricane of Rosa will reach the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind intensity of 136 km per hour, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler sea in the Pacific, so its power decreases.
It is therefore expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on the afternoon of Monday or Monday night.
There is a high potential for some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the output will be 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with a potential of up to 25 cm output," said a report from weather.com.
Then Rosa will cross Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach Arizona’s border early on the third morning as a tropical region. Then she will continue through Arizona and arrive at the southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
“The highest risk expected from Rosa or her remains is very high in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and southwestern desert region of the United States, ” said the National Center of Hurricane.
This outcome is expected to cause life - threatening rapids and movements of soil in the deserts, and climbs to the end of the mountain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for homicide
Three teenage boys and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested for suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The youth was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 p.m., at a British local time on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition is said to be “steady. ”
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - old, and one 20 - year - old, were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked for a witness who might have phone records of what happened to give up.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “got to feel the evil and anger ” of the Democratic Party
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote which rejects the unmerciful and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump, with supporters in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “got to feel the evil and the anger ” of the Democratic Party out of all his nominations.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the assembly on Thursday, where he harshly denied the accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the committee about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “The Americans had seen the genius and quantity and courage of Kavanaughh the other day. ”
"Confirming a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of today's most clever lawyers, a lawyer with an excellent career record as a public employee," he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republican supporters in the mid - term reviews.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't offer myself, but I really do," he said.
“That’s why I go all over the world to fight for great proponents.”
Trump argued that democrats were working “to silence and hinder. ”
The first key payment on the floor of the Department of Elders regarding the appointment of Kavanaughh should be made no later than on Friday, according to the assistant director of the Republics in the interview with CNN.
Hundreds died of earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and likely the number of dead will rise.
At least 384 died, and many were washed away for a huge wave on the shores, when great earthquakes and floods raged over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six feet [6 m] high waves hit the beach at sunset, washed many people out of the sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The tidal wave was formed after an earthquake of 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [7.5 ° C].
“When the tide started yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an Indonesian disaster spokesman, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
"The wave of floods did not come alone, she brought cars, trees, houses, she struck everything in the country," Nugroho said and added that the wave of floods had traveled over the open sea at 800 miles [800 km] before she hit the beach.
Some climbed a tree to escape the wave of the Flood and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster agency’s aerial photographs showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted bridges, and destroyed mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride over the beach on Saturday.
The order of the earthquakes was found in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s foundation for food and technology, stated that the energy that came out of a slump during the big quake on Friday would have been some 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, at the end of a long and narrow flood, may have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said the damage was “precious ” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had collapsed.
The body of a few victims was found trapped under wrecks of broken buildings, said he and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss and damage to property could be greater along the shoreline 300 km north from Pala, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the surface of the earthquake.
Communication from Donggala, Nugroho, said: “There is no information at all, and no information is available. ”
“Over 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but could be much worse," said the Red Cross.
The foundation was criticized by many on Saturday for not telling us that a flood bomb had swung on Palau, although public representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on social media, you could hear a cry from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that a floodgate was approaching.
Just a minute later, the flood wave on the beach strikes and carries off buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused powerlessness that prevented communication with Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
The army has begun to send relief aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the territory still need a great deal of food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit refugee centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people who are dead goes over 800 after a flood in Indonesia.
Things are very bad.
The staff of the World Vision of Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they seek refuge in the cities of tents set up in the garden outside their offices, and destroyed them on their way, according to Mr. Dosebah.
“ People said they saw many houses destroyed, ” he said.
Things are very bad.
Help groups have started a hard work of relief, but some have complained that foreign relief workers with high expertise have been prevented from traveling to Palu.
In accordance with Indian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff can only start if the disaster zone is declared a disaster zone.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a local accident zone," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open up to foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell upon Palu after the earthquake and the flood wave on Friday, friends and families who are still missing held in hopes that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous tales that sparked the destructive prefaces of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, trainer of the Indonesian glider team, had been the trainer of two now missing gliders for the Asian games that ended earlier in that month in Indonesia.
Others locked up in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hour after the news came to an end, because the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he had sent WhatsApp messages in despair to the rivals who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His messages, on the other hand, showed only a grey mark, instead of a blue one.
“ I think it meant that the messages were not received, ” he said.
Stealing thieves $26,750 at a fast bank in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink’s staff, who were filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee, as reported by the Newport police.
The driver of the car had been emptying an instant bank in the entertainment area and was about to spend more money on him, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the announcement.
When he was doing his job, another man came “running behind the Brink worker ” and stole a money bag that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, as reported, but police did not reveal how many were involved.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name in Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name--in Ye.
He announced the change to Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The creature formerly known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album that came out in June.
The change occurs for his participation in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the show, but for “emotional reasons, ” the manufacturer said.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a statue of his present name.
“I think that ‘ye’ (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’ West said earlier in the year when he discussed the name on his record with the radio director Big Boy.
“So that I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, who translates the one, and into only Ye--to be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The record is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous warriors who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-worker, has also written his name both with and without bounds and capitals.
The elected president of Mexico promises not to use the military against the general population
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians, now that the country will soon remember 50 years of bloody revenge.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised that “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers shot a peaceful protest march in the square and dropped up to 300 people a time when the students ’ left - winged movements were taking root in all of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving monthly strength to all students and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attract young people to criminal activities.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
Now that China is becoming more active in artificially-diagnosed, the United States should double the funding it has in its research in that field, says the inventor and the artificial user Kai-Fu Lee who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The reference was made after the various branches of the United States government announced artificial intelligence, even though the United States did not have a formal overall plan on artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in creation with artificial intelligence before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the amount of money that will be spent on artificial research, given that all other countries are so much farther behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major discovery will be made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, the author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order ” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of the company Sinomation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading artificial companies.
He worked on an artificial intelligence system in the '90s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was the manager of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Department at Google.
Lee referred to previous technical competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as the defense robotic competition, and asked when the next race would be held to spot the next pioneers.
According to Lee, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get strength from the government.
“It’s not China that takes the lead in thinking, it’s the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired engineers from universities to work with artificial intelligence in the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their satellite research.
"I think that those who have a doctorate in artificial science should be granted a residence permit automatically," he said.
Congress of China published its forward-looking plan in July 2017.
According to Lee, the China Institute of Natural Science provides funds to people who work at universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar to public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China.
Earlier this year, the United States Ministry of Defence set up an artificial center to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had an investment of $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it invests over 100 million dollars a year in artificial research.
At the same time, the United States legislation designed to establish a self-reliance safety committee has not been in place for months.
The Macedonians opt for a national allowance for whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia opted for a national grant on Sunday on the question of whether the country's name should be changed to the 'North Macedonia People's Republic' in an attempt to resolve decades of disagreement with Greece, which has closed off their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and claims that its neighbours’ name in the north is equivalent to their territory’s requirement and therefore denied entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opposers argue that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of Macedonia’s inhabitants of Slavonic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts as to whether he or she would be able to reach the 50 - percent minimum threshold, which would make it considered valid.
The question on the campaign paper is as follows: “Do you want to go to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ”
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a reasonable price for Macedonia to join the alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough Congressmen have said that they will comply with it and bind it to law.
The change of names would require approval of two thirds of the Congress.
The election committee said that nothing unusual had been announced at 1 o’clock in the afternoon.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last roll-call votes in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old voter in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, Zorica’s wife and their son, Dushko, paid their vote in the National Reconciliation in Macedonia on whether to change the country’s name, but it would pay for its way into NATO and the European Union, in Scumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Senate in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents built by those who will ignore the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service door," said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to agree to us as Macedonia, we can turn to one another like China or Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO will provide the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the longest majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the country's citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after paying his vote.
He said that agreement would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from Macedonia’s Political Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national grant, which is less than the minimum required.
Another survey from Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to pay their votes on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they were going to say yes.
In order for national payments to be considered valid, a 50 - percent plus one vote must be met.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock to the policy of the Western government since its adoption in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the defense Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling went lightly with the defense of Brighton in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentinean advance received a shipment at the center of the field at the beginning of the visit.
He sprang past three Brighton defenders and then went out to the open field.
Aguero then became surrounded by four fenced defenders.
He got past one of his defenders and then ran away from a few more right at Brighton's stand.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forwarder used the first touch within the body to send the ball back to Aguero, which used the right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, the target lighton, with a shot at the right side of the target.
"Aguero has some foot-and-mouth issues," said Pep Guardiola, managing director of City, to reporters.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the great league game.
That point came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a shipment far in the field half of Brighton on that visit.
He sent a magnificent long ball to the left of Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent Sterling toward the far pole.
The advance city sent the ball to the net just before it ran off.
City is playing against Hoffenheim in the Championships at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game of rockies
Since the Nationals have been excluded from playing in the finals, there was little reason to force a second start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to get tossed on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have the chance to get to the finish, but they have a single-playing lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies got at least a wild card seat with their 5-2 victory at Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to reach their first title.
“ Even though we play free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as the other team will certainly play their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals will still report on who will be the first thrower in Sunday’s game, but it is thought that they will throw Scherzer at those events.
Scherzer, who would begin the 34th time, took a exercise session on Thursday and would roll on a Sunday, which is his normal day of rest.
This right - handed thrower at Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 blows for 220 2/3 cycles during this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president referred directly to the matter around Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge when he spoke of the importance of the supporters of the Republics participating in the mid - term reviews.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I don't offer myself, but I do, so I go all over the world to fight for the great proponents," he said.
Trump continued, saying: “You see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means are necessary, you see the cruelty, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to get power and government, they just want government and government, we don't give it to them.
He said that democrats were working “to keep quiet and to stop. ”
"And it has been seen in the past four days," he said, saying democrats are "rage and evil and cruel and untrue."
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Governing Body of the Governing Body of the Governing Body of the Governing Body, by name, and was answered with a loud voice from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who did it?
Ha, what.
No, no, no. I waited in one... it was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The working class is no longer a tolerant church.
He Cannot Cope With Those Who Express His Mind
When the operative Moments of my group chose to give me a statement, it hardly came as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of many members of the Workers ’ Party who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our mind.
Joan Ryan, my associate, received similar treatment, for she strongly opposed prejudices against Jews.
In my case, I was accused of making comments because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically similar issues to those of Jeremy’s previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be nonexistent and effective. ”
In my eight - year career as member of the Workers ’ Party, Friday meetings have been the most frequent.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a "milder and better" politics has been forgotten if it ever began.
It has become more and more evident that differing views have not been passed by the Workers ’ Group and that all opinions are judged as to whether they are acceptable to the leaders of the Group.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when fellow workers, whom I thought I had previously had similar political views, began to expect me to take full advantage of and support opinions that I had never previously agreed on, whether they were national security or a common EU market area.
So every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a bit of disdain on the social media where I'm called after my expulsion, middle-level politics, and I'm saying I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, since most of the speeches I receive are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and affirmation of those who have to endure the holocausts of sexual or prejudiced insults daily but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is how insults and attacks have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers ’ Party should pay attention to an tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of a church, and with every lack of confidence or change in rules, the class becomes increasingly narrow.
I’ve been given many advice in the last two years not to be overly high and would be “all right ” with me.
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers ’ Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my schoolroom at denunciation, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most, whether I was in local government or at a council.
I have never hidden my political views, nor my last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm the home, company and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Workers' Party.
But my only message, which I would like to send from me, is not to Nottingham Moments, but to those who are within my heart, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I serve you proudly, and I promise that no threats of aberration or political expulsion will deter me from doing what I consider to be for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns might have cracked the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this momentous game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership department.
They are now at the top of the list and one of ten that is still undefeated.
In the end, their protection and better use of opportunities made the locals more successful, and Peter Murchie coach was fully entitled to be happy.
“We’ve got a strong opposition in our games up here, and we’re still invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Observe praise, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we do. ”
Mark Grant Anderson came over Ayr in 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the call on, but a yellow card on the Scottish chairman, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot scored the touchdown.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr with hell before he scored with a kick just before half the game and then touched the touchdown and came Ayr over 17-5 to half the game.
However, Melrose started a second half of his career, and Patrick Anderson, after Baggot returned, reduced the goal difference to five points.
Then took a long time to cover serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, which had to be carried out at a playground, and after that Ayr still increased his leadership with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned on the visit.
Blair Macpherson, lead Ayr, then got the yellow card, and Melrose once again took advantage of being a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough visit.
On the other hand, locals came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for having made Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's campaign, after an extra effort.
Climo turned the visit to, as he did again immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe reached the kick David Amrstrong from the cabin and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touch mark of the team.
The stars of the Still Game are ready for a new career in the restaurant editor.
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game features, seems ready to move into the restaurant sector after he learned that he was appointed manager of the restaurant business.
Kieran, 56 years old, Jack Jarvis, in the BBC, plays the popular feature, which he writes and plays with his old partner from the entertainment business, Creg Hemphil.
Two reports have been made that the upcoming ninth series will be the last, and it seems that Kühr has plans for Craiglang’s life after.
According to official records, he's the manager of Aktriebmorn Limited.
The player didn't want to say anything about the story, but the author of Scottish Sun insisted that Kühr wanted to participate in the "living restaurant business" Glasgow City.
'The sea is ours': the shoreless land of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are guarding the fleet’s headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Fleet stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are marked by the slogan: “We have rights to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
Around all the land, Bolivia’s memories of the shoreline, lost to Chile in a bloody 19th - century battle, still in a fresh memory — along with its desire to reintroduce the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unification, and the restlessness, and is, of course, waiting for the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomate.
Many inhabitants of Bolivia will be monitoring the International Court’s decision on large - scale screens all over the country, hoping that the Court of Justice in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia in favor of its requirement that Chile be obliged to grant Bolivia access to, after many decades of difficult talks.
The Monday decision is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indians, who will have a controversial campaign for reviews next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised late in August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court decided in favour of Bolivia, and that if he did so it would not change very much.
The court, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to give land to Sile and has decided that the decision will not affect the outcome of the discussion.
The fact that the court’s decision comes only six months after the final discussion indicates that the case “has not been complicated, ” said international Chilean expert Paz Sárate.
It is also possible that over the past four years, it has not been the case with Bolivia to the fore, but it has caused the country to return.
"The current Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She considered that Morale’s harsh speech has eroded all the goodwill of Sile.
Boliviah and Sile will one day continue to talk, but it will be very difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged for ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the Hague State, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Sile ” and the opportunity to“ end a conflict of 139 years in time, both countries for the better, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use this subject as a political hill.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past. ”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted by the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Secretary of State of North Korea, says the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His speech now comes as Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be reintroducing talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is 'dreamers' to continue the commercial prayer and protest against the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korea War will ever kneel down to North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes concrete steps to dismantle his nuclear weapons first.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are serious doubts that Pyongyang is taking down weapons that the country is likely to consider as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris will present the latest line of big scalps that will appear in the fashion stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat library or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not have to search further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed many strange hats in their superior size for their SS19 line on the fashion scene that attracted the toll on the fashion week in Paris.
The number of photographs of very inappropriate hats has been published on Instagram in the summer, and these designers have had their innovative creations on display in fashion shows.
Valentino’s main work was a large, light - brown hat with a wide body of feathers, covering the head of the bogs.
Of other supersize components, watermelons could be seen setting gems, slipper hats, and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced many strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were combined, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they were in the high fashion.
One mask resembled a snorkeling device with a ventilator and a glass of glass, while others resembled a melting ice in bread form.
If you want to play the bitch, you're lucky.
Tisk experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come with a dose on the heels of 'La Bomba', a straw hat with over 60cm [60cm] of brimstone, which has adorned the head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion label behind the very inappropriate hat, seen on all the social media, was inspired by another major part of the fashion scene — a neckline beach bag that was almost the same size as the swimsuit model that carried it.
The orange stripper, with a strawberry and a white leather handle, was the main part of La Riviera SS10 Jacquemus clothing line in the fashion week of Paris.
Luke Armitage, the famous stylist, said to FEMIIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer - because the designer has caused such a big impact should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized parts. ”
John Edward: A Global Citizens Needs to Doomsday
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding achievements of their students and have continued in 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still supported by individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other social activities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) defending them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further further education, the career they have chosen, and their position as a world citizen.
As a teaching sector that can assemble and teach specialized study programmes, we see that new things continue to be popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
"If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list of the highest proportion of students who pass tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received A.
The data collected from 74 schools in the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the A - mandarin quality grade, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
At the moment, language, as an option, is put in the same place as a science - related study material (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for reasons that employers indicated difficulties in recruiting, 17 percent were because of a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future tasks.
Now that more and more jobs are required in languages, this skill is needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future, which is an end to life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give more weight to a person the advantage of the competitors.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough for conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two letters a percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language education.
Many people, especially in new countries, will give children a better opportunity to find important jobs.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A certain number of schools will focus on new classics, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Britain when looking to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialised teachers.
Schools undertake to offer themselves to study environments that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying that at this time, in the global business environment, language remains necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be viewed as “an international skill in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity, and superiority to young people in Scotland.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edwards, chairman of the Scottish Private School Council
LeBron plays its first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The waiting is soon to be over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Coach Lakers, has announced that James will be playing on Sunday in the opening game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
“It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48,” said Walton on Laker’s official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his schedule for six Lakers games before the start of the season.
“During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare, ” he said.
Timing for Trump's election meeting in Western Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a large number of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop at a friendly location, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, Trumpet suggests building up support for the next mid-term review, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when a vote is taken in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in Western Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin at 7:00 a.m. to the east beach time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump meeting in Western Virginia on the web below through live YouTube broadcasting.
It is likely that Trump will refer the case to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court judge, who was stressed for the allegations of sexual assault, to confirm him as a judge until a week before the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main goal of Trump’s meeting is to help the Republicans get their way better, but they are waiting for a tough election in November.
Thus, the announcement from Trump’s campaign that these five meetings that will be held next week was aimed at “filling volunteers and supporters with zeal as the Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the elders and councils, ” according to Reuter’s news agency.
"The presidency's government is so necessary for the President's plan that it will travel to as many states as possible when a careful campaign is about to begin," said an independent spokesman from Trump's campaign at Reuters' news agency.
Tonight the meeting will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the media from Pittsburgh will tell him, ” according to the West Virginia Metro News News Office.
The Saturday discovery will be Trump's second visit to Western Virginia this month, but he won over 40 percent will in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the volunteer repulsives in West Virginia to the Senate, but he's down in the polls.
"It is not good for Morrissey to know that the President needs to come and try to increase his popularity," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters' news agency.
Ryder the Cup 2018: The United States is fighting to keep the hope alive for the individual competition on Sunday
After three rounds of one - sided laps, the late - day fourth could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
A successful transition is a concept of sports that has been invented and that is truly believed by players, and never more than in the competition like this.
Where would they say that success is now subdued?
“They had a six-point lead, and now it’s four points, so success is more on our side now, I guess,” said Jordan Spieth when he set off in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has its head, four points ahead, with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have some wind in their sails, and they can hope for many, especially for Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a great deal to the point of flatness, leading with his example.
As he passed the ring, the cheers increased, and he put down an important piece of paper to take all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below two.
His pledge, which gave them victory in the 15th hole, received a similar shout of joy, one of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has hope.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," said Spieth.
It's the only thing these players can do right now.
18 holes to enter points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder.
This strange but thrilling European couple have won four games and cannot do anything wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only couple who got into the afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid turning on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and the nine holes on Friday mornings.
The play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, is the sun sitting across the Le Golf National site.
The best option would be that both did so simultaneously in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the quarter in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Sweep dug into a hole that they never managed to scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quadruples and the quadruples are so exciting to watch closely because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how the game can change in one stage.
Europe has played better as a team here and has a considerable advance before the end of the day, but this fourth round also showed that the American team has had the battle will that some had doubted it had, especially the other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good start for the final day of Ryder the Cup after a four-ball and four-game Saturday, with the premise 10-6 against the United States.
The asteroid Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who were in difficulty, and received four points at the Le Golf National Field.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to regain the prize cup, which it lost at the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the American team in the four - ball game of the morning and won 3-1.
The U.S. showed greater opposition to the quadruples and won two games but failed to win the score.
Jim Fury’s team needed eight points from 12 people on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who had the nickname "Molliwood" after a wonderful weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four - ball game, they showed a great team and won the demise of Woods and the U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his geniuses, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four ball games and four games, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was settled for the four-ball game of the morning, came back to his partner, Henrik Stenson in the matches, and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka--who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not go all the way on this mild and lovable day of southwest Paris.
Three times winner in the golf major, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back and won Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the matches after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of Ryder the cup that a team has won four points of difference at the start of an individual race, although the team of Furiks would only need equal force to continue the cup.
However, after two days of second - best service, a counterattack on Sunday seems to overpower them.
North Korea says one-sided disarmament "impossible" without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the U.S. government on Saturday that a continuing trade ban would only cover their distrust in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to bring down its nuclear weapons solely under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the United States that North Korea had resorted to “representative measures to show goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and rocket tests, taking down the nuclear test site, and promising to risk the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t seen a corresponding response from the United States, ” he said.
'Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country's security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take one side down our nuclear weapons first.'
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to the "situated" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it had taken, his declaration seemed to be unique in that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament purely out of the way Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first meeting between the U.S. President and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on the 'nuclear disarmament of the Koreans' and Trump issued a promise to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to bring a formal end to the Korean War between 1950 and 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons after the first time.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the strict ban on business against North Korea.
"The United States demands that "nuclear disarmament take its first place" and increase pressure by using a commercial petition to reach its own goal, even contradicting the declaration to end the war," said Ri.
“ It’s just a dream of people who don’t know anything about us thinking that a business request can get us on our knees.
But the problem is that our ongoing clientele increases our distrust."
Ri didn't mention any plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, who was the leader of the United States of America talking about at the U.S. earlier this week.
Instead, the secretary spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, leader of South Korea for the past five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be a plight in the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Koreans.”
In spite of this, Ri’s speech was very different from his speech last year when he said at the General Assembly of the United States that it was inevitable to label rockets from North Korea on the continent of the United States after “the Devil’s President ” Trump called Kim a “light rocketman” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to “bring” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that a business request had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame in this regard, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
On the other hand, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council's mandate must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it has been confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase the trade ban on North Korea from 2006 in an effort to close the funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the U.S. Army Congress and told him that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that the results had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for “criminal demands.”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down a rocket area and a nuclear station if the United States resorted to "corresponding action."
He said that Kim had said that the “corresponding actions ” he sought were guarantees of security that Trump promised in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to resist the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing about the basics of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of dormitory medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and the women’s hospital, designed the course and thinks that it sees the first of its kind in the United States.
After giving a lecture on the effect that sleep deprivation has on learning, he got the idea of doing the course.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to my door and asked: “Why is this saying to me first now, in my final year?
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The first - time course this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help train and performance in sports and even contribute to general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and director of the school’s health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after having found that students were very sleepless over the week.
The study is an hour of length and involves various helpful tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on a cup of coffee, a window tent, a sports shoe, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance can worsen the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how the long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Mapping over the school area with interactive symbols, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that still favors those who are awake and learners throughout the night, he said, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were growing problems.
Assuring that sufficient sleep would be good for good, students should be “secret ” to fight stress, tiredness, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid fattening, as lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is sedated.
Raymond So, 19 years old in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put together the course, but he sat one of the professor's carts last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all Masters to finish a similar course before they begin studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider adjusting the alarm clock, which reminds them of going to bed, and to awaken them, and bear in mind the harmful effects of blue light produced by electronic displays and LED light, which may confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had problems in the field. Stevens Gerrard's disunited team had to accept a 1-0 loss on Livingston, by mark from Dolly Menga.
Team Ibrox wanted to win his first victory in the field after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but team Gary Holt gave team Gerrards only his second loss in his 18 games as executive. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, which is at the top seat of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The amount of pollution scored seven minutes ago, and the Rangers ’ team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to recover.
Rangers now fall into sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only after the Hibernian in goal distinction.
Rangers may have had further problems after the caller Calum Spence had to receive attention because of head injury after some item was thrown into him from the visitor’s field half.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came to the conclusion in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, maintained the same 11 installation that reached the Hearts stage last week, and he would have been pleased with how well - trained his team of his forces were moving over the resistance.
Rangers may have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it reached.
They should've scored only two minutes after the game started when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he shot by.
Later, a long spare from Keaghan Jacobs ended up with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defensive partner, passed the long pole.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live rather than believe in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that when he and Steven Lawless joined him, he should have had a hell of a hell of a time when he and Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the call of the Colombian.
Rangers only got to take two shots in the first half of the game, but Liam Kelly, former target Ibrox, didn't have to have much to cover the baldness of Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Even though the opportunity of Livi had come in 34 minutes despite the fact that the other team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their perseverance.
Rangers failed again to do anything out of Jacob's long extra effort.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose to send it to Menga, who then easily scored.
Gerrard took his turn half-way and sent Ryan Kent into the place for Coulibaly, and the shifts had an effect almost immediately when the rear guard came in, but Kelly rushed in and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to fool the guests into playing just the game they enjoyed playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long shipment on their feet.
The Holts could have increased their lead on the final amines, but McGregor stood by to deny Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to the finish line.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's deputy, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson referred it back.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our calendar “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and ÁFRAM... this is the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
The Geiger measurement has been established in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the unlikely role of scientists:
Man: “What in the world is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger measured, used to detect radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these hearing aids on you, you can hear the effect of the atoms because of the radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It sure does break now! ”
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New anticancer vaccine can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New anticancer vaccine can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches your immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months, teaching immune cells to recognise dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute, Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our downsides indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “suffers various forms of cancer stopped growing,” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colon and rectum, said Berzofsky, professor.
A similar method in which immune cells are taken from patients and the "known" attack on cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long talk in support of Trump and carried MAGA there after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well.
In the studio of Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was held after a long talk in which he commended President Donald Trump and said that he would present himself to the President in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke against the democrats for a long time and repeated his support with Trump.
“ I’ve talked so often to white people who say, “How can you like Trump, he’s a race hater? ”
If I were concerned about racial hatred, I would have long been moved from the United States," he said.
The SNL began with a stick, where Hollywood star Matt Damon made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate judicial committee for the accusation of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the long-term West had not been sent out, the recording of it was put on the community media by Chris Rock.
It's not sure Rock wanted to make fun of the West by publishing the tape.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had received bad receptions from the back for his hating.
“ I was bullied in the back.
They said to me: “Don’t go up in the field with this cap. ”
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the reports of the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole? ” and said that he would put on his superhero dress “because that means you can’t order me for work, so do you want the world to make progress?
Try love."
At least two of his comments came from the audience, and according to Varitety, SNL’s actors seemed to be in a bad mood, and one attended the paper, “There was a stony silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to join the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, chairman of TPUSA’s maintenance team, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: TASK FOR THE VIEW OF THE MOTHER. ”
But on Twitter, part - time manager Karen Hunter said that West was simply “being himself and it’s wonderful. ”
“ But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list ”) whom I feel is supporting and expanding my harmful society.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the formerly known being Kanye West. ”
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion, and must not forget the musical myth Prince thenominal, who changed his name into a symbol and later called himself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Charged for attempted murder following a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to attend a trial in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticises poisoned masculineism
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old player, on the other hand, has criticized the image of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that “something went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic malehood during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his fellow queen from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions ” on how to deal with this matter.
"Personally, at the moment - what has gone wrong with manhood?"
"What have we taught men in their upbringing, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic male exposure, due to very male TV characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel as if they had to be made up of a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the time -- how do we change this?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong with young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any other parts of the Crown after the series resembled the following summer and said that he had received “ plenty of battlefields and horses. ”
Since November, Kit will be playing in the reconstruction of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his robber brother.
The player recently said that the best thing about playing at the Crown Games was seeing his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these parts, so that they would give me some kind of future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygridte, the lover of Jon Snow, who Kit played in these Emmy Prizes.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of the Lesli family in Scotland.
HIV/destiny: China reports a 14% increase in new transmission
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of countries infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health authorities say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new transmissions came through sex, which is a change from the previous one.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the administration of infected blood.
The number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way, however, has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a conference in the Yunnan region.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV transmission due to sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but major differences against LGBT are still reported.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other humans end up marrying a woman.
Many infections result from inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access for all to HIV medicines as part of its strategy to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from the Senate delegates, criticises “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy”
On Saturday, a congressman, Maxine Waters, denied the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information on their Wikipedia pages to three members of the Republican Senate.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said that these claims came from “superrights ” of extremes and Web sites.
“Lies, lies, and more pathetic lies,” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included the addresses and phone numbers of Utah’s Utah Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown party on Capitol Hill during hearings at Brett Kavanaugh’s appointed Supreme Court for the allegation of sexual assault.
The lesson came some time after the three Senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
The main pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP data identifying the source of the information was related to the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
“This unaccompanied accusation is completely wrong and pure lies,” continued Waters.
“My employee – what personal information and security are now at risk because of this wrong accusation – did not bear any responsibility in this information box.
This unexplained accusation is completely false and pure lies."
Water’s statement was quickly criticized online, including Ara Fleischer, former news representative of the White House.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
“ This indicates that she has no spirit to sit at a council.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
There must be no opposition.
This is not to be asked for reasons of accusation.
There must be calmness and meditation."
Fleischer seemed to compare water’s reaction to the critics ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who said that the critics said that they were too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the provocative replicas against Waters in the mid - term reviews, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“A big thing if it is true, ” he lamented.
In his declaration, Waters said that her office had been “informed by these untrue statements by appropriate authorities and law enforcement officers.
"We shall make sure that the guilty are found," she continued, "and that they shall be brought to justice for all acts that are corrupt and dangerous to all my servants."
A movie critic for Johnny English Strikes again - a spy film with Rowan Atkinson proves to be a little bit of power
It is now common practice to look for Brexit references in all new films in which Britain comes from, and this seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English comic book series - which started in 2003 with the picture Johnny English and just woke up again in 2011 with the picture Johnny English Reborn.
Will this plot of satira tell us how terrible we are as a new means of transport for the country?
Whether or not, Johnny English’s devastation, greed, and clumsiness have been renewed for a second time in order to ruin everything — his name shows above all that he is designed for a demonstration in other than English - speaking lands.
He is, of course, the wise, secret servant who pretends to have a fascinating personality but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one note for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening celebration of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious world citizen who Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he left everything in disarray.
There's one or two good points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walk to a helicopter dressed in a medieval newspaper and choppers in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his humorousness, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that “serious ” films such as James Bond and Mission Impossible also offer hilarious jokes.
The joke seems more suitable for children than for adults, and I found the adventures that Johnny English did not have as imaginative and focused as the silent grinsticks of Atkinson in Mr. Beans.
The ever - increasing assumption of the film is that Britain is in a lot of trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into Britain’s secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British spies, to the great dismay of the spy who is on duty - but unfortunately Kevin Eldon has too little role to play there.
This is the final line for the prime minister, who is arrogant and disputable, and already in great disrepute because of huge political upheavals: Emma Thompson does his best with his role as a person who should be reminded of Theresa May, but the manuscript is not on many fish for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already sat in a holy stone.
And that's where Johnny English himself comes from, now the headmaster of some fine school, but also provides a secret lesson in how to be a spy: Here are some funny jokes English offers at a spy school that reminds of the school of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting, where Bough, formerly a long - tired partner, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite make his light shine.
The spy venture that shatters everything in her Majesty's service has now returned to the girth and meets the houstache of Ophelia Bulletova, which is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is apprehensive about the charms of the billionaire of technology, who claims to be able to solve the British computer problem: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their decline: they set off in a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they cause trouble as they smuggle themselves into Volta’s luxury chain, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use display glasses to explore the interior of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but although the image is bold and powerful, it is not a matter of childish material in its entirety.
Medieval substance.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't help thinking, can a British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his skills?
The working group denies that it is preparing a four - day schedule for the UK, with the same salary as for five days a week.
The team of workers, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the report, the group wants to make savings from the revolution and allow employees to benefit from one additional holiday.
At that time, employees may spend three days on weekends without lowering their wages.
Sources say that the idea would be "accompanied" by the Group's economic plan and its policy of improving the benefits of the workforce.
Trade Union Congress has supported the job week’s recruitment for four days, which led workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Workers ’ Group official said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be reported before the end of the year.
"The change will not take place overnight, but four days of work is a goal appropriate to the approach of the group to change the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the overall industrial policy of the group."
The working class would not be the first class to support this idea, but the Green Group promised four days of work in its 2017 campaign.
The objective, however, is not supported by the Workers ’ Group as a whole.
The Workers ’ Group spokesman said: “Four days of working week is not on group policy and the group is not considering introducing it. ”
John McDonnell, secretary - general of the Shadow Ministry, used the Labour Party Conference last week to describe his ideas on social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain control of 'unknown leaders' and 'growths'.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that the current members of the water body companies may not be able to get their full share back, since the Workers’ Group’s government could resort to a “offload” of misdeeds.
It has also confirmed plans to assign employees to management committees and to create a common fund for ownership to give 10 percent of their employees property, which could receive 500 pounds a year from them in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether the investigation by the FBI at Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his appointment as Supreme Court judge, and raises the question as to whether its findings could have the Senate members of the Republic to withdraw their support.
During an interview that will be held on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the 60 - minute episode of the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could reveal something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked, “Did you do this? ”
He was determined, firm, undivided."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unalterable.
“ I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible charge to change it, ” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," added Graham and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she calls by name could not confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the International Civil Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City. It is an annual musical event where a series of great stars will appear and with a similar effectiveness; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Civil Festival, and tens of thousands of people will be brought to Central Park, not only to listen to music items such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival of ending severe poverty by 2030.
The International Civil Festival, which was first held in 2012, is part of the Global Power Project, which is an international fighting organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who are fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for the VIP ticket), there were many projects, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending e-mails to some of the world’s leaders, calling calls, or using other valid ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival been, now that 12 years are there to reach its goal?
Is the idea of winning people with free music really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just one so - called "smelling" operation - where people feel that it is doing something that matters by signing the list of requirements on the Internet or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions ” from its supporters, calling for many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies that amount to over 35 billion dollars, which will affect lives over 2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications for its operations, of which at least 10 billion have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the amount of money gathered here has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in Britain who work to “help children enjoy their full potential, ” promising to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British Government, the sponsors, governments around the world and international cities like you, we can leave the social injustice that is an malnutrition of the past," said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition at London's concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5000 appeals were sent that Britain should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On a list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is this: “Why do you think you can end up with a lot of poverty? ”
Global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail all the time.
However, we will achieve our goal, just like movements fought for the rights of citizens and for the deterrence of racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among the events this year are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae. The event will be held in New York and the students are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a 'hidden' to prevent Russia's energy exports, says the Minister of State for the Interior.
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East," says Ryan Zince, U.S. Secretary of State, as reported by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country works in the invitation of the legal government there, would be a pretext for exploring new markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern parts," he said according to the sources.
And, according to a public notice, there are ways and methods to resist it.
"The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea routes are opened and, if necessary, to create obstacles in order to ensure that the energy from them does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed a guest meeting at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called the “Red Energy Dance ” in the United States.
He continued and gathered Washington to deal with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more and less the use of energy supplies and to replace them with others,” he said, and said Russia has only one card in its economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements are based on the fact that Trump's government wants to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, public officials in Trump’s administration, and including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to set up a new power pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2 power supply, which will double the current transport capacity to 110 billion meters, is only a financial task.
Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that energy should not be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplies,” said Alexander Novak, Russian Energy Minister after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very uncomfortable with the fact that foreign states are switching from our power force," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “consider seriously” to present herself to the Presidential Office in 2020, she says.
On Saturday, Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said that she would “think seriously ” to present herself to the president after the mid - term polls.
Warren confirmed that she would consider inviting herself to a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and the law of our government, and then a woman as a leader, too," she said, according to a report from The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider presenting myself to the President.”
Speaking of President Donald Trump at the meeting, Warren said that he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has ignored his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court judge.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: “Of course we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote is taken. ”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of the electorate in Warren’s county do not believe that it should present itself in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the “probable ” voter in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be invited, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent said they supported her offer.
The survey showed greater support for the presentation of former government Deval Patrick, where 38 percent claimed to support his potential donation, and 48 percent claimed to oppose it.
Among other popular democrats who were discussed for a possible presidential presentation in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, senator of Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make a public decision in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the crisis disorder Track Palin at an election meeting at Donald Trump
The 26 - year - old Track Palin was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, and I feel with other families who are affected by the stress of shock and the spiritual wounds our soldiers return home,” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said that her son and other warriors“ came back only differently, they are hardened and wonder if there is any respect for what their military and military companions and other military departments have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent the announcement of domestic violence, and for the use of alcohol - induced weapons, according to Dan Bennett, police officer in Wasilla.
18 states and Washington D.C. support a challenge against a new policy of refuge search
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against a new U.S. policy that denies victims who flee gang or home violence for refuge.
Representatives of the 18 states and the city sent a report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who protests, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions’ application submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been given.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons, who were members of the gang, ” resorted to violence, but on July 20, her application for asylum was rejected by U.S. government officials.
She was put in Texas custody.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where gang - related problems and domestic violence are growing, with the number of asylum seekers in the United States coming from these countries.
In 2014, the new asylum search agency revokes the decision of the appeal committee of the immigrants to allow unregistered immigrants who fled from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Mr. Karl Racine, D.C. State Attorney, announced on Friday that the new policy “regarded several decades of federal and international law. ”
"The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be made based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule," said the Court of Justice.
In the report, the police also stated that the policy that denied immigrants entry was harmful to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up a company and “provide important jobs. ”
Jeff Sessions, a government prosecutor, ordered judges in immigration to stop giving shelter to victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Those who leave their home country because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular community or political opinion can apply for refuge,” said Sessions in their announcement on June 11th.
Intruders were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in the race to find survivors in Palu, the deadest double
Conditions are becoming increasingly difficult for survivors.
“There is a great deal of excitement in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son at the relief center in the city of Palau.
“ Cars bring dead bodies here all the time.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their devastated homes and looking in their waters to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds were wounded, and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged by the earthquake measuring 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, lay outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were invited to the outside due to continued vigorous resurgence.
His eyes were filled with tears when he told of how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the murals, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The United States Ambassador accuses China of 'victims' by means of 'radiation labels'
Week after an official newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the ambassadors of the United States of China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to distribute propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke the last Wednesday about the Chinese newspaper's advertisement in the Des Moines Register, which is the most widely sold newsmagazine in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States' throng elections that will take place on November 6th.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to get involved in the U.S. Congressional elections marked what official U.S. agents told Reuters’ news agency that there was a new stage in an increasing campaign from Washington to use China’s pressure.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertising to promote business, Beijing and Washington are engaged in ever - tough business wars, with new customs duties on both countries’ imports.
Chinese and American experts say that early in the business war, China’s payrolls were designed to harm displaced persons in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s replica class.
Terry Branstad, the ambassador of the United States of China and former governor of Iowa for the long time, but it carries out much of the agricultural goods to China, said that Peking had harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad, in writing, said in her article on Sunday’s Des Moines Register that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda messages in our own free media. ”
“By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of the United States’ and free media’s preferred language law by publishing the requested advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” said Branstad in his article.
“ On the other hand, a few protests can be found in newspapers on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the different views that China might have on the worrying economy of China, where the media are trapped under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest news reports in China came out of the invitation to publish ” his article, but he did not say which paper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters dismiss them for the mid-term reviews of the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - term reviews, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, who has accepted the accusation of sexual harassment.
Most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start a vote.
"These things cannot be backed up," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School, University of Syracuse, at The Hill, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was questioning the call for Jeff Flake, a senior officer of the Arizona Republic, in the last minute of an investigation by the FBI to calm down voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow and not November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Adviser and spokesman for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning the Protestants sang “November Approached ” when they protested the elders ’ walk when the repulsives who ruled the jury decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The interests and zeal of the electorate will go out of hand," said Stu Rothenberg, regardless of the political party, at the news section.
“ People will say that the interest has already been great, and it is true.
But he might be greater, especially for female voters in the suburbs and younger electors, 18-29 years old, who like the president, than rarely choose."
The analysts predicted a setback if the Republicans pressed for confirmation of Kavanaugh, even before Ford’s testimony, as she described her accusation of sexual assault from him.
“This is a big mess for the Republics group,” said Michael Still, former member of the Republics National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"The issue is not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, president of Priorities of the United States, a group helping to vote for Democrats, at the news station.
On the other hand, the United States seems to disagree who should believe after a witness from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a small majority supports the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents certainly believed, or likely believed, the witness from Ford, while 35 percent claimed to believe, or likely, Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations Ford made by at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, as reported by Guardian.
Ford testified to the ruling committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh wore his genitals in front of her when they were both at a party that attended Yale University in the 1990 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to set up a seed business to fight Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, open-ended Berners-Lee.
Solid enables users to choose where their data are stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that the intent behind Inrupt was “the Board of Governors.”
"We have to do this now," he said about the chipping company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data store ” or POD.
It includes a list of contacts, to-do lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal affluence by using data”.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt is the idea that the company provides access, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to all.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security firm purchased by IBM, a few programmers who were recruited as a contractor to work on the project, and a group of volunteers.
From this week onward, technology developers around the world may create their own independent software with tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not discuss “Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on their heads overnight.
"We don't ask them permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt had the aim of “creating energy in business and ecosystems that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new website based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee reorganized the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he is coming up inrupt.
"I am full of optimism for the next period of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victory priest and arrest from World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross during the first world war as a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Special Bernard Vann, who held the position of the military commander, received the cross on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, four days later, a shooter killed him, and he was never told that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
His two great sons exposed memories of him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great - grandfathers, Michael Vann, said that it was “beautiful figurative ” that the memorial was exposed exactly 100 years after his great - honoured grandfather.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his subsurgent army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin ditch “through a very thick fog and under a severe shooting from cannons and machine guns.”
Later, he ran to the line of fire, and with “great courage, ” he led the line forward before attacking one of his team’s cannons and overcoming three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only a month before the end of the war, a underpriest was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s heroes were “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a flower crane after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “a great privilege to take part in the parade ” and added that“ a pair of true heroes are shown with the support that so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, getting instead of seeing Gurra pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The program included 13 battle days from San Jose, six of them on the main program, and they were shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers were experiencing an unexpected event when the broadcast turned to Gurra Pigeon.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan at Twitter described the exchange to the child’s subject as “any kind of sick joke. ”
“In accordance with official rules, the material was not suitable for the audience at 6 a.m. so they had to switch to children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of the market and communications for Bellator, when he was asked to the broadcast.
"Gurre piggy, yes."
Scott Coker, director Bellator said they'd go over their time schedules and take the UK audiences into account in the future.
"I think when I think of the replay that we could probably solve this," Coker said.
“ But there is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we cannot solve this until Sunday in our time, which is a Monday for them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, many text messages were sent forward and back, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limit the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went too far.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “poor” because of sexuality
The Olympic dungeon Tom Daley claims to have felt inadequate toward other people in their upbringing because of their sexual orientation, but it encouraged him to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different ” until he went to high school.
On the radio program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his parent’s role diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the general manager, has taken several months off because of illness.
Daley showed up outside in Laverne's first part and said that he felt he was a "small man" but everyone else when he was a child because "it wasn't agreed in society to like both boys and girls."
“ Until today, ” he said, “these feelings of being inferior to me have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that at the end of the day, he would not be disappointed in his sexual appetite.
Two times the Olympic Fountain has been highly supported by LGBT, using its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legitimize homosexuality.
He said to be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The world’s champion three times said that becoming in love with the male American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013, “was“ a surprise to him. ”
Daley married his 20 - year - old Oscar winner, who said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much in your youth” - but he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “every way of life ” had been baffled.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize," he said.
“ Know what, there are more important things than gold prizes at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic Gold Award."
His son was baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, aged 40, after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not agreed that he would die, and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had received their tickets for London 2012 — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held my hand to him when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breathing stopped, and he was left to accept that he wasn’t invincible at last, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“I only knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dive in front of the audience at the Olympics’ home; it doesn’t feel any better, ” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song — Proud by Heather Small — who had inspired him to the Olympic Games and still gave him a goose bump.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in bad shape and he's been sitting on the bench in Ryder's cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will beat the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old beat so that he can't be rated surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the competition for the 12th time, has been put on the bench following the decision of President Jim Fury for the four-ball and four-game competitions on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the Hasar, as he has been so often before for the United States, the day of five times the Master alternates between being a cheerleader and practicing the plays on the field, hoping to correct what is bothering him.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot straight with the drone, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, since longing gloss often punishes for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf course is a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson must compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood in the team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below, take the first of 12 solo games, get a good start, Mickelson's game could change.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He completely understood the role he had today, clapped my back and took my arms and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furik.
“ He has great confidence.
He is in the hall of fame, and he has been so much replaced earlier this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but this ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo to the number of players in Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a process in the Ryder Cup, which has never achieved exactly as much success as other achievements on his file.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and 7 drawstrings, but Fury said that his presence had a vague effect on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcasm, he's polite, likes to make fun of people, and it's great to have him in the joint room," he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed teasing him, too, this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf."
Thomas Bjorn, President of Europe knows that a great deal of advance can quickly disappear
The European leader Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good start for the last day of the individual race in Ryder the cup can easily turn into uncomfortable experiences.
The Dane played first in Valderrama in 1997, where a side under the leadership of the head of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but reached the right to squeeze a victory at the end with a minimum score difference, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of head start in Valderrama, we had a lot of head start in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only just like that,” said Bjorn, who is shown here, after watching the 2018 vintage, working 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and reaching the lead 10-6 on the Le Golf Nationalvelt.
History will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't done.
We'll do our best tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This is not done until all the levels are on the tablet.
We have our goal, and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on it.
I've always said this, I focus on the players 12 in our team, but we're very aware of our opponents in the other team -- the best golfer in the world."
Bjorn was most pleased with the way his laymen had coped with a difficult situation and added: “I never go ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, it's the performance of the individuals that matters, and it's another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you play alone, you're trying on every man's talent as a golfer.
It is the message that must be sent to the playwrights, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his hostess, Jim Furik, will strive for his players to be better at individuality than at partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury himself has experienced both sides of this great transformation last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out “the miracle in Medinah. ”
“I remember every goddamn word,” he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the president in 1999, had encouraged his players on the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start quickly as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When it comes to building up, it causes a lot of pressure on the games that are in the center.
We arranged our players according to that and let them play as we think it will be best to go tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the game.
“I chose these players in this row because I think they’ll cover all the way through,” Bjorn said about their choice in the individual contest.
Germany’s New Armed Forces Relocated
The German Navy’s most recent warship should have been built in 2014 to replace an old warship from the Cold War period, but it will not be prepared until the next year, as reported in the area’s news, due to a breakdown of systems and an ever - increasing cost.
The building of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leader of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg team, has now been postponed until the previous half of 2019, according to the documents of the military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have been taken advantage of by the Navy in 2014, but a serious problem after its delivery.
The four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg crew that the Navy ordered in 2007 are to replace the Bremen-class ships that have reached their age.
They're supposed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a lot of air- and ship-to-air missiles, and hide technology like reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use times - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home port.
On the other hand, constant silence means that these latest - known warships enable Germans to demonstrate their strength at sea - to become obsolete when they are finally taken into account, says Die Zeit.
The F125 tanker got the news last year when the German army publicly refused to accept the floe and returned it to the Blohm & Voss release in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the manufacturer after the sale.
The reasons behind divorce were well - known, but many German media spoke of a woman’s serious “deficiency in software and hardware ” that would make the military useless if it was sent to an army.
Software failures were particularly important, as a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship will be operated by 120 crews, which are half less than on Bremen-class battleships.
It was also found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Navy to improve it in the future.
The 7,000 tons of ship 'Rheinland-Pfalz' is thought to be twice as heavy as a ship similar to that used by the Germans during World War II.
Except for the faults of machinery, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the vessel - is beginning to cause problems.
It is said that it reached EUR 3.1 billion (about $3.6 billion), but originally it had to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the most recent ships are particularly important in view of the warning that German superiority is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Military Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually becoming “a body with a capable ship.”
The representative said that the problem had occurred over time, for older ships were taken out of service, but no ships came in their place.
He lamented that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust Nature Conservation Association is spying on the secret life of bats
A new study on land in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Nature Conservation Association, will monitor different types of bats in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Specific recording devices will be installed at the key locations in the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather blades over the period.
Staff of NHS and volunteers will also be monitored by handheld sensors.
Experts will detect all recordings in order to find out the frequency and types of action of the bats.
Mapping of housing areas and reports will then be published to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS NT’s NT’s NT’s Nite June consultant, hopes that the results reveal what kind of habitat is most important to the bats and how they are used in each species.
This information will help determine the cost of farm management, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, bats have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are at risk because of construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitats.
Windmills and light can also lead to risks, including fly papers and certain materials, as well as domestic vehicle attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
On the other hand, their ears benefit much more than their eyes when they catch prey because they are used to hunting at night.
They used advanced rock - mining technology to locate insects and objects on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
In the organizations, ten experts who carry out regular examinations, nesting, and sometimes rescue activities work.
The organization has even set up the first and only bat country in Scotland at the Threeave ranch in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bats in Scotland are home.
David Thompson, a ranch overseer, says he is a perfect area for them.
"The area at Threeave is great for bats," he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of growing trees and plenty of good living areas.
But there is still a lot of ignorance about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand more fully what they need to work out."
He stressed the importance of checking bats prior to the maintenance of farms, since the possible accidental destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people and destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing, or destroying their nest is forbidden.
A Scottish representative at Bat Conservation Trust, Elisabeth Ferrell has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about bats, and we don’t know how many of their species are doing. ”
Ronaldo denies the accusation of rape when lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of ‘ false news’ rape, saying that people want to ‘ draw attention to themselves ’ by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus campaigners have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel’s report on Friday, he is said to have paid her $375,000 later for shutting down the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, said in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were “false news. ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
Ronaldos’ lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have called “an unacceptable display of private suspicion, ” according to Reuter’s news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand compensation for “the same amount and seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and the Las Vegas casino.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her in the rectum, according to documents submitted to the Clark County Council in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on her knees after an incident and told her that he was "99 percent good man" who had fallen into temptation because of the "one percent."
The papers argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that it had both approved.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and had her injuries taken in the hospital, but finally agreed to go outside the court's court because she was "afraid of revenge" and was concerned about becoming "depressed publicly."
She says she wants to stop the sweets because she's still in shock after an accident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when rape was supposed to take place, and in summer he went over to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would “see after eternity” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would ‘ regret it forever’ if it lost its position as an international leader among automobile manufacturers after Brexit, says Minister of Business Affairs Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK would have said to the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without agreement, the company would temporarily cease production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit without a contract would be a real job, the effect would be to delay our borders.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were moved to other European Union countries.
"It is believed that if Britain is going to shrink from the EU by the end of March, we will see the manufacturing plant in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about exit from the EU without agreement on how inter-country trade should be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that she will close her Mini factory in Oxford for the month after Brexit.
The main concern is that what car manufacturers say is a risk of imprisonment if Brexit without a contract becomes a reality.
The Toyota production line is based on reception at “the last hour”, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both the UK and the EU for vehicles manufactured after ordering.
In the absence of an agreement on 29 March, if the UK reduces its GDP, there may be disturbances at the national border which the industry considers could lead to loss of ownership.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than the daily stockbroker in its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the May Chequers programme for future relations with the EU 'has been specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border.'
"We must have a deal; we want to get the best deal that will enable us not only to enjoy success today but as an opportunity that we can make use of," he said on the BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very effective methods.
Toyota could not tell how long their production would be stopped, but for a long time, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a member of the trade union at the factory, said that his colleagues were ever more concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have presented an accurate and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU. ”
Finding between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, assistant state prosecutor, could be “re-released for about one week” now the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of the President’s justice.
For weeks history has been going on in Washington as to whether Trump will fire an assistant state prosecutor, thus endangering Mueller’s independence.
Earlier that month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a recording device to open a conversation with Trump and the possibility of rolling the president out of office using the 25th additional section of the government file.
Rosenstein refused these claims.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, among other things the news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump on Thursday, then he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would not like to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he was not at the same time as the audience of the Senate judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had charged him with sexual assault, witnessed both.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation of the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh, who postponed the vote even further.
Trump’s media representative, Sarah Sander, was broadcasting on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for him has not been set, it could be this week, and I think it may be postponed for a second week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always happy to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Captain Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not because of dissatisfaction with television reporters who had “visualism, ” but she said:“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have vision. ”
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
'The President answers more questions on the media than any other president has done before,' she said, without referring to the source: 'We have gone over these numbers.'
“ If the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, ” said Sanders, “it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it and you've seen us do a lot of the last few weeks and it'll replace a media meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown why in New York this week, when he showed himself to be a careless and strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU healthcare professionals in Scotland because of Brexit concern
The Minister of Health has written to staff from the EU who work within the health care system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express their gratitude for the nation and wish it to continue working after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to face costs due to job permits for EU citizens working within the public service sector.
Ms. Freeman wrote in his letter: “For the summer, discussions between the UK and the EU have continued on the basis of a decision and are expected to be decided in the fall.
The British Government has also prepared a contract if it is not possible.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I want to state again how much I value the work of all the employees, no matter what their nationality is.
Partners from the EU and elsewhere have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and provide benefits for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home, and we want you to stay here very much."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having had a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head injury in a 31-27 loss game against the team Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, as reported by Mike Organ, journalist Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury had happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," said Reed.
Practitioners and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on the shoulder and carried out for closer inspection.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, radio operator WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the injury yet ” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in senior school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had five totals on Saturday before he left, which raised his total number of hits to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamps when they buy real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamping fees when buying real estate in Britain. The excess will be used to assist the homeless, according to the new plan of the Maintenance Team
The operation will fail Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Raised stamps will be placed on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
A government fund estimated that it would raise 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged for higher stamping fees when they buy real estate in Britain. The excess will be used to assist the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to undo the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising housing at affordable prices and taxing more people of the capital.
Individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in Britain will have to pay higher stamps, and the excess will take action by the government to assist the homeless.
The increase - which is additional to current stamping dates, including the increase in extracurricular and real estate purchases for rent two years ago - could be up to three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will make up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreign partners, which increases prices and makes first - time purchases more difficult to get into the market.
Many rich areas in the country — especially in the capital city — have become “dream towns ” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamping plates to help other young people to have their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to withdraw from the homes at a disposal price to correct the "British Home Supply".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of notable renovations in housing, including the lease term and the end-of-day out of the rental house without cause.
He also wants to give more authority to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period — that each new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And it involves fixing our useless real estate market.
Britain's door will always open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right for foreign parties to be as easy as for companies with foreign headquarters to buy homes and for good British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own dwelling has become far too distant, and the shame of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to train Scotland'.
Jack Ross, coach of Sunderland, says that it is his “most important goal ” to become coach of Scotland at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is now taking advantage of the challenge of blowing new life at the North-East Club, which is now in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning to St. Mirren in the Scottish high school in the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was injured on my knee and so it was finished," said Ross in an interview with the Sports Sound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I did a good job of training the department."
The predecessors of Ross as trainers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic club said he felt no fear of following in footsteps such famous names at such a big club, but he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ Like this, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘ Can I get this club back into the finest section? ’
He said, "This club is definitely home in the high school because of its structure and situation."
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only look at me as a success here if I got the club back up there.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer after a period of training as an assistant coach for Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a training team for Hearts.
He helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and turned St Mirren, who was about to fall into a division, into the next season after.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he ever was in his playful career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
“ This was probably a real time meeting, ” he said about the period when he became Coach Alloa.
“ I really believed that my training was even more suitable than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, I had a decent income from it, and enjoyed a measure of success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I am still going through it as to stress and pressure from my work, but my training seems to be just right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do, I've never felt better with myself in all my adult years."
You can listen to the whole interview on the Sports Sound stage on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 at the British local time.
The best time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a poll
The heat surge in summer has proved to be beneficial for a British bar that has a gangbanger, but pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
The sales at pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s business consultant, who collected the figures, said: “The continued sun and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as June, when a battle increased by 2.8 percent, except for what a restaurant sold even less.
Salan fell about 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and got worse again in July.
Puppets and bars, which mainly sell alcoholic beverages, were best placed with a larger buoyancy during the downturn of the restaurant.
There were also difficulties in the sun for the sellers of food, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
There was an increase of 6.6% in the amount of beer to be marketed in the puppies and in the children before the month, but a reduction in food sales was three percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results remain on the swing we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to selling in an out - of - house market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still experiencing difficulties, although selling up to 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful over the continuation of cost-induced pressure.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time before the grocery store and only time will reveal whether to temper the temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
The total sales volume in the puppies and restaurants, including those in newly opened places, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowness of openings.

One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, up to 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in 'genuine Insta' pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students claim to have a 'primary' account they show parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, makes secret accounts of social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in the 'real Insta' accounts - which is a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “primary ” account to show parents, as well as having a secret bill.
One mother, who was on the secret website of her 13 - year - old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to “encourage me. ”
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, showed that 40 percent of children 11-18 years of age had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having a secret bill.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It is a concern that so many youths are tempted to create an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be “the voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Elidh Doyle has been elected as chairman of the Scottish Athletics Committee without executive authority at the annual general meeting of the government.
Doyle is the most successful freelance woman in Scotland and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field in the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get it to the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking for athletes and hope that I can do my part and help to continue my sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who won among the 100 - foot [200 m] and 400 - meter [400 m] races at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, while a total of four Olympic gold, now enjoying regular guests at the BBC, was paralysed after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I was OK and then how much.
This has been hard work, but I got used to it, learned to walk again, and do sports today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
Breast pumping auger, which compares mothers to cows, results in an online disparity
Enterprises producing breast pump are now listed on the Internet because of advertising that carries lactating mothers with lactating cows.
The company Elvie published an ad to highlight what is said to be “the world’s first portable breast pump. ” The ad is inspired by musical videos and should show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who are breast - feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cuddle with lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see any tails on me" and, "If you didn't notice it, it's not a moat, it's my breasts."
The supplement continues: “Pumpa, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, pump milk from the July. ”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has caused online publicity.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video has had a variety of reactions from the audience, many of whom say that it had “the horror ” of the dairy industry.
“Really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they have to be drunk and bear to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born," said one of the comments.
The Elvie breast pump fits comfortably in the breast-feeding holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “Really difficult for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of date. ”
Others came to the defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that it would be “disciplined. ”
“ I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
It's brilliant," wrote one of the audience.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement, which is aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside a toilet) and feels like “hum. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say they feel like cows when they pump milk out of them.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or wires and fits comfortably into the chestguard, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and head of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that it deserved a prominent presentation that would trigger a talk.
By likening women to cows, we wanted to focus the spotlight on breast - pumping and all her challenges, even showing in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been reported.
During the fashion week in London, two of the children of a mother presented a fashion show to designer Martha Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants quietly moved to a camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has suddenly increased even though the number of those crossing the border each month has remained somewhat the same, the reason being that the hard language and policy put forward by the government of Trump has made it harder for the children to be in temporary abortion.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered with immigrants themselves, and they have been afraid to put their chances of remaining in the country at risk by offering themselves to feed a child.
The risk was increased in June, when the government announced that potential foster parents and other adults in the home had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authority.
Last week Matthew Albence, the head of immigration and customs, witnessed before the elders and said that his organization had arrested a number of people who applied to feed single children.
The foundation later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in the home of foster children are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
'That's why we keep looking for them,' said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the handling of the children’s affairs, representatives reported on new rules requiring some of the children to appear in a courtroom within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was former standards, according to employees working in the event.
Many of them will come through a video meeting, rather than in person, to argue for their legal position before judges in immigration matters.
The children who are judged unfit for entry into the country are quickly sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or escape attempts, according to the workers of the shelters and reports published by the system in recent months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely to occur in a larger institution, such as Tornillo, where it is likely that no one will notice that a child is difficult because of the number of them.
They added that the move of the children to the city would not allow enough time to prepare them spiritually or to greet friends could add to the shock that many of them are already struggling.
Syria says that the US, France and Turkey will immediately withdraw
Mr Walid al-Moualem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, also said in his speech at the General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also played the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem firmly stated that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we clear all the Syrian territories ” of both terrorist groups and“ all illegal foreign parties. ”
The United States has about 2000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough for them to return and taught “some Western countries ” to“ spread out a senseless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on international society and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“They make politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the resistance to end the war.
Erindrikar S.D. says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area at the last major battlefield created the opportunity to continue political conversation.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a great deal of attacks from being waged by the Syrian troops of Russia, the region where three million people live.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the agreement had a 'clear final release' and expressed the hope that military operations would be directed towards the jihadists, including those from the Nusra Front, associated with Al-Qaeda, and that 'they would be exterminated'.
Mr Staffan de Mistura, Ambassador of the United States, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition, to prepare a constitution for Syria after the war and to pay the street for elections.
Moualem stated that her work should be limited to “overseeing the current government’s rules, ” warning all interventions.
Reasons for Trump to win another election period
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the reviews in 2020, except for the charges and scandals that put an end to his president's career, as many liberals probably hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a president ever! ”
As it is, the audience has no signs of fatigue.
From 2014 onwards, the best-time perspective has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and nearly triples to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million spectators four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the share of MSNBC, The Rachel Maddow Show, has peaked with up to 3.5 million spectators on important news reports.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of ABC's designated Survivor dramatist about a government employee who will be president after the Assembly Hall is destroyed.
Nell Scovell, an experienced columnist and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another suggestion.
She remembers going in a taxi in Boston for the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’ ” said Miss Scovell to me.
There's an entertainment value in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on TV, Washington’s stories could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can unite and health the global economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at a group of experts at the sixth time using Bob Woodwards on the “very close” sources for his book “Fear,” or a $15,000 jacket made of ostrich leather that Paul Manafort wore (“a garment that is bred with pride,” said Washington Post) and the consequences of accurate biologic descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never look Super Mario the same way again.
“The end of what he does and makes you feel this is like a reality factor, is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, managing director Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the “Pawn Stars”, discussing the field of work in Trump’s exhibition and the daily changes in the narrative (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and commending Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one thing, or you're gonna lose the strings.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss, there were 26 degrees of heat and sunlight outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and looked at MSN while he took up CNN.
He could not disfellowship himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were creating all these crazy things in the old days, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money Outflows in the Nearest Elections of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing to it, thanks to the reorganization of fields that led two representatives to compete for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area will present the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another selection area in special elections last summer.
Lamb offers himself against other representatives, the representative of Keith Rothfus, who is now a representative of the old 12th selection area in Pennsylvania, which is very close to the new 17th selection.
The maps of the chosen areas were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old electoral districts were organized for the sake of the Republics and that they violate the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th election area has been launched to compete in the campaign between the main investors of both classes, the Democratic Committee on Elections (DCCC) and the Committee on Elections (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a special election in March of the 18th elections in Pennsylvania, but many were followed by that election.
The Republicans had previously spoiled it for more than a decade, and Donald Trump, President, won the election with a 20 - degree difference.
Political experts have given some lead to democratism.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support of China, but then it stopped.
Kingdom Drunkers noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners ran away the management team of Trump.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “new decisions to accept the Teavan no longer, ” said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Council in an early announcement.
However, punishments were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received USD 140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic support.
The sanctions imposed and imposed, among other things, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where there is a high level of unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, the United States and Central American representatives postponed the Security and Economic Progress Conference and were scheduled to follow a similar meeting held in the past and considered to be a step forward in measures to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, in the middle of September, representatives from the upper ranks made it clear that they wanted the convention to be held, and as a result, they ended all mischievous acts of punishment against El Salvador.
Vice - President Mike Pence is now to address the conference to be held in the middle of October, as a symbol of the importance it is in the eyes of the government.
The three American ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new strong message or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss in more detail what three American representatives described, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the internal debate against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter against anonymity.
Learn History
The next scandal could be the report by Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, on possible measures by Mr. Trump to prevent justice, but for that accusation there are numerous official evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turned his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign of election worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the assembly is controlled by another category, Trump may need to bear responsibility for it, at the time he prepares to meet his constituents again, and perhaps his fellow members' abdominal disease.
However, this is very uncertain, and I do not want to insist that Trump's fall is clear, nor that his colleague in Europe falls.
We all need to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German rulers were prepared to rob Hitler of power, only if Western countries had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the calamities that followed.
History revolves around such important points and speeds up or slows down the unstoppable course of democracy.
The United States is facing such an important point now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a state prosecutor named Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had suggested making secret recordings of the president and discussing whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI at Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the mid-term that will allow Mr. Trump to assume responsibility?
If we pass these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and was formerly assigned to my missionary home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the hashboard.
With such an inheritance, how can I look beyond our positive eyes to our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers teammate, optimism for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will give them a strong position to get out of the European Union's G-group. Rangers made a great match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing his first game at the time before the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2-2 draw, but he thinks Rangers can use it as a jumpboard for better results.
“It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could reach something and end up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have claimed victory at the end, but overall, a tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game, and we got strong into the second half of the game and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Union.
I hope we can reach three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job last time, but with those who support us, I'm sure we're going to make it through this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling at the place.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves. Training is good.
I hope we can go further now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of losing pension savings
Even though participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they talked to their mate about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children.
“People want family members to do it, but it doesn’t take the right step to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalwide’s Life Insurance Department.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes clear to them with good warnings.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you receive care, as these options can change greatly in terms of expenses.
Ask your financial adviser: Your adviser may also help you to find ways to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are long-term life insurance, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay expenses, or self-assurance with your own money--as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get your healthcare provider so that you can nominate someone you trust to supervise your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals respond to your wishes if you cannot directly express them yourself.
Think, too, about obtaining a source of produce for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is going to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and hypersensitivity?
Please enter the details in the written schedule so that you are ready.
“It’s not only about finance, but also about who the doctors are,” said Martin.
“Who are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Get that plan ready."

The victim was a man in his 50 ’ s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the abdomen, and the hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as “an arbitrary attack. ”
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not hurt for life, and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Flood Waves in Indonesia
At least 384 people left their lives behind a powerful earthquake and a flood in the Indian city of Palau on Friday, said delegates, and it is expected that the dead will rise.
Since all communication lies below, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from the Donggala County, a region north of Pala, located near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left their homes in Palah after disaster broke out.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu, the capital of the Central Sudanese region, is located at the bottom of a narrow flood on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40 - year anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area that covers more than 300 miles [380 km] of shoreline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is a regional government, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of employment in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach in the face of Sulawesi.
Flood waves have flooded both Pala and Donggala several times in the past century, according to Indonesia’s disaster organization.
In 1938 more than 200 people died when a flood struck and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
Also, in 1996, a flood on the western part of Donggala, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the active continent of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the main earthquakes and flood waves in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the western coast of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra raged over December 26th and started a flood wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the shoreline of the Indian Ocean, of which there were over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A row of strong tremors crossed the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds die on Nias Island, out of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake reached 6.8 on the Richter River, across the southern part of Jöva, Indonesia’s most populous island, and caused a flood that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake reached 7.6 on the Richter River, which is near the city of Padang, a capital city in the western part of Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake reached 7.5 on Richter, riding over one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to ten meters [10 m] of flood waves that destroyed a number of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: The foundation of the earthquake raged over the Pidie Jaya County of Aceh and caused destruction and persecution as people recalled the destruction in the deadly earthquakes and flood waves in 2004.
This time no flood was formed, but over 100 died when buildings collapsed.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and over 500 people were killed, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of travelers were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former head of state of Alaska and president of the government, has been arrested for assaulting the body.
The 29 - year - old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to prevent the announcement of domestic violence and to resist arrest, as reported by the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report a alleged crime.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su station where he is waiting for his hearing before the court, and he is being held against a $500 guarantee, according to a report from KTUU.
On Saturday, when he declared that he was “not guilty, by no means ” when he was asked to declare guilt or innocence, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three A - class crimes, which means that he could be sentenced in prison for up to one year and would have to pay $250,000 in fine.
He has also been charged with crimes of class B, punishable by one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The issue is now being discussed for the Alaskan surrender court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing the notification of domestic violence, and of carrying alcohol-induced weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of military service in 2016 after she taught a distressing disorder about his son’s violent behavior, after his military service in Iraq.
The earthquake and the flood in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on Friday over the Indonesian island of Sulawes.
The 7.5 - foot earthquake on Richter started a flood wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are down and are expected to be more pronounced in the next few days.
The earthquake got right in the middle of Sulawesi Island, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident occurred are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palah when the wave of the flood struck the beach.
Suspects seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
New York City prosecutors want a death penalty against Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having taken part in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, which is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for crimes against federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have taken a Home Depot truck hire to attack people on a bike ride along the West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan. He drove down there walking and riding roadways in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “wildly ” and caused serious physical injuries“ intentionally, ” according to the New York City Republic death warrant.
Both of these defendants can lead to possible death penalty, as stated in the caselaw.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal sentence was brought against 22 members, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, usually used by prosecutors in prosecution of organized crime organizations, and Saipov was also charged with violent crime and for destroying the car.
The attack involved “a remarkable plan of action” and described Sapiov’s actions as “abominable, cruel, and immoral. ”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov suffered physical injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the Declaration of Will.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since New York’s southern part of the country last resort to the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were killed after being convicted for spying on the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of the days and months after the attack, according to legal documents.
He told a detective that he was comfortable with what he had done, said a police officer.
Saipov told the authorities that he had got the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, said a police officer.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 cases.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said that they were “of course disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to ask for death penalty instead of agreeing to a life-time detention declaration without the possibility of a probationary period will only prolong the event due to this event for all the party-owner,” said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the execution of the death penalty.
A member of the council says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “act armies of the people ” today at protests at a conference of conservatives.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians would have to “get under pressure ” from EU skeptics, at the same time as one of Theresa May’s members suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
At the Birmingham protest march, maintainer Peter Bone said that if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit, Britain would “go out. ”
However, the challenge facing May to settle a deep disagreement between her own teammates became even more apparent when maintenance workers, who wish to remain in the EU, participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers programme on track and is being criticized by those who are obedient to Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that they will continue to fight to reach agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and force those opposed to Brexit and the Workers' Party to choose between her plan and 'unease'.
Mr. Bone told the Lady Means Leaf protest march in Solihull that he wanted to ‘get rid of the Chequers plan. ’
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been involved and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we would have gone out now,” he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight to serve others during world wars.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone referred to indications that public opinion had changed from the 2016 elections: “The idea that the British public has changed their opinion and wants to stay is completely untrue. ”
Andrea Jenkens, a conservative supporter of Brexit, was also in the protest march and told the reporters: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote for it, and it enjoys unpopularity among our team members and activists who are on the streets and choose us.
Do it, stop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In her direct messages to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their work when they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to be “found under pressure ” if they were to deviate from the decision that was made following the vote in 2016.
“ This is now about trust between our people and our political group, ” he said.
"They want to try to betray Brexit and we're here together today to say to them, "We won't let you get away with this."
He added in his messages to the crowd: “I want you to feel pressure from your political group, who is being deceived by Brexit.
We activate the army of the public in this country that won us in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city centre.
After the group was set up this weekend, a small group of operatives waved the flags against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Workers ’ Group, made fun of keepers because of security problems that arose in the group’s phone program when the convention was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems okay and all the technology for Canada plus, for borderline without obstacles, for free trade with Ireland without border," he added.
“ This is a total scandal.
There's nothing that can be called good Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to "consider seriously" to present himself to the president.
According to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, following the November election, he says: “Contemplating a serious presentation to the office of President. ”
According to a report from Boston Globe, the Massachusetts democrat discussed his future at a civil meeting in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized Donald Trump U.S. President, is presenting himself to a election in November against the representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-managing in Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been the focus of the problem that it could present itself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her district, since Trump took office.
One attending the meeting asked her if she wanted to present herself to the president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and work our government, and a woman as a leader is also needed. ”
Arresting following a deadly shooting on Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the LSU basketball player's Wayde Sims case, but he was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported an arrest at Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for assistance in identifying a person who was seen on the recording.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the Southern University University university early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head and died because of it," said Murphy J. Paul, police officer, at the press on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to have been on the scene, with weapons in his march, and admitted to having shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trouble and was detained in the eastern Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two feet tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played 32 games, of which 10 in the starting team in the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and achieved 2.9 outcomes each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat after an order from their team.
It was evident from the fact that Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before launch on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes would play a major part in the competition.
Boths got a good start at the start and nearly left Hamilton as he held his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pit and had Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been possible to resolve.
The Mercedes car went to the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out of a short fight where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after being at risk of being left, after defense attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started in the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first ring, on his 21 - year - old birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he postponed the change of tires to try to finish quickly and move ahead of Kimi Raikkonen and reach fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th ring but could not increase the rate in the eight remaining rings, and Raikkonen took the fourth seat.
This is a difficult day, because Valtteri stood by all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me through.
The team has been amazingly successful," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body expression.
Donald Trump, U.S. president of the United States, laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, claiming that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with an accusation against Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, about sexual assault.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony to the Committee of Elders’ Committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untrue.”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the elders, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and cruel and untrue, ” he said.
“ When you see the releases and leaks, and then you say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick this?
Remember her answer... you lashed the document - “Oh, ha, what?
Oh, no.
I don't paint it."
Now, wait a minute.
Let's... no, we didn't do it," he said and copied the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges from Ford against Kavanaugh were made, and it was leaked early in September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't explain her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as she asked me to. ”
But her denial did not seem to go well in the president, who said at the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, this was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't paint anything, but this was the worst body expression I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and insisted that democrats should take advantage of their accusations.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods are needed.
You see the cruelty, the evil, the no matter who they hurt, who they must choose over to gain power and control," said the President, according to the report from Mediaite.

Air traffic controller takes life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape from an earthquake
A flight manager in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off the air safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missed after a great earthquake broke over the island of Sulawes on Friday, and a flood wave followed.
Large aftershocks continue to plague the area, and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Palau.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the control tower that moved violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake was over, could surely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
Later, he died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision saved hundreds of lives, as reported by ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
The authorities fear that the dead may speak more than a thousand, when the National Emergency Office says that access is restricted to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“The figure is that the number of deaths is still increasing because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Agency.
Up to six feet [6 m] high waves have caused tremendous destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
The military and the passenger aircraft are working to provide relief equipment and supplies.
In an interview with Sky News, 35 - year - old Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said: “Every minute a ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesia Red Cross strives to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it might get worse."
Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and told the army of the country: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation - related tasks.
Are you ready?" said a CNN report.
Earlier this year, earthquakes hit the Lombok in Indonesia, where over 550 people died.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini is now said to be missing after the plane crashed into the loon
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a loon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that from Saturday afternoon on, it did not know about the outcome of a male passenger.
The airline claimed to work with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land on the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what precise sequence of incidents.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said both that the plane had landed in the loon just before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the approach was very low.
"It was really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could wade the water in the middle and find emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the Air Forces were afraid and crying and that he had suffered minor head injury.
The Navy of the United States said that sailors who were working a short time away from making a dock also helped in the rescue by using an bloated boat to carry people ashore, before the plane sank some 30 feet [30 m] of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in the crash of PNG-registered aircraft in the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutors closed their case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as a specialist in information analysis.
He described how he used cell records to assemble the defendant’s 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers' night of death, on the contrary, on his previous statements, according to the report of The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, a police officer went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only been known for one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted text messages, calls, and her contact details from his phone.
"He destroyed her from her life," said Hale.
It is estimated that the defenders will bring their final address on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the matter to be settled later that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop hop?
A hip trio wants to fight against negative regard for the music by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hops were removed from their origins where they contained political messages and discussed social issues.
They want to look for the source again and make consciously hip hops popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent upswing in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny in New York, a couple's attorney for expulsion following a 'prejudiced' text message
Nanny in New York is a lawyer for an illegal expulsion after she received an unannounced mother’s text message complaining that she was “another black person. ”
So the couple refuse to be prejudiced, and they liken the prosecution to “excitation. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new foster, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for work the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEEEIIIII OTHERS ANSWERS TO MANNIGHT” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Ms. Maurice.
After discovering their mistake, Ms. Maurice, a former nurse who was black, ran a “old-fashioned” Plasco-Flaxman, and said that she had expected a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants compensation for the removal, that a sum of $350 a day for the six - month job she had originally contracted, even though no contract was signed.
"I wanted to show them that you shouldn't do this," she said in an interview with Post on Friday and added, "I know this is a difference."
The couple objected to their accusations that they were prejudiced, saying that it was right to run Maurice, for they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her a message that she was not going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children to someone after showing this rudeness, even if it was a surprise?
His newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened his application to a “trafficking,” saying that his wife had arrived seven months on the way and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this state?
It's not very nice," said Plasco, who works at the investment hall.
The case is still in court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on the social media and shamed them for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would find it difficult to share with a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to follow someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"It's very funny now that we know of the tremendous success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC taker before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy bear, had taken away his work with a calm positive attitude, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was “good - for - nothing ” after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which she describes as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father had quietly shown pride in his ultimate success.
“He was a very quiet man and was not accustomed to brag, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you had a child who does something, you’re proud of it even if you didn’t do something yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Though Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the honor."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
"Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Later, Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep the heart beat up were gradually losing their activity and getting out of the body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn’t sing or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned his dead daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers who knew none of the difficulties she experienced.
"No one knew anything," she said.
“ I drank my head, and tears fell all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight, I felt deep sympathy for Nad.
That he would need my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get assistance.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day, ” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he was “sucking down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I keep worrying that there will be a aftermath. ”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit down and say nothing - you need to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Miss Davies' age, lost his spouse Mark to 15 years of age shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about his suffering or being depressed or anything like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death would be a shock to them, but they would have to work out: “This will tear a hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on a thread when the FBI has researched
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a limited study of time and scope — maybe we could achieve a little agreement,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was “to be broken” in the middle of a conflict between the groups where everything was in the backlash.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their silence is because of their timing.
In just five weeks, on November 6, the mid - term reviews are in progress, and if Republicans fail, as is expected, their serious efforts to get their fellow man elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the country are weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was the secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its research report?
A vote will be taken at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting at the same time.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the Electoral Department, but it would enable the Vice - President Mike Pence to break the balance and confirm him in the office of Supreme Court Judge.
Number of those fleeing North Korea “reduces” under Kim’s command
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un arrived in power seven years ago, according to a South Korean congressman.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from the South-Korea Cooperation Council and said that 1127 people had fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that a stronger border fence between North Korea and China and higher charges charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official declaration.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive South Korean civil rights.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 people from North Korea have gone illegally across the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border of North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than the neutral area between North and South Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often forcing them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have technically improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks mainly on delayed nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between Donald Trump, President of the United States, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in a row towards a nuclear-free Korean crisis.
On Saturday, however, the U.S. Secretary of State of North Korea Ri Yong Ho taught the American commercial prayers for lack of progress since then.
'Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country's security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons one side first,' said Ri in his speech at the General Assembly of the New York State.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh 'the mother's disease' and said he was incapable of performing the work of Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in Congress, called Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge “the mother - in - law ” and told him too much courage to work in Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those words fall on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease,” said Pelosi about her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the committee of elders on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied with a deep feeling that he had been sexually harassed by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both youths.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and he sometimes cried out and had a cake in his throat as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned democrats in the committee and called upon him the accusations of “abominable and organized murder ” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial toward the Democrats.
"I believe that these statements and how he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats show that he is unfit for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh expelled from work if he is confirmed and if Democrats reach the majority at Congress.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unfit to be in Supreme Court, but also in court as he is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge in the appeal court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decision of Kavanaughs against the medical law enforcement of the Affordable Care Act or the abortion of Roe v. Wade, where he is thought to be a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh wondered if he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for the motherly sick, a partisan person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘It is wonderful!’ ” said Pelosi.
And women need to take advantage of it.
These are righteous words, months, and years of fierce flow out of them, so they do not come forth without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, but you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also wept when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories of my former job that I had in my office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of the rage that I couldn't express, came an older woman and took into the head trauma of me. She was a cold boss who I had always feared a little and she dragged me into the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think that you are sad and rejoice at having entered into you."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was in the president's office, but she was then a congressman of the Democratic Party of Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured with a passion for aboard a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his presentation, Ms. Schroeder, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“It wasn’t a well - planned decision, ” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name "Melly White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign had gone a long way, she was following in terms of funding, so she promised not to go forward unless she managed to raise $2 million.
There was a lost fight.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m going to get a discount? ” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overcome with emotion--thank you for the people who had supported her, resentment toward the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct her eyes to the electors instead of the representatives, and anger into the gender discrimination--that she burst into tears.
"It could have been thought that I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, recalling how the media reacted.
“ Kleenex might seem to be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
The reason why business wars between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the business war between the United States and China were raging, and although the war is far from over, the gap between the countries could be favourable for Beijing for a long time, say experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s main export goods, including solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
This week, the highest rate of inflation came with new customs duties that cover goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Peking has answered in the same coin each time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent tax on American goods at $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States’ tax - tax system, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will be released in the near future.
To get Washington to hop, it would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China to take a public stand against the United States.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps the cards right, customer pressure from the US business war could have a positive effect on China for a long time, reducing the mutual need for both economies.
“The fact that an accelerated political decision in either Washington or Beijing could lead to the situation that leads to the economic downturn in one country is actually much more dangerous than the audience has previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, an investigator who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syrian 'ready' for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country willingly, seeking help to rebuild the land, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Mr. Walid al Moualem, a foreign minister, spoke at the UN General Assembly and said that conditions in the country improved.
“Today the conditions on earth are more stable and secure, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to operate in normal situations by building up areas destroyed by terrorists.
All of this is ready for refugees to return willingly to the land they were forced to leave because of terrorist acts and unilateral economic decisions that countered their daily lives and jobs.
IT IS estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept assistance on the grounds of conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Union has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States with the final result 16.5 versus 10.5 points on the Le Golf National Field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on a European basis and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when, under the leadership of President Thomas Bjorn, it reached 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was in difficulty most of the race, struck his initial strike into the 16th hole, which is par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and made 1 out of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the race started using its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5/4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was in the lowest place in the European team’s order.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers of the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England who played the possible in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times around the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player in the 25th race.
“ On the contrary, I’m not crying, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," said Emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He marched his country to the John Rahm tortoise, but he won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a solo game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have conquered Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the competition around Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard weekend finding themselves in the field, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The U.S. president, Jim Furik, said of disappointment with his team, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take it from Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the United States, and the Committee on Ryder, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take it from above.
They played better than us."
