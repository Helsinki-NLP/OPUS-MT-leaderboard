Biker reacts with lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured due to his quick reaction.
Driver oversees Biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to take her VW from Merklingen to the country road in 1230 towards Machtolsheim.
She oversaw the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away at the collision
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but it was at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the strip operation, the hand lever and the foot brake lever were demolished on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Presently, he controlled his motorcycle in the green tops next to the road and let it roll out there without falling to the ground.
Biker suffers leg injury
Through the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury at the Beis and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavaria Mamming, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service is monitoring the selection.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive on the Corona-Ergen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, unfortunately, we have to take this step to protect the population," said Werner Bumeder Landrat (CSU).
Seven employees had previously been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for insoles.
Mamming is a rural municipality with over 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of persons".
In the yard infected by uninfected employees, the grounds are now surrounded by a fence.
Green and SPD gave co-responsibility to the government.
The two opposition fractions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitter if such local infections have to be tackled and regional lockdowns organized," said Jürgen Mistol, Parliamentary Managing Director of the Greens.
This is very similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be carefully monitored from our point of view.
This obviously didn't happen".
The outbreak had come with an "answer".
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-olds fall into the trackbed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at Aidenbachstraße U-Bahnhof, a 19-year-old fell by a pusher and slipped into the trackbed.

According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
Persons from the 17-year-old group helped the crashed climb out of the track.
There was no danger due to a running track.
As reported by the police, there were then again conflicts between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled the scene of the crime, but his personnel could be determined in retrospect.
He went with his father to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-olds are diagnosed with body injury.
Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage of data
The stock storage is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period following a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data for the media - instead of the ten weeks planned for half a year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick change of law in a letter.
Seehofer thus intends to strengthen measures to combat child abuse.
He felt it would be useful "to make the necessary adjustments to the law already now," the paper quotes from the letter.
At present, the stock data storage is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected to do so.
However, Mr Seehofer wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report goes on to say.
A spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice said that it was only possible to consider whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already spoken out in June for data storage.
NBA: Strip club anger for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to the U.S. media reports, however, he visited the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who should have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in Isolation, is being tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, note R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season to the end.
At present, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting at night on Friday.
Soder expresses itself after mass infection to the Corona situation
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) announced on Sunday a tea table for large farms.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has startled authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working, over a third of them are infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a building fence.
No one should leave the premises, food supply.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the well-known 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, so far the Land Council assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Knowledge": Confession by Nantes' suspected arsonist
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He greatly regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "poured by conscience and very much taken away from the extent of destruction".
In the case of a conviction, according to the prosecutor, the man is threatened by ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire on Saturday of last week.
The fire had broken out in the church at three distant places.
Laboratory investigations hardened suspicion of arson.
The suspect now in custody had been arrested just a few hours after the fire.
But he was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent entry into the church, he quickly came to the attention of the investigators.
Discussion on abolishing the 50+1 rule
The former President of the DFB Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel of the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work at all for the clubs that can become dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
To this end, the debate is not about whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that wish to break into this Phalanx."
However, he has doubts as to whether the German football league is prepared to allow majority participation which is prohibited by the 50+1 rules in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Federalliga economic location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "at the end of the day attempts to achieve more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and went through the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That's been very busy to me human."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian operative.
"I have committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"I have dealt with the ominous watch gift completely transparent and ardently.
Many in the DFB knew about this".
He never made a "heel out of the present," assured the 58-year-old.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
Black Lives Matter: Injured and Dead
The protests against police force in the United States have been retorted by Donald Trump's use of federal policemen in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between demonstrators and policemen in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin a person was killed by shots while a demonstration train just crossed a crossing.
Before that, protests against racism and police violence had once again collapsed in Portland.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas during the night and violently drove demonstrators apart.
Hundreds of armed demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday and demanded that the authorities responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot at a drug raid in her home in Louisville in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, when a member of a group who calls himself an armed alliance of black Americans gave a shot, three people were injured.
According to the NBC station, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of death.
The police set up barricades because area protesters of a white militia had also formed.
At a meeting between the two groups, it did not finally happen.
In Texas Austin, a person was shot and killed in the process of a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was put in custody.
She has not yet made any further details of the circumstances of the act.

Investigations have been made.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defiant Corona
Although the large sauce in the spa town was missing, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy Weekend without Rakoczy Fest.
But: Although the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the masses of people and program highlights like Saale, Rakoczy Ball or Festzug, many of the Corona-compliant alternative program came to their expense.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, while the historical were in the focus of the festival alone.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting with her husband for more than 25 years for the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple made it comfortable at the Luitpold-Casino, observed the historical while flaning and listened to the Cuban live music at the game bank restaurant.
"I like it so much," says Konhäuser.
She doesn't miss the people who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But you are missing the usual program highlights, first and foremost Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic celebration and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Tournament is scheduled to take place again
For the actors of the historical guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
About for Christina Gold, who takes part in a normal year's ceremony and is there on the carriage of the Kurgarten café.
This year she was traveling on Saturdays and Sundays in Costume on foot in the city.
"It's already more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The Reiterverein had less to do, even if individual riders were on their way to the park.
"We very much hope that the horseradish will be held again in the coming year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy tournament should be held again.
28 Corona Falls in Fuenlabrada, Spain
The Spanish second football player CF Fuenlabrada is becoming increasingly deeply involved in the crisis because of a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid had flown to the city of A Coruña on July 20 despite the first cases of Corona, the next one follows a downstroke.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the town of the same name southwest of Madrid had so far still the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled in the last moment, the prosecutor's office determined because of a possible crime against public health, the highest sports department CSD considers the forced descent of the club.
Players and other team members are sitting in a hotel in quarantine.
"Up to the sixth day of the quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel and no gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
On photos you can see how players would have hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem was eating.
Neither was it good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club manager, on the other hand, told us that you are satisfied with the hotel.
The allegation of deliberately endangering public health was rebutted by the club’s lawyer Javier Tebas Llanas.
The Spanish Primera Division's son Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca", was not in violation of the Corona rules set up by the football association.
Before the departure, there had been four infected persons until July 19, but all of them had been isolated and had not been involved.
All players and team members were tested again immediately before the flight to A Coruña on Monday.
When the team was already in A Coruña, it would have been positive for "five or six" team members of the Corona test.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before the attack, said Tebas Llanas.
Police have to catch horses torn out at steam.
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 o'clock, a road operator told two free-running horses on the carrier between the mouth of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway connection station Theres.
At the time of the arrival of the officials, the horses were already again between the porter and the village of Steamach.
After the officers gained the confidence of the horses shortly before steaming, they were able to change a rope carried in the truck.
Radprofi Tony Martin: Career-continued imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just finishing up with the team's conditions, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Generale Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
In the negotiations with his team it was also about the number of racing days," he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been, "Quickly back on the wheel.
Today I think as the father of a little daughter: what if?"
The wheel pro admitted that there were certainly aspects with which he was increasingly struggling.
"But it was good for me to remember from the time of the Corona, what I am doing on cycling and how much fun he is doing to me."
The time travel specialist will return to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets on the weekend

Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - With his new Club AS Monaco, Niko Kovac will soon have a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French master will host the Hessen, the former club of the Croatian on August 1 (18:00).
For the Bundesligists, it is the first and only hard test before replaying in the Europe League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is carried out without viewers.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
Sporty is this an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Prior to his change to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-ranking opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had taken up the succession of the Croat at the time of accession.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eighth-final hin game against Basel at its own stadium at 0:3.
Nearly 50 New Infections: Landkreis Hof barely past the lockdown
In the Hof district, the number of known new Corona infections increased further on weekends: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is cured and no longer falls into these statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
There is also a case in the town of Hof.
Thus, the room nears the courtyard of the critical brand of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 dead by monsoons in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Because of the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people died.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent tries to reach the isolated people in boats.
All villages are under water.
Farmers have lost their crops.
Pannes horns in National Park die by Erdrutsche
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 Panzerna horns died from landslides.
They are protected and valid as endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which brings knowledge into focus on climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 by the floods displaced.
So far, only a few people have moved in.
It is difficult to bring the people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also persists in Grenezn.
Those who once had a house, it was also so small and similar to a cottage, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block of housing.
Many apartments are empty, but should - as the government wants it - soon be taken from those who have lost their house through the floods.

Argentina refuses counter offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"It would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private creditors to waive part of its claims of approximately US$66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is once again threatened by the state.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Finally, the creditors had requested higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government maintains its last offer and is not prepared for any further concessions.
Argentina is experiencing a serious financial and economic crisis.
Inflation was last more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect about ten percent of the economy to decline.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet US$503 million interest receivables and was therefore ousted into a limited default in payment.
Professionally arrived - not yet private
"It runs super good" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will take up the succession of Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden Notariatsstelle.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral doctoral thesis took up the work, the normal daily business is long on full tours.
"However, I still have to arrive private," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Advertiser and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time had not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg.
At least her husband was still able to apply for a short-term parenting period in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, they also have a possibility of staying with their parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring country circle, of course, the city of Eggenfelden has long been a term to her.
When she visited her family in the past few months, she said recently: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection procedure for free.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role: After the Jura degree in Passau, she completed her reference period and the second state degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, including Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at this time she also trained "in addition" the doctorate in labour law - she entered her first position in 2012 as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016, she moved to Regensburg, where she was a parent, and eventually moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial posts.
When the job had been advertised in Eggenfelden because of the imminent retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full career recovery, the 39-year-old explains.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday delegation at the notarial station in the future, and has a commendation for the law firm's team: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the forthcoming shifting of the private food point.
She has already made contact with a local institution in the field of kindergarten and cribs.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15.000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled by 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Because of the remoteness that must be observed, we are planning to have between 12,000 and 15,000 viewers at present," said Carsten Cramer, Managing Director of Borussia.
Normally, the arena in the district town at Bundesliga plays slightly more than 81,000 spectators.
In last season's ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation, hopes that in addition to the normal audience places, some of the approximately 4000 seats can be opened in the hospitality area: "Of course, it is a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all would be "well advised to take a stable length of time for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work alone in Germany, the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing manager praised the BVB professionals for their salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short-term work".
Few Wonders: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a packer butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 years old, which is taken care of annually at the children's clinic in Graz.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even one kilogram birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and especially made for them mini-winds.
But not so small that they're not in voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the Classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the beginning of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester of the Theater of the City of Aalen presented the production "The Home Dress" to the students - per video.
Afterwards, the students were able to share the piece and performance with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation had been born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the enrichment of the teaching.
Even if all the participants agreed at the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional excitement, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round triggered: The TSV 1860 would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV qualify for the DFB Cup in 1860, the lions meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the release on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup stand firm.
The lions would meet in a successful qualification at Eintracht Frankfurt.
This resulted in the release on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because because of the Corona pandemic the participant field is not yet complete, the placekeepers were used in the release.
The TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September) due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen.
There the lions meet either the Würzburg kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If Würzburg were to reach the finals, Sechzig would already have qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to enforce in the end game against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and a week before the Third League.

The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio signed it for seven years and brought it out at the side of Eroll Flynn.
Eight films shot her with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Motherherz".
Three years later the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
Much recognition was also given to her as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dark Spiegel" and "Die Snakengrube".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her leading role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece has become a worldwide success.
With her long-standing girlfriend Bette Davis she played in "Wiegenlied für eine Leiche".
From his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke.
However, rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler miss Finale at Comeback
The second round of the World Cup Julius Thole and Clemens Wicker have missed the finals at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they submitted their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last time, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the end game on the Rhine, their Bezwinger Ehlers/Flüggen collected a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured their tickets.
Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbititz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fiction sheet" and does not change anything about the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the Radical iceberg in the AfD," said FDP politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Bundesschiedsgericht der AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiation the exclusion of Kalbititz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by majority in May.
Kalbititz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume commented: "That Andreas Kalbititz is now excluded, says nothing and doesn't change anything," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It rather speaks volumes, how many French supporters still have a right extreme in the middle of the AfD".
Flower assumes that the AfD will return to less than five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted".
Kalbititz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "Flügels" around the Thuringian AfD-Landes- und Group chairperson Björn Höcke; the Constitutional Protection signifies the string as "secured right-wing extremist pursuit".
In May, the AfD federal council had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremes "Heimattrauen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and with the Republicans.
Kalbititz contests membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing group in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesschiedsgericht did not change anything about the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbititz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the Right Wings were weakened by this decision.
"The maneuvering of the muskets is permeable.
One wants to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and tries to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not release the spirits she called.
A rauswurf doesn't change anything," commented Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here, the AfD-Landesverband and the Group held to this day as their right leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbititz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now be taking civil action against the decision of the Bundesschiedsgericht.
North Sea wind farms deliver well 21 percent more electricity
The wind turbines on the German North Sea fed electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year 11.51.
This is well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the net area of Tennet, have fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh).
The total wind current from the North and Baltic Seas is 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The sea-based wind crop thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than one year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due, in addition to the wind ratios, to higher production capacities, because new wind farms have joined the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full force, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030 it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we are investing up to 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot use their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a little anniversary party at 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded the usual setting after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
The club "Sandtogether" was formed in the north of the gallery.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day celebration planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and, knowing how difficult it is economically for those involved, we have hoped for it until the last minute," said Uwe Rumberg, Mayor (partyless).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands had been poured onto the grounds and into the main tent, minimum distances, hygiene rules and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a popular festival.
Moreover, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately by a multiple.
Rumberg voted for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 as well as the Saxony Day from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Not to beat dress-olympian Werth in achleiten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four victories at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with consecration gold and Quantaz, she was also in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and in the choir.
At the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold, Werth made a special effort against Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
On Saturday, the Germans were also standing on Quanta before their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werths winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is to establish the ten-year stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quanta it was the first round at all.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14 to 16 August.
Future air traffic controller in Worms
The Wormser Hochschule continues into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" Foundations a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the beginning of the study not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This enables twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS Academies are equally exploited.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been studying air traffic control at Worms University in the Air Traffic Management programme.
This year already nine students started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the benefits of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lotsen profession.
"In these times we do not find economic support easy.
However, we are confident that air transport will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of the DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation's professorship is a future-proofing investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, technically cross-cutting knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The Foundation Professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it we would like to connect to the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German air traffic control was for the University of Worms' motivation and commitment to further expanding its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
With the first Stiftungsprofessure for a dual course of study, the university could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasises: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air transport, has a unique character in Rhineland-Palatinate.
The signing of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopters land on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully locked in the direction of Aschaffenburg on Saturday afternoon, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old drove straight in the curve with a Ford at 12.40 am in the exit Alzenau-Mitte and landed at the main plank.
The front airbags were triggered by the impact, the driver suffered slight injuries on his face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were provided by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, in which a damage of about 2000 euros was caused, had to be towed off.
Health wants to check other industries according to meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the states back to light in parts of the meat industry.
Law enforcement is in the near future.
But are they right - and will it remain?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other sectors of the meat industry in accordance with the strict regulations that are now in place.
"We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer is already warning against restricting works contracts in general.
After the mass outbreak of Corona at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to pass a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should not be allowed to use foreign personnel in the event of slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of works contracts and temporary workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of works contracts and employee transfer if you do not want to completely abandon the economy".
For example, works contracts were the basis for their value added to the customer for large areas of the craft, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts were meaningful.
"When an industrial company instructs a craftsman to install a safety facility, this is a very normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and rental work solely in its industry to be unconstitutional.
It was not possible to explain why, in future, other labour law than for sausage should apply to serving and packaging cheeses, according to an opinion on the legislative project, as reported by the "New Osnabrück Newspaper" (Saturday).
Thus, in the case of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from contract companies worked in the industry part 16 hours a day after the results of an examination of the NRW occupational safety and health services.
They often didn't have a break.
Pay has been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But by "tricky constructions," they had been bypassed.
"Now needs to be thoroughly cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we intend to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, also measures that concern not only the meat industry - for example, higher labour protection audit rates or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
This draft contains amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more stringent controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to do even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said nunnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktau".
However, more staffing would be necessary for more controls.
Three dead at the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed into a multifamily house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to police reports.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, said a spokesman of the Wesel District Executive.
A parachute had been found at the scene of the accident, says the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported in reference to eyewitnesses that before the crash the aircraft had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Raumung von Frankfurter Opernplatz walk peacefully
A week after the openings in Frankfurt, the rooming of the opera place during the night on Sunday is also peaceful.
Finally, some dozen people stopped in the square, but left him at 1 o'clock before the start of the night.
The police have been in service since the early evening with numerous officials, and there was a greater police commission throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onward, there was a restraining order for the opera site on which Krawallen had arrived a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrations.
At least five officers were injured after police charges, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car Overcame: Young woman in accident on federal road 83 at Hofgeismar badly injured
In the event of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday against 13.25.
She was taken to the Kassel Hospital.
With thermal cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible drivers.
According to the police, the woman was on federal road 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme on the road, when her car came from previously unexplained cause and overcame several times.
To save the injured, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
As it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was picked up from the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, has also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the forces of deployment did not find anyone between the high corn plants.
The heavy injured was brought to the Kasseler Klinikum by the life-rescue car.
Almost 50 operational forces from the Hofgeismar fire brigade, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was blocked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redemption gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team of five-time world footballers perfected the 36th scudetto of the club history with a 2:0 (1.0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, who did not last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to displace two games days before the end of the season of the series A.
The table-wide Inter Milan has seven points behind it.
Juventus was harmless in spite of optical superiority in the first half of the time, and Ronaldo met with the last action after a free kick.
The 35-year-old Miralem Pjanic took advantage of the limit of the penalty area directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in 2.0% of the more offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This secured the sheer but decisive success.
The Foullfmeter shot at the latte in the 89th minute should only have really beaten Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal hunter's valuation.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turinians had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve’s calming advantage at the top of the table was due to the weakness of the competitors, most of all.
For in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only won five.
It's questionable whether Ronaldo will be king of goalkeepers.
For while the Portuguese superstar scored 31 goals, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobole has already scored 34 hits on his account at the Hellas Verona after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome, which was celebrated in the table, as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern.
The current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
In the 2015–2016 season, the Argentinean made 36 goals for the SSC Naples.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon, he has to make a 0.1-gauge to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next round of K.o, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - All threatened penalties and court convictions despite many illegal races on the Baden-Wurttemberg streets continue to give gas: Last year and the first four months of this year, police in the South West have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although comparative values do not exist for the years before, the Rasers are increasingly working for the judiciary: In the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 for illegal racing, one year later it was already 252 and in the current year until early June 151.
The race was less about organized events, as the answer of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, drivers have spontaneously attacked each other or have taken the escape from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
In particular, German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were taxed.
113 fines - 15 imprisonments
Only in a few cases, the shavers are caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Rather, because of the tragic accidents and processes of past years, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before and showed more often, said a ministry spokesman.
Rasern is particularly popular with the highway 8. Always, motorists slow down traffic there to make room and use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular racetrack
On the A81, the police even recorded more races than on any other highway.
With a tempo limit, there is an attempt to brake the shaver on the particularly affected section between the narrow and the hostages.
The mostly high-priced and up-to-date sports and luxury cars often have Swiss distinguishing marks, because the riders deviate to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and driving cars in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced on a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 km/h, we would create this problem on highways by the body," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD-Landtagsfaktion.
"Raser's inhibitory threshold would be significantly higher if you didn't go here and there legally at 200 km/h and more".
From information or image campaigns, Rivoir holds less: "He who makes such a move over all the rules and not only puts his own life at risk, but also the lives of other road users is scarcely accessible with reason."
ADAC calls for more police intervention
This is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred from the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even harder controls on the routes concerned.
Three people died in the race all over the country since January 2019 and until April 2020, two of whom were not involved in a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came from the street, boasted against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured during the last two years.
However, sharper penalties are not necessary in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "The need for legislative action in order to sanction illegal motor racing is not seen in the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light of 23 July: thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into an snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran in the direction of the snack.
There he noticed a man who used to use the fridge with drinks and then left the snack through a previously opened entrance door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black pants and bright shoes.
Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to win at the end of Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory at the end of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old coat of fur from the Bora-hansgrohe team went through the 109-kilometre-long section with the start and goal in Hermannstadt in the mass print after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victory three and four for Ackermann.
Gregor Mühlberger, an Austrian teammate, performed in the overall ranking.
The 26-year-old had chosen the mountain-timer for himself in the morning and thus took the top in the class.
Only 104 riders had arrived at the end of the evening.
Not less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit during mountain riding.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a victory," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters in front of the target he just put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the UCI World Association, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated in isolated hygiene bubbles from the organization team as well as from the media.
Spectators at the start and destination were not allowed.
Headquarters gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multifamily house, a child (4) was suddenly in the water when bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived shortly before 3 p.m.
"A commanding officer immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," said a fireman to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took the resuscitation measures only a little later.
The child who lives in danger was transported to the university clinic under animation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police have routinely started investigations into the accident.
The fireman: "We're going out of a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nürnberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police Integrates, 700 Vehicles and around 1100 People
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated on Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police made their announcement to monitor such events more closely.
A big Tuning meeting came on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg South Town.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconia police, an increased vehicle load in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße had been detected by the Nuremberger Verkehrspolizei about 10:30.
As a result, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
Only recently the police had announced that they would step up against so-called car bags.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "Scene"
The officials were at the top of 700 cars and about 1100 people, the police are accounting.
However, only a small proportion of those present are associated with the "Autoposer" and Tunningszene.
Apparently, most of the scene in this respect was followed by the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons present on the spot, it was assumed that they were mostly showy.
In addition, the majority of those present were in the current protection regulations, in particular the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site control measures were completed at about 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found in 10 vehicles such structural changes that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There was no illegal car racing.
"The police Bureau of Central Franconia will continue to keep an eye on the situation and will continue to carry out reinforced control measures, including in the context of the emergence of constables," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger about the involved towing company: "They have all beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," Schrödinger said.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company had to be careful not to make any damage.
"The young people should finally keep their cars intact".
Figures from the Agency: 900 suspected abuse cases at short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) reports that around 900 suspect cases are committed to abuse of the short-time employee pay.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have indicated short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive director responsible for the operational business of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis a lot of companies suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test lasted up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more precisely, we'll look at the final calculations.
I'm sure there'll be something else.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
Evidence of abuse often came from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvency than in the previous year?
The estimates differ, but we are alerting ourselves in the case of the case and are already training our employees in the work agencies for processing applications for insolvency payments."
The figures were still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party Dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, some 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the governors of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed of the PNN request.
The young people would then have left the park.
On Saturday evening some young people would have played in the New Garden Rugby.
The meadow had been cleared by Revierfahrer, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Time and again it comes to illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always collections where the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 bypass regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June, there had been a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the new garden.
Even without the Corona regulation, the parks are closed at the start of the darkness.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to Parkordnung, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal parking parties have meanwhile reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: mass tests to Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still available in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young trainees have been tested in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The closing hour was set at 23:00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there," said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourist Association, Hans Wierser, the dpa.
Guests are also on their way in advance.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 nights last year.
In a normal season, around one third of the guests are German.
On Friday the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the trainees who had celebrated in several localities and could have been infested there.
"We all liked doing that in our youth," he said to the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre for the spread of Corona throughout Europe at the beginning of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus on new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after one year of absence.
The Red Devils secured the third table seat with a 2:0 (0.0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City on the last day of the Premier League.
The Foxes must now be satisfied with the Europe League because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified as a fourth for the king class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the replay time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League final opponent of the FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton hikers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also standing in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea Coach.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also profited Tottenham Hotspur, which with a lean 1:1 (1.0) at Crystal Palace still passed the Wolves and starts as sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) glich Andrej Jarmolenko (85.) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which ransacked three trainers in the season, rises after five first years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself through a 3:1 (2:1) FC Everton.
At the end, a point was missing.
FC Liverpool, who has been ranked as an English champion since the end of June, won a 3-1 (1:1) club record at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the score record in English football.
Manchester City holds 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) turned the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
As a result of the Coronavirus crisis, the football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature break-off or an execution of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Finally, the season could be ended without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrested and violent in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Head of Government Netanyahus are becoming increasingly fierce.
There have been violent clashes in the night.
The Israeli police took violent action on the night of Sunday in Jerusalem against a demonstration against the right-wing government chief Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participating in unrest, police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld told them.
The police, among other things, used water guns to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanjahu's county seat.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protesters struck drums, blew horns and called Netanyahu to resign.
There were also participants in an area survey who supported Netanyahu, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a driving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a trade fair attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was easily injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was also criticized for his use of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is being held in a hurry and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the country's economy difficult.
The unemployment rate was at last more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel has recently risen to new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A ride accident claimed nine light injuries at the B58 at Ahlen on Saturday afternoon.
One car driver was on his way to Beckum with her two children (3, 5).
The police said, "Perhaps she had stopped suddenly because she wanted to turn down."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her must have seen this too late.
He's strong on the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the transporter were easily injured in the accident.
Several rescue cars took them to an surrounding hospital.
North Korea locks border city to Corona case
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own anti-coronavirus measures.
Now the country is reporting a suspect for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona case in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a big city from fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures over the past six months, "the evil virus could have been dragged into the country," reported the State media.
For the region around Kaesong the border town, the emergency situation had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicion were confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the decapitated country.
Until now, North Korea had not registered a single infection and described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms were identified by a "outbreaker" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation of the border crossing within the four kilometres wide and, for the most part, of the still-reduced military buffer zone from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military cleared the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There were investigations into some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party's Politburo, chaired by Kim Jong Un, was held for suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure, "to block Kaesong completely and to isolate each district and the region from others," it continued.
The data subject, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outbreak" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
Some 300,000 people live in Kaesong, according to estimates.
Stress in front of the Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still under discussion in the summer.
"In addition to environmental topics, the members of the Board will also vote on the construction plan for the large-scale inner-city development-east project," says it rather casually in the middle of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed until the end.
The majority of them are scarce, most recently even in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which emerged from the citizenship and then developed by the administration and municipal council not to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticised project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extraparliamentary opposition", "inconceivable", "speculation", "fixion" and "conscious false statements".
"All mean better to know," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for one year as the only representative of the citizens' list of Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit of the city is cheaper, the technical town hall is contrary to statements by the city administration according to grants, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently when forecasting in the town hall and on the part of the proponents from the economy.
The city by its own strength and not by an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially foresees the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the castle mountain, the rental of the ex-Thal for administrative areas and a smaller city centre transformation ideally with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
Above all, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim against health noise caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of this because by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned paces and by little commitment to cycling they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the accession to the Climate Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban day care facilities and the request for inclusion in the Smart City Fund of the Federal Republic of Germany is on the agenda.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to take care of Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season in ADAC GT Masters with almost half a year's delay on July 31st.
Before the Supersports Car League could start operating regularly, the first test runs were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing for a long time.
Under special hygiene conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen filmed his first rounds on the Lausitzring ring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go differently into the curves.
But it has really been a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT-Sport, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand us dazzlingly and we made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from Session to Session as well".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also perform his first race.
From 31 July the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was a guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the route a little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann is then really, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams poker, of course, in the tests a little," he says.
"At the end of the week we are very happy and looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pressed calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
Currently stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the middle of August at the Nürburgring, Ex-Formel-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will grab into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantine Decision caught cold
According to press reports, the UK Government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return caught the country's transport minister coldly.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Because of the rising corona numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet broke the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so will Shapps also have to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are only on the leave of the day, only from Saturday, August 1st, and were not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, has so far been regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine for holidaymakers will be imposed in Spain," said Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to say Grant Shapp's message."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the numbers of infections in the country are rising again.
Virologists are mainly responsible for the nightlife for the recent spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the United Kingdom.
The UK Government is currently advising from unnecessary trips to mainland Spain, the Canary and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers, are exempted from this.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel Coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced to the Marine Day in his country an equipment of warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the battle possibilities of the Russian maritime forces would be expanded, said Putin at the Central Marine-Parade on Sunday in St. Petersburg.
According to the Interfax Agency, the Ministry of Defence also informed about the successful tests of the hypersonic missile Zircon built for the Marine.
The hypersonic weapons exhibit a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwatertropedeo continues to be built
It was also built on the nuclearly available underwater torpedo Poseidon, called it.
The planned ocean drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself was also on a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be deployed to the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, said Putin on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Even on many other Russian shores, the sea forces began the sea day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside master Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus strength.
Munitions were also fired there.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defense not only were warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help for Corona is difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this season across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the US state, announced the National Hurricane Center of the US Air Warrior NOAA at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called out the emergency for many districts.
The corona pandemic in Texas made the work of the helpers difficult, said Abbott according to the U.S. media.
Called to Caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
Looking at the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and will be exacerbated if one considers that he is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by the Covid-19 area of the state".
According to Johns-Hopkins University, as a result of the Corona pandemic, around 5,000 people died alone in Texas.
Abbott called people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not ignore practices "to which we have gotten used", such as wearing masks, said the Governor according to the CBS transmitter.
It was important that all distances were kept.
For this reason, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, emergency rooms should be tested on Corona.
First, damage had only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Revoked
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island just off the Texan coast on land, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been raised to the hurricane of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had first been issued and later taken back.
The authorities expected a weakening while "Hanna" moved further into the interior of the country and headed towards the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves on Hawaii to
In the Pacific, Hurrikan "Douglas" was on the road on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour towards Hawaii.
The Hurricane Centre, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the prediction, he should be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic this year, after a May forecast, NOAA expected an above-averagely active hurricane season.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes were expected, of which up to six could become very strong cyclones, the Authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only at 30 percent, which was one below average even at ten percent, it was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government closely watched the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four Tore Aberkannt: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were immediately recognized two goals
Naples - 4 goals scored, four goals won: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rough evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league series A - and was really angry at the video assistants of the referee.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so hard on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had taken the lead through a gate of Elseid Hisaj, an outside defender, in the 8th minute, during which Filip Djuricic initially praised the compensation.
The Video Assistant Reference (VAR) withdrew the hit due to an abstinence position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR entered.
Also the gates of attackers Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) withdrew the referee team according to the VAR.
In the post-play period, Allan perfected the 2:0 end for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick recovered "somehow well," has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who was behind Captain Manuel Neuer and middle field manager Joshua Kimmich, was given the third-highest minutes of operation, suffered an injury to the left footroot and threatened to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven with a golf card from the square.
How long the unlimited regular player has to pause in the struggle for the title is open.
A stake in the eighth-final rebound game against FC Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, and the 24-year-old may hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
But the Bavaria do not want to be stopped by the mischief from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes that he wants to see from his stars on his way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victorious collectors in the 28 days to the end of the king's class on August 23 in the ideal case.
"We have just mastered the compulsory tasks with mastery and trophy.
Now it's important to make the special one," said Flick.
Until the Munichers can specifically deal with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, the eighth-final platform against the FC Chelsea is on the ground for the first time.
After the 3:0 win in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not become the Bavarian nightmare again as in the lost "Final dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust with a good game," demanded Flick.
A vote test will be held on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long talk, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a one-off August.
31 players welcomed him on the Zäbener Straße, including the new players for the noble buy-in of Leroy Sané, who met all the new colleagues on the square for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has put himself in good shape like all the new ones," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. can no longer only train, Flick would much rather talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, the Londoners are trained in team strength, which are in contrast to the flick ensemble in the rhythm of the game.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter-final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi; in the semi-finals, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the finale in Lisbon "is not so easy," stressed the chief coach, who from Tuesday can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The Klose and Flick World Championship Recorder knows of so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-up-100 mood.
With his current team, the work was "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive feature of his team.
At the tournament with Neuner teams, it also went ambitious on Sunday.
All of the service providers were involved, including the emigrational Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not guaranteed beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup title.
All the American races were cancelled.
Racing calendar is getting more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prixs during the week.
In October, it is to be driven on the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão in Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting for World Cup points on the Italian traditional route in Imola.
This includes the 2020 race calendar after 13 races at present.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 Boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be held in the royal class of motorsport in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, media performances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulation requires racing on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require, however, at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are to be driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles under "extraordinary circumstances" because of the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the impending Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absage meets criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," said Carey.
The rejection of the American race was particularly critical in Brazil: "The rejection did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, Promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, infection figures in São Paulo are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams not to travel in Brazil would not justify rejection.
They were prepared for the security measures required.
Greta Thunberg: Böser Blick versus Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's famous latent show by video switch and told her in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest of a popular U.S. latenight show by video switch.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the mighty of the world.
The teenage girl also spoke about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has made her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latent show about her plans in the future as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedes.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to divert the focus from the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children go on the streets," she experienced.
Head of state and leading politicians who ridicule or even try to silence them in social media find them "lying" because they show the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached by a famous scene in which she threw a bitterly evil look behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
A GIF was created from the short clip, i.e. an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at that moment?
Stephen Colbert's relatively open question answered only briefly and dryly: "In order to be honest, I do not think that needs any further explanation."
With the resultant response, the experienced Satiriker Colbert had probably not expected and disappeared laughing from the picture for a short time.
With her "How are you?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobilie with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race around Europe's Golden Shoe with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobilie has continued to have the best chance of becoming a goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
At 5:1 (1:1), the former BVB-Profi helped Lazio Rome win three matches at Hellas Verona, including two eleven meters converted into both halves.
Thus, the 30-year-old has now 34 season gates in his account before the end of the two season games in the fourth table - as many of them scored by FC Bayern Munich in the end of the Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider on Sampdoria Genoa in the evening.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went down steeply and then slowly up again.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult adherent: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had since founded the legendary band in London in 1967, so far its dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is forgotten.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid ascent - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
It should have been disputed, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the Group's profits for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Also mental problems should have played a role.
Green left the band three years after it was founded in 1970.
It followed a social descent.
The Bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as cinemas reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture.
He should have lived on the street for a while, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a long time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the city of Bethnal Green in London.
In his early years, he was enthusiastic about American blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At eleven years he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teen started playing professional guitar and five years later was given the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
He was later involved in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green created the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascent soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not force the media drum, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac are swimming in a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold itself more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not manage to make a big comeback until in 1996 he started a new group of friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returning to the earth at that time.
Free from drugs, Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend at the time of his life - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
