Crying to the World
The market campaign of Look’s Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and shouts and shouts out in the wild are now pulling people wide and wide around the world.
"You own the tunnel, I need Iceland," said one woman out in the big world in commenting on the announcement from the marketing campaign Look Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another audience will say hello to Iceland for all eternity, and a young woman says she has to get to Iceland first and foremost be her fiancé there.
However, in the United States, she is unhappy and expects to wait for another month.
Another audience asks if the walk to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn't tell us if he's from another time belt.
Egill Thordarson of Peel, the advertising office that created the ads together with the international advertising office M&C Saatchi, says reception has been hoped again.
“I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already being evaluated.
In the foundation this is about creating a PR value, it's getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it's been going incredibly well.
Over a relatively short period of time, we have received reports in about seven hundred worldwide media that total over two billion people.
The value of this coverage is worth $1.8 billion.
It's not that bad."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well, although the Americans are not on their way to the country in the near future.
According to Egils, such market areas as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also been welcomed, such as Russia, which is surprisingly comfortable.
Then there have been reactions from foreign areas, such as India, that were not specifically addressed.
“These ads have gone beyond what we expected,” says Egill, who may have seen over four million people watching YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wished for a better start.”
The photographs here on the opening took the Year of Sea Mountain, the photograph of the morning magazine, on advertisements bearing the headline 'Let It Out' in the middle of the last month.
The vessels went out wide and wide, such as in the School of Reykjavík, in Reykisvíra, in Forest Phoss, in the Mountain of Sol, and in the cave of Hörlephskopf.
The principals were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Ólafsson at Scottish productions and a taker of Fear of the Son of God.
In roles in conflict, the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary, were involved.
Tens of Iceland arrived, but at the same time as the tapes were made in the South, there was another group in the West and West.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first team in the Look's Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in cooperation with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic office," says Egill, adding that cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign collaborators with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosives: Talk about the job market, a living fund, and much more
Mr Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Childhood, arrives at Sprigand, which starts at 10 a.m. on the Wave today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair issue and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and transportation to poor countries that have been under discussion over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of VR, will also be present, but he will discuss his criticism of investments in life-share funds and present ideas that labor movement and employers will withdraw from the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then will be discussed with Ivar the son of Ingimars, a traveling servant in the Orient, and with the daughter of Árnhei, the manager of the market place in the north, about the places in the country.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading command of what is to be done.
You can listen to the section below, but it starts at 10:00.
That's what she looks like today 25 years later.
Elisa Donovan, a playwright, had a successful career in all aspects of youth.
World famous, however, she was playing a game like Amber in Clueless’s movie 25 years ago.
Then she also played in the parts of Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
She has seen her face, yet she was moved to look over the road and express herself about Cluess on an in - love TV on the days.
She speaks nicely of Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I was mostly based on girls I met at school who were not good at me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after nightfall.
About fifty cases came at police level in the capital area today, saying in the police ’ journal that there was a variety of things.
The day at the neighborhood police station began by the fact that police had to interfere with a man who had been recently released from a prison cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
If the man did not want to go away after he was released, he would not obey the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man won a continuing stay at the police station because of his conduct.
Then a man was arrested in the morning, suspected of burglary in a Copavogi company.
Police also had to be involved in two men in Breidholti because of reports of a physical attack.
Then, too, a woman who was sitting in a shopping mall in Copavogi could not pay for the bill at the end of a meal and was therefore called to the police.
The car was also stolen from the city center this morning.
For a moment, a white transport driver looked at her, and she was taken without a hand.
The car hasn't been found.
Cursed by the Glee Club - The Terrible Destiny of the Glee Mountains
This theory has caught an Internet flight of curses over the show of the Joy Team, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California on the days and thus became the third main actor to let life live long before age.
The components of the joyous band (e. g.) are a popular series of songs, dances, and joys.
These included a so - called youth cheer - up team in high school, their love, and their destiny.
It was not always taken with the happy spirit to be in the band, but through singing and dancing, the characters seemed to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the scene, the actors and the employees have been hit by a great deal of disaster, so much so that theories have awakened that a curse lies on the parts.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santáná Lopez, a cheerleader who did not call his grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went to have Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently understood them.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint, and home violence was dropped.
On July 8, last, Rivera was reported to be missing after her four - year - old son was found drifting alone on Lake Pira, California.
The boy found himself sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to report to the police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed themselves to death, and Rivera had brought him back to the boat but had never returned to the boat.
Started an extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search, the police chief in the area reported that we were looking from the point of view of Rivera’s drowning.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is thought to have suffered a great deal of energy in the water, and it is now using its last requirement to save the Son.
Causes of death were recorded drunk by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson, the American footballer with the angelic reputation that played a key role in bringing the band to the fore and respect.
In addition, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and had found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates felt sufficient in their roles, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to look all the way to a better way.
Only two months after finishing treatment, Moneith found himself dead in a hotel room after having had a good time with friends.
Banamein was a fatal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a willful act.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerability to drug donors had been reduced to such an extent that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but his hostess, Leah Michele, was determined to continue his activities and dedicated them to the memory of Moneith and his person Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the games, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his teammates in the Gleeds, or until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles and suspected of child abuse.
At his home, a large amount of child pornography was found, and soon the case was publicly questioned.
Apparently, Salling was gone.
He was subsequently accused and convicted of his crimes.
He had a four - to seven - year - old prison in addition to what he would come to have to keep a record of sexual offenders and seek treatment for child - abuse.
Before deciding the punishment, Salling, who was then released from bail, was found to be close to his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors who had fallen from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was an assistant director of the show.
In 2013, he was quickly shaken to sleep, only 41 years of age.
A woman named Nancy Motes was also involved.
She was a younger sister of the great star Julia Roberts and did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes, who suffered from severe depression, took her own life in 2014.
She left a letter to her fiancée, including her mother and sister, responsible for how she was treated.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings get nothing but the memory that they were my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her siblings as a bully and a bully in the scene and of having a superhero.
Jesse Luke played a guest role in the 2012 program.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was highly scandalous.
The player Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
It happened in 2010 that unspoiled breakdowns were released in naked pictures of it and on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the parts and had a love relationship outside the parts.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
Growing children increase when they are allowed to play outdoors with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do so with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the children in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the blossoms, the aroma, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Purchased a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we're a lot of sailors working in the country's playgrounds," says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, who's fishing for the summer while taking up psychology at Iceland University during the winter."
Sea fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can make good money, and I think it's great that you can let go of a study loan.
The funds also do me well in the winter," said Axel Orn Gudmundsson, 25-year-old psychologist, who fished for the summer like the last summer.
Axel was the newest to dock on Tálknavel when a journalist reached a talk of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The tenth - grade race I took a boat - management privilege that is less than 20 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I've been fishing at my boat every summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann the son of Jon, and I called the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very satisfied when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," said Axel, adding that he bought the boat in three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, the other half at the end of the summer when I had fished.
So at the end of this first summer, I had the boat without debt."
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay out in a boat when he had finished elementary school?
“ I had made plans and collected money; I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy; I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my quarters in my boat fund."
Axel was born on the plain of Izaphael, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in the Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the west because I have a legal residence at my grandmother’s house on Ísaväftur.
I learned in these areas west of rowing with my dad.
I'm moving in between ways, depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all over the West.
Although I feel the best way to be in the west, I have also been around snowfall and many other areas.
I've also provided for the south, but that's the best grey slipper," said Axel, who always runs one firel in the morning and says sometimes talking to the seagulls and singing to the sky, in the lonely hours out on the ball.
“ The Internet on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to radio and music.
I don't think it's worth being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid falling into high esteem, but certainly sometimes something has been wrong, but never much danger," said Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing goes on each time.
“I’ve never been fishing more than 14 hours at a time in the beach, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the cottage, but then I’ve been fishing for a day and a half in the bait of the sea.”
The beach fishing arrangement says that he is allowed to fish seven hundred and seventy pounds a day, which he considers to be a hindrance.
“ Another obstacle is that I can’t hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only hunt 12 days a month, these four months of shore fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days for weather and nothing else.
Rather than having 48 days throughout the summer, these unnecessary pressures are to be calmed down and can be selected according to their heads.
So could the regional change go for me too, and a well-placed television lock should enjoy it," says Axel, who draws the greatest thirst from salted seas on his shores, but also only wild and unique other species flow with.
Axel works over the winter season with a university degree at the Nupi School in Copavogi.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors working in the country’s playgrounds,” says Axel proudly and adds that he was just going to work at the theatre for a while.
“ I got stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that my psychology studies will take advantage of my future schooling," says Axel, who has also been a long time in business studies.
An error occurred while trying to register
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused a person, resident here on land, to not be called back to show.
If the person fills the form in English, as is the case in Icelandic, then this number will not be required.
"This will be examined in the week," says a local health specialist.
Three domestic infections were detected at the National Hospital’s viral ward yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the land on July 15, two days after the rules for so - called home disease came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened at the arrival to the country and again announced in vision four to five days later.
On the other hand, on the afternoon news from RUV, the subject had followed the old system.
The border inspection was negative and it was not recalled in the screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a regional health expert, says in a conversation with a news agency that this could be caused by an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, they are not required to put a number in the same way as in the Icelandic version.
In the first place, it has been thought of by foreign travelers.
Therefore, the individual has not received an automatic invitation to participate in the show.
Kamilla, however, says that many have followed rules on homecoming media although they have filled the registration form in English and, in some cases, employers have also been alert to sending people to show again after they have arrived in the country.
“This will be examined in the week how it is possible to make it easier for people to make their access easier to get their attention focused on the process.”
The man is isolated and six have been hospitalized.
They all go on show, but two of them were starting to show symptoms.
Imitation is now taking place at the three infections detected yesterday, mostly due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequence analysis of Íslandske Genital Analysis has shown that there are coronal virus variants not previously found here.
In the second case, the ban has focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who transported the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be there tomorrow when the other virus was coming.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the MOVID web site.
135 are infected.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been reported here in the last few days.
Of these, the four alphas are not connected and have not been developed to develop the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports event yesterday.
Immitation is still present.
Originally, in the third century C.E., they were sent to the hospital on an unusually large scale, reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 of these new infections were detected yesterday.
This is the second time that infection is diagnosed at sporting events and has raised questions as to whether such events should take place.
John K. Johnsson, Chief of Communications at the National Police Department, says it slowly, as long as people follow guidelines and regulations.
“We are constantly pressing for all those who live here that they need to maintain an individual protection system.
We also need to be sensitive to people who are holding on to the fact that there are certain rules that need to be applied.
"Then there is an event to be held," said John.
He says that the prevention of infection can be done by holding the air of individual pesticides.
In addition, rules and standards are subject to constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what is constantly pressing the attention of the General Department of Public Health and the National Institute of Medicine, is taking into account these individual infectious agents.
Both at home and also at service companies.
People wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents infection from continuing," says Johann.
“We need to focus on people to continue on the good road we were on in order to keep up with the results we’ve achieved here.”
40% victim lambs of COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was getting the breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronary viral infections.
Diabetes mellitus was reported on the death certificate as the underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same thing will happen to her.
The Reuters reporter says fear of Brumfield is not for no reason.
The numbers of new studies conducted by the U.S. authorities show that up to 40% of those who have died had diabetes 2 as a underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who did not reach 65 years of age is considered, the ratio increases to half.
A study of the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the coronary virus during the February to May period.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious disease expert, says that the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
When Reuter’s slow growth was hidden, the answers from the 12 countries that responded to comparable proportions were analysed.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already a slow growth epidemic.
Now the COVID—19 has broken through like a powerful age," Reuters, led by Elbert Huang, president of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of southern American origin, who have also become worse out of the coronary virus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with a healthy diet and help from a healthcare professional.
On the other hand, the Korean virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In this case, high insulin prices have forced some to continue to show up at work and stop exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities have been able to be aware of the risks that diabetics 2 might pose.
When SARS crossed the coronary virus in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in 2009 this group was three times more at risk of hospitalisation.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were enrolled in intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus may have lasted longer, the epidemic has removed the cover from a number of previously unknown complications.
“I fear we will see a flood wave of problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Sugar Association.
Physicians have warned that the coronary epidemic may lead to an indirect increase in diabetic complications, including renal disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies suggest that the siron virus may lead to an increase in diabetic cases.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronin virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
In this case, the high percentage of glucose and lipids in diabetic patients can induce a real - life “cell - signal storm, ” as called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“This is all one big puzzle, ” says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected."
The story has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, so they left the room"
The husband Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason made the unusual request of the artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother, Ásruna Magnúsdódur.
“ It made me very fond of it.
It was, of course, just the radiation, but I also thought it was extremely sweet.
And still likes," he says.
Ásrún also remembers the end of his husband’s first meeting regularly.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend only," said she, who was also drawn to the husband at first sight.
“I found and felt so excited around Atla, whom I liked.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on, and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that his wife and I have stressed the need to go their own way.
“ We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We avoid routines that we detect around us."
This is possible because they took the errand of Ragnar Kjartan’s son, an artist, only with joy, although it was said quite unusually.
“Christine Anna, our common friend, will contact us and ask if we can come and eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg of Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the triplet on Snaps, and received dessert wine, and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans at a picture show that he thought would be staged in the fall of Palais de Tokyo in Paris.
“ He had a multiplicity of knowledge called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as a banal and decadent late from the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the tendons he was going to shoot, and last, he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in. ”
Later, Ragnar asked the couple to join in showing a young midwayer to love in a minimalist room.
“It’s sex with the beginning and the end, ” says Atli.
The couple did not know much about Ragnar, although they knew about him, and he “but they knew us and felt fit.
They said that they did not want to advertise by people.
Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who had sexual addiction from performing for others."
They voted for Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“ When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Aren’t we just ready for this? ’
It was just like that.
I trusted Ragnari as an artist and all his team," said Ásrún and Atli.
"This is about love and neighbor"
Senan was picked up in a nice apartment on the morgue.
There was a very rare film studio; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a musician, and the couple.
After a recording, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We didn’t decide what we should be like.
We received some counsel, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn't a game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," said Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," Atli and Ásrún agreed.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little bit like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommi’s cameraman looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“This is as much about love as it is about closeness as it is about intercourse, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents saw the work and told Atli that his mother heard the voice in the Son of the Art Library of Reykjavik, and they realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts thinking about it,” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad sent me a message and said, "It's nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And would participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Ázrun and Atla?
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe it got deeper.
At least this deepened my relationship with my family," said Ásrún and laughed.
Ásrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it a little difficult not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one second in a much larger piece of work, and when you saw this with the other effects, it’s really cool.
I was able to get away from this and was just proud.
And there was the little beans in my stomach," said Ásrún, who was pregnant by one of the couple's children when the tendon was taped.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to the Sisters of Ásrúna and Atla in the Love Story of Rás 1.
Swansea winning the first finish game
Swansea won a 1-0 win at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the preliminary review of getting into the English primeval section.
The game took place at the Swansea home site in Wales.
Half-game position was 0-0.
The home of Swansea was given a suite in 64 minutes, while Andre Ayew failed the bogalistine from the point of vision and was protected.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, player Brentford, received the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less, and in 82 minutes, Swansea players took advantage of their contribution.
Andre Ayew added up the vitam by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea 1–0 victory.
So Swansea leads a 1-0 in the 1st round, but the second round takes place the next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Free of charge for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard where he feared for his life.
However, it has not been an effort for the presidents of the United States to order ambassadors here on land.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. ambassador’s office at the end of April 2009, there has been no ambassador in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office in special circumstances, but Kastjous reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falka word.
During a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Presidential Office that she would not be honoured.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until September 2010 by Van Voerst.
Some of this may be due to Robert S. Connan’s appointment as a ambassador, but he did so.
At last, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign service for decades.
In the fall of 2013, he then took up the position of ambassadors in Guatemala.
Then another period of unsolicited missionary service began.
Robert Barber received the agreement of the United States Congress in January 2015 and arrived shortly later, but no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was appointed political but not diplomati, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack’s Obama campaign.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took up the president’s office on January 20, 2017, as the custom is with a political appointed ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and senior officials in the Washington government.
As a result, two years passed until the U.S. Congress announced a meeting to Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask him out and finally confirm that he was a ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony at Congress, he said that he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his late wife had been broken by a Dutch mountain.
Gunter was a former skin doctor in California and has been prominent in the Jewish community in the Republic group, Republican Jewish Coalition.
The gambling owner Sheldon Adelson founded them as an organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest case in the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s control was to nominate people in key offices and that recent years the work of the United States Congress has been very slow, including the confirmation of ambassadors in office.
As of 2009, therefore, Iceland has been unsolicited for over five years.
This, however, has not prevented projects by the embassy that opened a recently opened headquarters at Enghetteig.
The operations are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the knotty safety walls surrounding the building and bulletproof glass are in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassadors ’ sense of security, for he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished for an armed bodyguard.
IBV's ex-player experienced racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, claims to have experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to the country.
This is seen in an interview with Tonny, which appears on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, which plays in Uganda’s top division.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including his time here on the country, but he played with IBV, Val and Dört in Iceland.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to.
The team's officer was in that position, but he also had the jersey number that I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," said Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was being said to me.
Later I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what it was all about.
He told me then that my opponent caused a racist speech to fall upon me after I had taken him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
It says that he made the most of his regrets.
Tonny hadn't gotten into Haugesund's initial team but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, but he went to help with Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland for a loan.
I think that if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," said Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland made up for his dreams of getting into the big league in Europe.
Find a worm in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-bit black worm in a woman's neck gland that searched there.
Doctors were able to pull out the worm with a pliers.
A study revealed that parasites were involved.
CNN will report this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashim, which are thin slices of flesh.
The woman soon recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi squabbled to bed in Western lands, cases of parasites that have spread to people have increased.
Fear of another wave emerging in Europe
Spain is now in the forefront of concern over the second cyclone virus wave in Europe, where governments have taken action to reinvigorate the spread of the cyclone virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all the fun life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelóna where infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the United Kingdom, everyone has to go home from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travelling to Spain.
The disease is also growing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to balance the virus’s spread and relaunch its economy.
The situation in Europe, however, is good for other parts of the world, but the incidence of global transmission is approaching 300 thousand a day, with the highest rates of transmission in America and South Asia.
As confirmed by John Hopkins University, 16 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with AIDS and have been diagnosed with deaths associated with the virus as 644 thousand.
At Last, Mosaic Works Will Be Enjoyed in the Fullest
In front of the Tower in Reykjavík there is a large deep hole.
It contains orange helmets.
There's a big tomb there, too.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
However, the walkway is a good one, and many people now stop and respect millions of mosaic tiles of art — as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it doesn't matter.
The work here has been hidden, right in front of it was a parking lot that was always handled.
People put the car there, locked it in a hurry, and then started to do their business in the city center.
'Live and diverse public spaces' and 'attractive urban centres' are a guiding principle for the current redesign of the Road to Safety.
The goal is to rejuvenate the area and allow the work of mosaics made by the Holy Daughter of the House to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work, there will be a square and, where the area is close to the sun, it is considered suitable as a sleeping area for road users.
The work of art will be illuminated, and the material will now be made to enjoy itself more fully than before on this 142 - square - foot [122 sq m] surface.
The area will also include small fogging sprayers, some kind of water cullet, which offer a game and give the territory some cover.
In this way, the refurbishments are described by the City of Reykjavik, which is carrying out operations with the Witnesses.
Water supply, heating, and electricity will be recycled.
Many of them have come to their age, but from 1925 onward, the school and the cold - water industry have served residents and businesses in the city center in less than a century.
When the street is reopened after construction, cars can rerun it.
However, it will be a unique street, and at the same time a calmer and accessible space will be created for the walker.
In 1971 the House was used by the customs director’s website, as an architect named Gísli Halldorsson.
Because of the damage to the harbor through the house, 250 square feet [250 m] of windows without walls were formed to the street.
A building committee and an architect agreed that such flats would adversely affect the overall picture, if no special arrangements were made to adorn the appearance of the house.
Thus, individuals agreed to be calculated by having a permanent work of art set up there.
At that time, a great deal of words came from Saint - daughter, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked hard to perform mosaic works in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to first contact her before a decision would be made whether or not to compete for the work.
The work had often been discussed as reflecting life at the port, since the port had been a lifeline of Reykjavik ever since it was built.
When talking to the artist, she had to think of such a work as this.
It was agreed that she would receive plans and other assistance before she left the country, since she would work on the suggestions abroad.
The time was set aside for her own decision, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
It was also desirable to enter into a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous art industry in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them to set up famous works of art around Europe.
Contracts were made, and Gerður worked on the workmanship of the brothers, who then arranged for the installation of the House of Customs.
All the work was extremely well done, both of which was the daughter of Helgad and the brother of Oidtmann, says in the summary.
Ever since then, it has resisted an unblemished Icelandic weather.
It took him about two years to do the work, which was carried out in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the customs union was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to transfer more establishments to the country
Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Dadason announces that more public institutions will be transferred to the country in the near future.
This was said by a minister in the program Explosive on the Wave at noon.
It has recently been reported that the Home and Human Resources Office burnout area will be transported north to the South Africa in the fall.
Six fire experts work at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the Agency north and have criticised the migration of livestock.
“ I think we should take another step in this creature.
I'm preparing a further step in this creature.
More transportation," said Ásmundur.
If he is convinced that the majority of the nation wants to see more public institutions spread throughout the country, he is convinced.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the Department of Human and Human Resources," said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the country and were very relevant to communities in the country, such as the Food and Agriculture Agency to Selfos, Iceland's survey to Akranes, and the unemployment insurance agency to Skagarand.
All the major things from the second day of the Great Cross
Iceland's 94th World Cup in Free Sport ended today at Thorsvell in Akureyri.
A number of matches were made on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition in women's besieging at Thorsvell was calculated, while Vigdi's daughter of FH put Icelandsmet in a slump in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from the IR added to his assessment in May last year.
Vigdis won back Iceland's record earlier in the summer and has been in a fan-shaped fashion since the fall, but she has consolidated Iceland's assessment of what's left of summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and has not recovered today.
She had only one valid five - foot - long [25.69 m] pitch, which is far from her best.
Vigdi’s cast the longest of all today, or 60.08 yards [60.08 m] in her last attempt and, as a matter of fact, made a convention.
Her Icelandic record record earlier in July is 62.69 meters and so she was rather from it.
Gudrun Karitas Hallgrím’s daughter from the IR had the second best shot of the day, but she made her best success with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In a male group, the FH-in-law, Hilmar Örn Jonsson, an Iceland sailor in a strike, won a victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last cast and made a match.
His Iceland record in the article is 75.26 meters.
The Godship of Valur Gudnason, the Olympics, and the Iceland Meteorologist, won a race on a ball at Thorsveld last night, but today he competed in a roundabout, his main feature.
The Icelandmet Gudna Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw a long time today at 59.13 meters and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hját Erlendsson threw his second pitch today, with one match that worked at the 2nd seat, at four feet [49.43 m].
Hafdi's Victory Daughter, Iceland's Long-Sleeved Sea, won the Long-Sturf Championship with superiority, but Hafdi's leap reached a distance of 625 meters today, which is less than 40 cm from its Iceland record.
In the 200-metre run of women it was the IR-ing Gudbjörg Jona Bjarnadóttir who was the worst, but she scored 24,04 seconds, but her Icelandic record in the article is 23,45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jonah won a prize in Akureyri, where she won two gold prizes last night, 100 yards [100 m], and 4 x 100 meters [100 m], and a 4 x 400 - foot [400 m] race today.
In a male group, the first goal of the 200 - meter race in 21,57 seconds, was to be Höður Gunnarsson from FH, 0.3 seconds before the son of Oliver Mána Samuel from Ármann.
Like Gudbjörg Jona, Kolbeinn Hudson won gold in 100 yards yesterday as well as in the 400 - foot [400 m] race.
Does not receive a fine for a $27 million bitcoin crop
An overtaxed committee has rejected the tax researcher’s requirement that you be fined for misappropriating the financial resources that were available for the sale of the electricity coin Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not provided clear evidence as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
The Committee’s decision states that the tax investigation director considered the person to be eligible for materially incorrect tax returns for the financial years 2016 and 2017.
He would have unprovoked his financial resources, which would have been due to the sale of Bitcoin, an electric coin, of 27 million, either willful or awesome carelessness.
The guilty should be the man for his conduct.
So the man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he agreed to sell electric coins for 27 million in 2016.
He would have had a grave in 2009 and 2010 when such things would have been both easy and unencumbered with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electricity coins, the tax would have been largely unclear and unpredictable because of such sales.
It would have been possible to expect public citizens to recognize such arrangements in a tax presentation.
He would not have avoided paying taxes from the harvest and would have recognized his property as a substitute for a tax bill.
He would have asked both the experts and the government’s tax administrator how this would be done but how it would not work.
Then he thought he would have to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and would have lived here for only a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in worse position than others to study complex rules that tax authorities would not have made clear.
Thus, the man rightly felt that his taxes for these two years would be remeasured and burdened, but otherwise no punishment would be imposed.
Then he withdrew from his job in Iceland and paid taxes here from 2012 onwards.
He had never intended to get away from his duties in an improper way.
The obligation of guilt would be out of the ordinary and would plunge him into debt.
Brønjölf comments: "This man understands what football is"
Andersen Willumsson's Brnolf has been considerably intertwined with people but has also been impressed by the progress of what is left of the Breiten moment in Pepsi Max.
Blinks will be in the fire line tonight when they receive the IA on live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
Then, for four reminders of the season, Brnolf takes out a ban and does not play with new clippings, as in the games of the summer.
He had “blah, blah, blah” written on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“ I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was more likely to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone going to equal this game then I thought he would do it or make it," said Gudmundur Benedictsson in the Pepsi Max booth, when it was considered to have arrived at Brynjölf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard sometimes to see what position he is in.
He looks a little out on the left when it starts to suffer the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Hafländason.
Thorkell Máni Petersson says Brynölf’s real entertainment and welcomes such a colorful person in the department: “No one argues that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and being always ready to show up and answer interviews.
It's incredibly busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“I am an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brnolf, people are paying themselves in and watching what is next to his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moon.
Player KR says he wants to leave the team - "I've been in contact with a couple of B-departments"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Soccer.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of the period in his native country, but to do so, he must first cancel his contract with KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic probability.
The company knows I miss Danmarks and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with a few members of the B-department and will probably change before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many people in Denmark who can allow themselves to pay up my contract with KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to make an increase in wages in Denmark.
"It is likely that companies in Denmark have felt more about the economic impact of the virus than they have in Iceland."
The Bicycle Whisperer Bjartmar has recovered a wheel for millions - Now answers for himself after a discussion of DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had interests in contrast with most others.
He smells and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and bags.
Björtmar has earned the name “the biker ” for this purpose.
Yesterday, as one published a report on one’s dealings with Bjartmar, there was a considerable shock.
DV then referred to the Facebook group of Westerners, where it was noted that Bjartmar had taken the man to speak on the Eastvelvel and said that his wallet could be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjortmar had known him as a thief.
These texts have now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Björtmar’s original news of the matter does not describe what really went on yesterday in the East.
He said that he had been told by a victim of electricity that these were indeed his electric guitars.
The information was misrepresentative, but the information proved incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I recognized the shuttle, with information that it was a very long - missed electric kitten that was looking for.
I hesitated, of course, first, but when I saw him preparing to drive on the shuttle, I decided to go and talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very well in such a case, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken away me."
Bjartmar says that the man at the electric school likewise invited him to show the receipt for the bicycle and called the police himself.
"Yes, great," said Bjortmar, "just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric school proved ownership of his electric school and started.
Later, as reported in the previous report, the owner of the electronic school told his story on Facebook.
In this bed of a year that Bjartmar has engaged in this practice, he says he can count the times that he encountered with people on one hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult men of Reykjavík, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that riders are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, fictitious, insane people, and other people for some reason on the street.
“The addiction is a tough master, and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, ” says Bjortmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I have a lot of the good people with me.
For example, people went to treatment and then looked at me and helped me do what I'm doing," he said.
As a general rule, Bjartmar’s dealings with wheelchairs are based on polite notes.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer him peaceably to show him the receipts, the parking lot number, and so on.
Bicycle stealing is a major problem that has been little discussed.
In addition, Björtmar says that police have even begun to point people out that they are talking to him because of stolen bicycles.
Bright people disagree with previous news coverage of DV and claim not to be a single-minded police force in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is still not on the heel of his activity, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar is sure to be.
“Of course the cops should do this, but the fact is that the cops are just not doing this.
I've been watching policemen drive away from a huge pile of stolen wheels.
She's out of her mouth in these matters. "
"When the police are not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this matter, then why not?" asked Bjitter.
He claims that he has achieved such a success in riding stolen bicycles that sometimes he encounters his “roarers ” on the street that they have only just received the Bjartmar bikes they had previously acquired.
The times that Bjartmar has called after the police's assistance have caused her simply not to show up.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the owner of the bicycles to blame,” said Bjartmar and regrets that victims of bicycle stealing have to suffer for the emptiness of the police in this case.
The results of Bjartmar are not shared.
There are many accounts of people who thank Bjartmar for having restored their possessions to them.
Björtmar himself says that he has long lost the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the heights are probably running on millions, if not millions.
It weighs electrical questions, electric bicycles, and electric bicycles, but electric bicycles can cost less than half a million.
Today, he works at a school and every other weekend in a community.
Thus, his bicycle hunt is unpaid work that he performs in his spare time.
Life insurance funds and long shadows
In 2019, there was a great year of birthday in the history of Iceland’s pension fund.
True, officials had received a retirement pension from King Dana from all the streets of the 19th century, but in 1919 an official’s pension fund was set up, which eventually resulted in the retirement of all public employees.
The foundation of the current public payroll fund was then laid with a comprehensive labour market contract in 1969, where a job-related pension fund with a compulsory and full - time fund from 1970 began.
Then, in 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements, and the ecosystem continued to grow.
The only radical change in labor movement of the 20th century was not the payroll system.
In 1955, unemployment insurance had been similarly received in historic strike events, as well as in gradual progress in the demands for health and sickness benefits, substantial leave rights, job cuts, house changes, and more as much as possible.
All these rights cost a great and severe battle, but they were found to be far greater and more permanent than the increase in the wage bill, which disappeared as hard as the heat of inflation, which marked the postwar period and until 1990 as many remember.
The contributor to the establishment of a public pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
In the final analysis, though, it was up to the unions to agree that their governments would be appointed representatives of employers and social partners.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the requirement for the majority of employees in the management of the funds was often discussed in the payroll organisations, but it never came true, and we still have the unusual arrangement that representatives of social partners are not in the majority of the governments of the funds.
Law No 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and on the operation of pension funds states that investment policy in the funds is to be considered.
The first article says that “a resource should be guided by the interests of partners. ”
The fifth section also states: “A life insurance fund will set itself moral standards in investments. ”
In the shareholder policy of the Consumers' Stock Exchange Fund, the following provisions are included, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions:
The United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest living resources and professional investments in the West and in Europe, are part of this budget.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance can contribute to the improvement of the investment performance of a stock exchange.
This brings together the interests of society’s investment and objectives in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those registered on the stock market, adopt a public policy: to maintain good governance in order to maintain a high level of social responsibility and environmental responsibility.
The National Reserve of Life, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself a policy of responsible investment, and there are similar provisions.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion term of Icelandic, “shadow - control. ”
Since the word is new in the matter, it is not hoped that it has been well defined, but I now see the following definition as being ‘most taken’: Shadow control is when a trade union leader says in the media that he is going to send recommendations or instructions to the representatives of the company in the management of an island fund.
If they fail to comply, they will be let go of the government at their first opportunity.
However, if the director does not take this to the media and does not speak of resignation, then it is not “shadow - control ” because such interaction is, of course, always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I allow the reader to reflect on how he feels “more shadowy. ”
There are in particular two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
There is a hard copy of the newsmagazine, and Ásgeir Jonsson, governor of the bank.
The reason for both was that Bogi Nils Bogason, president of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s contracts with air traffic controllers and airmen (to cancel them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of the Reykjavik Trade Association, sent them these recommendations to the company’s representatives in the management of the Shopkeepers’ Fund not to support the possible purchase of the funds on the partner’s shares, or they might be put to death.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Thor made the same recommendation, which, of course, reflected on Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw reason for the discussion on the subject in the Friday issue of the Journal with great words about shadow - control, law crime, and the need for changes in the law.
There a small dungeon would certainly have been toppling a heavy cavities, although blessed doves would have been in the way of annexation, and they would have been wiped out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the material itself at the end.
I spoke here before those points of the law on an island fund that is subject to this matter.
These include the need for government to safeguard the interests of social partners and to maintain moral standards in investments, and these are further elaborated in the agreement of both Gildis and the Consumer Life - Giver Fund, as I mentioned.
On the other hand, life insurance funds should NOT only look at short - term money investors in their investments.
Such a course would be extremely dangerous, and it does not have to be a long time to look for examples of such things in the past, since large bank loans and funds have led to immoral adventurers and environmental degradation, with disastrous consequences.
The head of Icelandair was obviously on ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus greatly detracting from the goodwill enjoyed by the partner in the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward investors.
Fortunately, he saw and pulled this back.
Time shows whether the investment of the partner’s pension funds can be considered responsible to the investors at the moment.

One of the infected did not accept a home Bible study
One of the three identified with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the land of the Baltic Sea on July 15, some one and a half weeks ago.
However, he was not regularly resident in Iceland, so he did not receive clear instructions to carry out so - called home disease after arriving in the country and to take another show a few days after arrival.
He got a negative scan at the border.
"But he's in an Icelandic community, and he's supposed to be in that department," says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a local medical specialist at the Land Doctor's Department, and during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the Newspaper today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number, and if the ID is not registered then you are not automatically announced in the later show."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but because of his connection with the land as an Icelandic, he should have used it rather.
However, he did not realize this.
“ When the teaching is not recorded, you need to apply for the second performance yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ Thus, it is clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to do an automatic preaching system, even though the Icelandic people do not register their teaching statistics.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are members of the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Happily, though, few people are associated with the arrival of the country, although it is defined as a member of the Icelandic community, a resident of Iceland.
Only six were sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday and all six of them were in contact with him.
They're going to show up, but two of them are starting to show the signs of Covid-19 infection.
On July 15, the man received negative results from his survey at the border.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected with the virus that she had not yet been able to detect in it when the test was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the possibility that the man has been infected here in Iceland but does not carry the virus to the country.
"It is not entirely possible to claim that this is a safe introduction because it is a long time ago that he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused little control in connection with the sports conventions."
It says, though, that it is very unlikely because of the small number of people around us.
“It is really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be ruled out until an Icelandic genetic analysis has sorted the human virus.
“If we get a virus type that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he carried it to the country.”
Piper Sprey and bombs used against protesters
An attack occurred between the police and Protestants in Seattle tonight.
The protesters used peppersprey and nonfatal bombs, but protesters broke the windows and set fire to fire.
45 protesters were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Law violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle supported protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one of the protesters was shot to death.
As the BBC reports, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building site and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
Thereafter, the protests were declared unbridled by the police, and there was a conflict between protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by the August police, was remembered by Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of officers of the Black National Guards met and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by a police officer in her home last March.
The group was armed with firearms and marched to closed street assemblies, where the police were related to the group of people who protested the protests and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white barn in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, football manager Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final round of English selection.
If the United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, the Sunskhar and his men in the 5th seat and thereby lose out of the Master's seat.
However, they should still hope to get to the Master’s Office by working in the European Union next month.
“We haven’t reached the end.
If we reach a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now," said Solskjær.
“But whatever happens, this isn’t the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to catch the two teams above us,” said Solskjær.
Clearly, the nerves of humans will be down at 5 p.m. today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that every other game was involved.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and it's where the partner is.
We've made a great opportunity to finish the season well and now it's ours to use it," said Solskjær.
“This isn’t the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important one.
The results do not define our period; we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ Bruno Fernande’s coming changed a lot for us, and I think we are in a better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last period,” said Solskjær.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coronary virus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed by the West Sea since the beginning of the epidemic there.
900 died from the virus yesterday than in the last four days until death from the virus was more than 1,000 a day.
A total of 146,460 viral deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the prediction of the U.S. infectious disease, the number of viral deaths will reach 175,000 August 15th.
Fear of a Second Wave of the Episode
The government of Spain is now trying to prevent the disease of an increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more have been reported in one day since May, and reports are coming at the same time as the Spanish begin to remove one of the most stringent bans in Europe.
The setback led the British authorities to require passengers from Spain to return home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is what is worse in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, where governments have taken on more extensive restrictions to try to match the growth rate.
In the capital of Barselóna, entertainment sites will be closed for the next two weeks and a wavehouses will be closed at midnight.
There is now an exit ban for 200 thousand people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is very angry at the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the epidemic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all flights scheduled today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to prepare themselves for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resuming a massive ban on exports that has devastated the economy in many lands.
For instance, British prime minister Boris Johnson has taken such things very badly and compared them to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, prime minister of France, has said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially, ” in the event of a national ban.
Many councillors hope that local resources that will reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or areas will be sufficient to keep the virus back in the next round if it arrives.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three nationally
Three domestic infections were identified yesterday as well as two in addition to the border.
Thus, five individuals with positive Covid-19 infection were identified last night in Iceland.
According to a general report, one infection is associated with the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football team.
He has been sent into solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him.
As part of the social work of a sports association in Reykjavik, the infected person is, according to the report, “only part of the sports team ” in the hospital.
Others who were sent to the hospital were related in a different way to man.
The source of this infection is undetected and infected in the full range of the National Police Department.
The ReyCUP conventioners have followed the guidelines and rules of the current and current medical and public safety authorities and have taken appropriate measures.
However, pictures of the convention last night attracted attention, where they could be seen in a very close association to celebrate their team’s good crowd on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, conventioners published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It reads “ATH: Parents, please, respect the rules for competitors to go to school for their own stuff.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection reported last morning.
Says the report: “Icelandic genetic analysis has sorted the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected before. ”
In this regard, it is also infected and 12 infected by the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was identified on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him for sickness.
Two of them are already showing signs of virus transmission.
In addition, two were identified at the border and are waiting for the results of further studies, such as a trajectory at the border.
Finally, the report states: The National Police Department and the National Police Department urge people to take care of and take care of personal protective equipment.
If there is any doubt as to the presence of the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, the same one is asked to be screened at the nearest health care centre.
Patrey's cable says the tent area is booked for the weekend of shops.
The tabernacle of the circuit is fully booked this weekend, according to a report from the West.
Visitors are advised to check other hostilities.
The names of the West Bildu Valley, Tálknáfjörð, Melanes in Red Sand, Hotel Flokalund, and Hotel Breiðavik as a second option in the situation.
There is enough to be on the patrimony of this weekend; for as in the first years, the city of Skäld, a festival of Icelandic documentarys is to be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
If the weather does not put a line in the bill, a good date can be expected from the tent site, but DV earlier said of a bad prediction.
But the worst weather southward, and the hope of the passoverers, may be expected.
The weaver bb.is first told us, saying that all other places in town were already fully booked.
A whole multi-storey house caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free in Dunhaga 18-20.
While property owners are looking for a permit to rebuild, their business has been covered in the system for the third year.
One of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods in the city of Reykjavik stands a magnificent three - story apartment building.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square feet [600 sq m] of shopping space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each holding four or so magnificent apartments.
They range between 93 and 130 square metres, although most of them exceed 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959, including a video store, a school room, a dairy store, a gunsmith, a fish store, and now a school portrait.
The house has remembered, to the point of being gentle, its fig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig-pig.
The house is now undergoing great damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 hf.
The owners of D18 hf. are listed among others by Magnus Magnússon and Godrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus was the owner of the Pay - up group and was a defender of the Pay - up Society.
Among the property owners of the Paying Company is Steelship Ehf.
The steel ship of the hf is the investment company of the Contra Saint Laur's daughter and her children.
Gudrun is also the owner of the third part of D18 hf.
Gudrun and her husband, Augustus Gudmundur the son of Sigurður, once carried out the steel ship.
D18 hf. bought the house in summer 2009 and has therefore not been maintained since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, most recently.
On a Facebook page in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house “did not have been particularly lively in the last year. ”
This may include the fact that owners have been seeking to change the house and place for several years.
Others say that the house has not been well for a long time.
“It’s a long time to do something decent about this spot, and it’s boring that it’s been so slow. ”
At the same time, he says he's messed up with the owner of the house because he didn't drive to finish it, found some common flat with the neighboring house, and stopped this “legislator. ”
“Just do this in consultation with the community around so that it can be done and done.”
The ‘Legal step’ referred to by the public is the organisational process of the field that has been under way at least since 2017.
They requested the owner of Dunhaag 18 and 20 to build a floor on the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a annex on one floor, along with a basement.
The building permit granted for this project was charged to the Environmental and Resource Committee and dropped it since the project had not been supported in a dispute structure and close-ups were not satisfactory.
Then the city of Smoky Bay began a dispute - organization work and finished it with an advertisement in the July Times of the Governing Body.
That organisation was also supported and dropped it by the Committee in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for building permits and the owner of the house at the starting point.
At that time, the house had suffered a great deal, and neighbors had grown weary.
When DV asked its neighbors about the situation and reactions of neighbors, the answers were various.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owner of the house, others not at all.
Others directed their anger toward the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing was necessarily to anyone.
Still others said that the parking lot was tight, but neighbors have a new unused parking lot Dunhaga 18 - 20 under their vehicle.
One plaintiff in the case said that he was tired of the administration:
“ If we have to go through the process for three years, it’s amazing.
It's like the city of Reykjavik couldn't read."
Today the house stands empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A monument to the floating phases of the city’s administration and noble intentions of the owner and many years of work of those who are now at the start.
When the newspaper was parked at Dunhaga, 18, a galloped door and a pile of garbage exploded to him.
Playstation computers and new television were lying around another garbage on earth — victims of Icelandic summer blackmail.
It was opened into the old office of the University Picture, where a lot of cats from whimsical smells were judged.
Clearly, someone has nestled in one corner, but no one is visible.
Letters of couches and beds, and several boards of earth - science pages that would no doubt become a book, were intriguing.
The stairs of the building were as open as life in both of them.
A reporter was so lucky to run into one of their own people.
There the Romanians ate a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The rooms work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some time, and D.V.'s accounts say the company paid nothing for the house but heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, rent is not a defence.
From the point of view of mail in the front door of the house, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the final miseries.
The operation of the labour market has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, as a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most efficient to use the service of the labour market.
Nevertheless, the Dunhaga 18 homes seemed to have enough to do, holding the workbells and wadings in the joint venture to dry up after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist offered the boys a bedrock call, the sarcasm suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square feet [1,500 square meters] of real estate is being demolished.
Owners want to change the house to improve and their neighbors want to improve the situation while sharing the definition of 'benefit'.
Between the city’s organizational fields, the victim of endless appeals and the potential for action in the organisational process and the suspended committees of environmental and resource committees.
In the house there are bedside workers, perhaps just those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelandics stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the July 17 issue of DV.
In response to a coronal epidemic of overweight
Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on quick - bit advertising, following a serious illness, partly because of its weight.
It says that Johnson introduces the campaign, which has been promised Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors are encouraged to prescribe bicycle rides for their clients in excess and are additionally attacked by the increase in bicycle riding.
Advertisers on television will then be banned before 21:00 p.m., as reported by the British media.
"COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risk of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthy food," said the chairman of the government.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was put into intensive care when he was infected with the Crown virus in the spring, and partly because of his weight, he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women Better to Lead to Change
She said that the new constitution was the greatest step that the nation can take toward greater distribution of power, transparency, and in working against corruption and for the benefit of the whole.
“ We need to change gear now, and each one is more likely to make such changes than the community that has easier to be in these values.
It's women," said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s cooperation.
To stand together and be united in making changes.
So now it's just time for us to lead these changes."
Said she was a little scary about Iceland’s emphasis as the “best in the world” in both sex stories and human rights.
“ Then we are not as willing to examine what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look into everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot of it.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of the border groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
In her inquiry, she said that women were in many good cases in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other places, the Icelandic people lived by immense masculinity.
She said that politics turned to form its own interests, authority, and powers that were the forces that maintained discrimination in all communities.
“ Women have now formed this group and come together and have become a little annoyed that Congress will move to look beyond this national bill from 2012, ” she said.
“ It’s this female value that we’re thinking about.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and the fact that we're all really sitting at the same table," she said, adding that the above mentioned values are the basic values of the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of naturalism, and it’s ridiculous that there are people who live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can trade differently," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s jobs are always lower.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses will have to stand in the battle forever just to get a decent salary."

Tried to rob a walking roadman in downtown
One man was arrested in the city center the night after he threatened a walking passerby and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árby, where two were arrested for the cause.
Then the police stopped the motorbike driver in the Hlides, where its driver was at 146 km [46 km], with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn overnight, and over 80 cases were listed in the police diary from yesterday to 5 a.m.
At that time, there was a lot of noise announcements about a party.
Saturday night there were reports of eleven noisy gatherings, and it was widely felt in the police journal.
Tonight, however, 22 noises were voiced at police level.
Six were stored in a prison cell last night.
In the town of Árby, police were called to the night when the people shot fireworks on the air.
However, they had escaped when policemen came into the garden.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped before drunkenness and or drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city center during the night, one of which was stored in a prison cell.
Then two were transferred to an emergency reception after they fell on their faces, one in the city center, and the other in the Western town.
One was transferred to an accident department after he was injured in jumping on trampoline in Copavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a trailer at Kjalarnesi yesterday.
The trailer was, according to the police’s diary, in “very bad condition ” and was stationary.
You can stay in Monet's house for the holidays
The house, in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice, is now available for rent on the Airbnb page.
The next night in the house is the weekend for the merchants.
The house is small and adorable, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone is planning to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on the Airbnb page, it is next free after week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, and therefore might be the perfect choice for some shopkeepers on vacation to book the painting’s house.
The two nights of a store weekend cost no more than 964 U.S. dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic dollars after the next newsmagazine.
Tens of the pathogens and some of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronary virus
Five have been diagnosed with the siron virus domestically during the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Because of this, dozens of them have been infected, and some of them have begun to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the siron virus domestically yesterday and two at the borderline.
According to a surgeon’s office expert, growing numbers of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into society.
“ It’s been sorted from the first domestic infection, and there’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think it’s gone into society for some time.
This is probably something that has recently come to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla, the daughter of Joseph, a regional health expert.
Most of them have been associated with aliens.
Further inspections are carried out in the near future, but some of those associated with those infected are starting to show the symptoms of the coronary virus.
“Now there’s no flu going on and other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal about doing these tests on people who have found a reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Immunisation is mostly complete, but there is no possibility that more people will have to be infected.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sports events.
It has raised questions as to whether holding such events can be justified.
The general manager says that it is slow as long as people follow standards and regulations.
Kamilla says that the infected have been infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there is no more isolation from these individuals after associating with them at these sports conventions, we can say that our conventions have worked.
But it hasn't been revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Public Protection Department is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with any further advice or limitations if it seems justified,” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, a thousand people will be cleared of a number of restrictions.
This new situation could influence the approach.
"Despite meditation on cooking" - See the menu of Elisa Vidar
Elisa Vidarsdóttir is an accomplished footballer who plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, mother, and serves as a food specialist.
It takes a lot of energy for the day’s service and usually gives it time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day starts with a job from eight," says Elisha.
“After work, I go to the camp to prepare my dinner before I pick my girl up at the theatre at 3:00. ”
Elisha finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in school.
“ It’s good to spend time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After practice, it's good to come home and just warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our mind."
There is no particular diet for Elisha.
She is putting her final hand on a nutrition tract and is well aware of what is suitable for her eating to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercise.
“ What’s right for me is to eat a wide variety of foods that are well made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
However, I feel that it is most important to keep in healthy contact with food and not to include food in bad or good, rather nutritious, or nutritious food.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I think there’s some thought about standing in the kitchen cooking and getting a lot of it.
I have to say that my confidence is in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seed, hemp seed, salt, a little lemon juice, left in almond milk overnight.
Top of this meal with what exists every time.
Usually it's banana and it jumped musli & kaffi.
I'm a big cupcake.
Intermediate: Unbelievably different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, a clean shirt with bananas and mussels, bread with berries, and so I could eat hummus with a spoon out of the trunk if that is the case.
lunchtime: I often make all kinds of high - food salads from things that exist in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafelballs, rock salads, overgrown vegetables with good dressing, is something I’m working with.
If the organization gets completely out of hand (which often happens) then the egg machine at work has caused me a lot to save, and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and soaked eggs, no more laying on you.
Intermediate: Give me something carbohydrate for exercise, cakes, breakfasts, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often selected in my home, or some delicious vegetable dishes.
A conflict between police and Protestants in Seattle
Civil authorities in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., have declared a state of rebellion following widespread protests in the city center.
Yesterday, police took hold of bombs and pepper sprays to tempt a large area conquered by Protestants and reached over many lengths of houses in the vicinity of the city’s Assembly Hall.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that an investigation was carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that the Protestants stoned the police with rocks, bottles, whale bombs and other loose and that one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were given the blueprint to show solidarity between Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where there has been a violent attack in the city between Protestants and heavily armed federal police forces.
There, like in other cities in the United States, people gather under the names of Black Lives Matter, remember Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protests systematic racism in American society and demands compensation.
Not revoked until after receipt of an invitation
There is still no question of cancelling the resignations of the flight attendant Icelandair, scheduled to take effect at the next month’s convention.
An electronic vote on Iceland's airline agreement on behalf of an airline girl at Icelandair ends tomorrow at noon.
The president of the Society assures Godlaud Liney St. John’s daughter that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the conclusion of the vote is reached.
"It's definitely hanging together," says Gudslaud Liney.
“ There have been no cancellations, so this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people are reluctant to know if they will have a job after the month."
The price is for a contract signed a week ago, during July 19th.
It is assumed to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract that had previously been awarded by flight attendants.
On July 17th, the Icelandic Air Traffic Management Board agreed to announce a full-time job stop at Icelandair, which was agreed by the members of the Board of Directors.
It never came to her, but this was decided upon following the decision of Icelandair to discontinue discussions with the airline company, cancel all his airline wives, and search for contracts with another union.
At that time, the company’s pilots were to take on the work of shipwreck crews temporarily.
Asking how she feels that the vote will go, Gudlaud Liney says that it is difficult to say.
“People are wounded by this move to Icelandair, when all the airline families were dismissed and announced that they would be signed with another union.
It turns out that it has an effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair, where 900 of them, about 95%, were terminated.
Their release is great; he is three months with those who are the shortest of them, and ends at the month of July.
In that group, there are about 90% of airline girls in Icelandair.
What will the contract not be approved?
“ Then we wished for further discussions with our fellow believers.
With this deal, we're meeting Icelandair's requirements.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far."
A vote on a nuclear agreement will be closed and Icelandair will announce another quarter tomorrow.
Missile vote on a new treaty will end at noon tomorrow.
The compilation of Icelandair for another quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results suggest that the company’s income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic ballot fee for the Iceland airline agreement and the Icelandair Business Meeting began on Wednesday, July 22, and will end tomorrow, on Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those who have the right to vote for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay social security contributions to the Refugee Society.
On Sunday, July 19, Icelandair and FFI signed a new core agreement on Sunday, but on Friday, Icelandair had broken discussions with the partner after the flight attendants had concluded a previous agreement on a vote at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airlines and airliners of the company on Friday, but they were pulled back after a new deal was signed.
According to a new agreement, flight attendants need to fly five hours more a month before the same basic fee.
The treaty dates back to 2025, where pilots have been brought together and flight attendants have been allowed to fly on one watch for how long.
The agreement was introduced to FLI’s associates at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, describing many flight details that were discussed by a news agency about their dissatisfaction with the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement would have to be approved in order to keep the FIFI alive.
The issue of Icelandair for another quarter will be presented tomorrow, but the EBIT company, its financial and tax operations, is down by 100 to 110 million US dollars, or about 15 billion US dollars, according to preliminary export results.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Kauphälten during the last Wednesday, where it said that the company’s income was about $60 million in the quarter, or about $8 billion.
At the end of the quarter, about a billion dollars have been spent by the United States alone.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair is planning to conclude contracts with the 15 governments, the government, and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of a month before the partial air traffic.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“ A new virus simply means that it has been an individual who came from abroad.
It's not something that's been grinding around here,' says Már Kristjánsson, head doctor at the National Hospital's infectious disease department, who reports that "a new type of virus" has been diagnosed here in the country.
Three domestic outbreaks were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who had been diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports association at the Rey Cup ’s soccer tournament, but the source of the infection is unknown and infectious.
Infection was also detected in a person who came to the country on July 15 and two who were in contact with him began to show signs of COVID-19.
Last night, infection related to infection reported in the previous day and following a serial analysis in the Icelandic genetic analysis was identified as “a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before. ”
Infection is complete in connection with this infection.
Mothers report that they are not new viruses but are the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new Saronian virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what that means and whether it might say something to the effect that another wave of epidemics has begun, Mär says that as there is a single incident, there could be nothing more to it.
“However, if there are cases of a foreign-disconnected country with the same genotype as this particular variant, the conclusion [at the second wave] could be drawn, but it is premature to do so,” explains Már.
Happiness in the Hot Pot
Is the secret to the happiness of Iceland hidden in the hot pots?
BBC programmers lead to the likeness of a fun video that sheds light on the country's pool and hot pottery culture.
Icelandic baths are unique in the world, and no one in the world claims to be the same number of baths per inhabitant.
The natural soil is the foundation of it, but it is also the standard for the bathing that prevails here.
In 1940, children’s abortion was legalized, but older citizens are still able to use their hot water for their health.
Dizziness is described as a fixed part of the country’s general well - being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
According to the mobile phone, people talk about their home and space in a personal way or enjoy the graceful power of the water: they think and load the batteries of the soul and body.
Should the bar pick up a hundred days in the election
There are hundreds of days until the Americans go to the elections and choose presidents until four years of age.
Donald Trump is looking for reelection, but he has to go to the barn.
Joe Biden, the prospective candidate of the Democratic Party, has a great advance on Trump on the national level, taking into account the polls.
According to a new survey conducted by the AP news service, the United States has a high rate of misrepresentation of the nation.
In addition, Trump’s pandemic response to the new coronary virus is very unpopular, and more Americans believe that the president has held economic affairs badly before.
More specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has kept a good economy.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveTirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 per cent nationally followed by Trump 41.9 per cent.
Trump himself has tried to bring attention from his attitude toward the epidemic to Biden, to promote so - called cultural strife, and to proclaim policies that are to turn to law and order.
Biden’s presentation, however, makes a great effort to keep Trump’s attention focused on the possibility of winning if the election really revolves around what Trump has done in the last four years.
It seems that unpopular Trump is also planning to attack the members of the Republican Party and fear that even the majority of the U.S. Senate elders who have been very eroded here could be reached by the Democrats.
Polito told of the day’s keeping up with groups and suppliers comparable, and that is now what the Republic group would experience for decades.
In the 2016 Congressional Elections, the local community has been particularly badly affected, and it now looks as if this development will continue.
Trump, in recent days, has tried to scare the inhabitants of the suburbs into following him, including by saying that he will be President Biden, he will destroy the U.S. suburbs and promote racial conflicts.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a rule from Barack Obama’s time in the White House, which was designed to increase the diversity of the suburbs.
He then urged the “housewives ” of the U.S. to read an article by former assistant director of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and accept Trump.
“ The waiting will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
The U.S. population is an ever - increasing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority vote for this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
The survey findings have shown that despite the fact that the majority of Trump’s involvement in the districts of 2016 has been very limited.
Although there are differences between the probes, Biden has measured about fifteen percent of Trump’s premise in the excursions recently.
Regis Philbin is dead
U.S. TV player Regis Philbin is dead, 88 years old.
Philbin served as an actor, director, entertainer, and singer for some six decades.
He is one of the best known for controlling the popular games Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 together with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
Then he has managed things like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent most hours on U.S. television and has been recognized by him.
He received six Emmy awards on a job interview and was nominated 37 times in total.
It is stated by his family that Philbin died of natural causes.
Many collaborators, friends, and fans have mentioned him on social media the last day.
Will Olympic Fire Be Light at the End of the Gangs?
After a final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have brought to fruition, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympics would be famous as “the light at the end of the corridors, ” indicating the world’s now - going carbon dioxide, which the world’s population is going through in unity.
Africans have years more to prepare, and Japanese authorities are adding costs to the delay.
Everyone, however, has a lot to do with his head.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the cheers of Japanese representatives were real.
They cried and laughed at each other, for Tokyo had applied for the 2016 games, but they bowed down in lower ranks for Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan would bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled for 24 July to 9 August, but they were postponed for a year, starting on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If you do not manage to keep the games, the games will be aborted if you do not have them.
Yet, no one wants to think that way to the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be amazing and strive to top the last game.
The city chosen for the Olympics is based on the opinion of the Election Committee of the City’s presentations.
The grander the presentation — the more likely it is to be given.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to win the 2016 Olympics, or more than $20 billion.
A second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about $10 billion, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo was given the games this year, the Japanese authorities had a budget of $30 billion for the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean, depending on how much it takes to build Olympic villages, stadiums, and, in general, to strengthen the land’s interior to handle such conventions, to prepare them, and to hold the games themselves.
Governmenters in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympic Games, which were scheduled to run these days but have been postponed for about one year because of the Coronary Virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a government correspondent in Japan that came out at the end of the last year revealed that the cost was more than twice that.
While the cost of delaying games may not be fully assessed, it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee, and Japanese taxpayers could run from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so many figures that at the lowest possible cost, all the taxes of the Icelandic State were only about half the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games are an event of the magnitude that they have often become a topic of discussion among economists, who try to discern numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the short run, it seems that many people have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are as positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
For example, a small number of jobs are very short - lived, but for a longer period of time, cities tend to be in debt and the fear - inspiring cost of small - scale jobs.
Rio, Brazil, has been heavily indebted to the 2016 games and has been in trouble at the cost of maintaining all the major sporting activities built for the games.
After the 2012 London Games, only 10 percent of those who received a job related to the Olympic Games in the city have been found to be unemployed before.
This means that there was no new job but to a small extent.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in holding the Olympic Games financially because of the sloppy cost of the human creations built for the games.
However, it is often considered that there is an increase in the traffic of travelers who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, but there is a great deal of uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether to accept all the number of spectators who usually pick up the games.
The main thing, though, is the honor that the cities have to be chosen, but it is difficult to appreciate for money.
Thus, in spite of the enormous cost, it may also be said that the joy that the games bring is not that it can be put on a price.
Of course, while the show is often magnificent, and there is nowhere to save, it is not just about money.
It's the athletes who are in the foreground.
To some outstanding people, it's only a surprise to delay the games.
For example, in his article on the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, the Australian five - year - old and gold prize winner, Chloe Esposito, is a Catholic and would have been far from a good joke in summer, but with the hope of being in the 2021 matches.
So it is among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning, in some cases, that they quit the race before the games took place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years of rigorous exercise.
Few athletes were equally impressed with the hearts of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio and Simone Bile’s gymnast.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play 2021, but she's not sure she'll be at the top of the games next year, and she'll be 24 then.
Although it is generally not considered to be a high age, it is superior to a female gymnast in the front row.
“This is a sensitive subject,” Biles says, but smiles in another interview, which was published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee, asking if she is going to get as far as 2021 and she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’ll be on top for another year, ” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body cannot cope with the stress of gymnastics for much longer.
Nevertheless, she is a champion for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that when the pandemic was at its highest and the gym was closed, it was a uncomfortable feeling to stop suddenly.
There were no exceptions for Bile’s rather than others during seven weeks of closure of all sports activities.
All her Olympic gold could not buy access beyond the others, and she had to find ways to stay in shape, as did others.
Certainly, the basic form is a little better than for most people.
“We have a tight schedule now.
It was hard to start rehearsing first after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back on track, and I'm going to expand my practice as well as ever after what's going on in the year.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like or whether they will be held, but we still practice according to their future, cannot do anything else.
I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," says Biles.
With it, as with others, there is no doubt or perhaps more awareness that the situation can arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
But predicting that is hopeless.
In July 2021, no one can know what the situation in the world epidemic of the Corona virus will be like, and nothing else can be done, but prepare for the Olympic Games on the assumption that they will be held in the year.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covid gangs.
Delayed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone his wedding because of the coronary virus.
She was to marry the ex-Bachelorette champion Wells Adams this summer.
“I think it’s other more important things to think about right now,” said the actress in conversation with People.
“ We’d like to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and all those who care about us.
But we decided to delay and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I'm looking at more world affairs than wedding deals these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
