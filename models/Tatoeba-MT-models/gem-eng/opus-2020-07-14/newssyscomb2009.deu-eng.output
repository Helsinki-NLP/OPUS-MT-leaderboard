Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
A marked weakening of both parties in the previous great coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the preferred parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer stands on the Kippe.
In contrast, the election leader of the alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, prepares for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but against the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially of the People's Party, which had requested the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had resigned from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
The electorate, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman and vice-chanzler Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most probable way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to renew the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
Given the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - but at the same time expressed its fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had agreed with the populist parties (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it had split from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already declared that he is willing to cooperate with each party, is obviously putting this development on hold and starts from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also moved into Parliament, but suffered slight losses and, among the Austrian political parties, dropped from the third to the fifth place.
No other party probably won the four-percent-thirty and therefore did not move into Parliament either.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India of the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't work out, then sure, then there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executive could hardly intervene.
After all, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted from the charge and received a fine that would be applied to central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years imprisonment, it would be best for Mukherdshi to go to court at a higher institution.
He could thus seek release for bail and be free to wait for his judgment, according to the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also spoken in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question to him," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to suggest "competent legal support" to the convicted, the Indian minister suggested.
At the same time, he said that such help was already being offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, he reaffirmed the Czech Republic's importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question as to whether the Indian side had given the undertaking to deal with the matter, the minister left.
"I have already been promised quite a lot," he said.
A Czech judge over the ringing around the seabed
It appears on an electronic map showing Australia and adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it.
Work and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed has so far been a little known world, rich in natural springs.
Here oil can be found, ore and other non-regenerative raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which carry the key to developing a cancer medicine.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the Anrain states submitted their claim to the new seas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, on which they agreed in Montego Bay in 1982 on Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplified, as continental shelving is considered to be the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the surface of the sea.
It crosses the boundaries of the Sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the Commission's country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated over five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three latter countries have been successful", Mikulka adds.
A recent international echo came up with Australia's success, which was the first country to be able to significantly increase its sea areas.
But also New Zealand is a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will flow to them from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Further countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area, which is called "common heritage of humanity" by the Convention begins.
No state has any special position here.
The right to promote in this field shall be granted to an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold grave ground," says director Mikulka with some exaggeration, adding that "the individual areas were legally defined and the system was contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991 it received the status of a so-called "rail-breaking investor" because of the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be surveyed by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatras on the seabed.
"You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary sham that the legend after the golem has brought to life.
German Special Forces were on site for hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help to resolve the hostage crisis from Germany - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come for use.
More and more details are being known in the circumstances of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, the rescue operation involved German special forces indirectly.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and GSG 9 officials were the Fliegerstaffel of the Bundespolizei, the Bundescriminalamt and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Office at the place of liberation.
However, as ministers reported further on Monday evening, German forces were not required because hostages ran and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had adopted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Unfortunately, that's not what happened," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19, in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged to and fro in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
Until last, the identity of hostages remained unclear as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescuers have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were in the care of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "picture" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special staff will be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House Refused Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones sprang to the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US representative house has rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which chaos should be curbed in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called for agreement, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The reason were investors' concerns that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure was made known, he collapsed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans' desire to travel remains unruly.
When booking for the winter season, the travel offices recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales plus of travel agencies for October amounted to around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the entire market.
The travel bookings were made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the USA was particularly required, the DRV announced.
Here the booking growth was around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local population, are particularly sought after by the Germans.
In particular, vacation tours are high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the costs for the customer would be better calculated than for individually organised holidays.
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that there would be a revenue increase again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time in October
Ballermann-Apres-ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liter-krügen and promis in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronsucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She's blond, she's a TV host and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Within three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already falling upon us and snapping the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the white-wortstätrator, the well-being in the dress remained limited to date.
But once on the Theresienwiese, everything is half that bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks objectionable or embarrassingly touched - all completely normal.
Odd glances at the Chocolate Banana stand only reap my Dirndl aprons.
A Munich woman would draw my attention to the fact that I had incorrectly bound the apron: "lefts hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back wetwet."
Secretly, I take the loop from the back to the left.
"Take care," said it and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and extends to an unsolicited naked butt.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who comes from England and also attends the October Festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn "oooooo".
He tells me that after he clears his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage dumpster.
So Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbiesler."
Others are not fortunate to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, sanitizers run across the square, which needs to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered suit from tent to tent.
It works as with most meadow visitors: Empty down, fully back again.
Whoever's in the promille sarge under the plane, you can't see.
"These are the ones where goarmerers pack," one of the sanitizers called to me on request and disappeared in the mud.
Name of the accident victim notified by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of suspicion of loathsome driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platform with a tower on every corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is crumbling.
But once you're inside the curved ticket switch, there's no doubt about the generosity of the project, whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a latecomer in the imperialist game, had before implementing its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist projects were paralysed during World War I.
His railroad rails were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammo train flew into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly decayed, far away from history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling Party of Justice and Development, the ACP, has introduced a vaguely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key dates of this new foreign policy, I have climbed the night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, Turkish MEP Suat Kiniglioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same pace of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new worldly state project, to return to the backs of the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has taken me to the AKP headquarters, a specially manufactured, state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniglioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is now to integrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exceptional occurrence," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "would not have to make this decision."
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone with whom I was speaking said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, can drive Europe as a whole on the right rail eastern direction Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised she would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
And when I was waiting at the stopover for the ferry that was supposed to bring me back over the bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir "Tod" Handley (after 11 September).
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years old, but when the 1979 choir was singing for the last time, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) was for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chores was often astonishing, always exciting, and only existed thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never went down for years.
How often did death stop us from "letting music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never mastery, but never superfluous.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply "goed home with one or two known marshes in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your wake for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research grant in 1950 ... while he was studying for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate at the same time.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Jensets von Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as the British rubber industry.
In 1950-1951 he was in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Leben' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They made me attentive to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments."
Second round of outstanding sales at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large room limo offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical fines that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel saving.
Changes prior to the forthcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this big limo are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be emphasized.
However, before you start to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation of jazz appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less known, this model is a phenomenon of its sale in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Even so, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10,000 cars. This is 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has since 2002 sold a total of 8 000 jazz models, which is 6.7 % of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the branch heads in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows the sale reduction to be hidden in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22,000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It's insight, a five-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is foreseen for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new spatial flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading space system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-litre gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and at the same time provides torque-intensive power for the entire engine run time.
The first variant with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 max torque turns of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, he now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the technical development center of the Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the research center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important thing is the facet eyes of the bees, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, allowing them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles located at a distance of up to two metres in front of the BR23C and in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance up to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a signal for avoiding collision.
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even larger angle to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this deviation is absolutely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither turn up nor down, but can not overground; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to turn his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotational function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to prevent the collisions of the small robot.
`This device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act on this information.
It does not require to store either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the disk space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite, in order to lead up to the target while driving, avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's trembling before she's hit with a mortgage.
It must be seen that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not in a position to do so.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid US citizens becoming involved in mortgage history of supposedly paying banks, a entertaining and informative game was developed for the Internet surfers: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the `hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Of course it has useful information, but without details.
This is more a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the start of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and so take over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been published, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley tribes at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total of three billion dollars.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share's price of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, dropped by 6.79% against 17.00 GMT to 23.07 dollars.
`This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which should enable him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply explained that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
`A week ago', in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, we thought that participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and safeguard ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction of profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged over more than 50% over the sale value within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money delivered by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
A press representative of the group, however, refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a cash-flow ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that he had reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their stock exchange price dropped by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity went up.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic of the 21st century's socialism is being re-founded.
This is the joint project of Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorialian Rafael Correa.
The third was the one who followed this Sunday, the example of his like-minded and friends, the plan of a new constitution.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results of 80% of voters, 64% voted 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted with `No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, one vote must be achieved in more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday two polls conducted at the exits of the polls and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for `Yes', and it was predicted 63% to 70%.
By the way, during the night from Sunday to Monday Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorials.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelorette.
The election, held in silence in accordance with the OAS, was based on a 444-point text to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The Constitutional Project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it with the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives most of the oil promotion by foreign companies and by the foreign currencies, which sends expedients to the country.
The project, driven forward by Correa, chosen in 2006, will also allow the head of state to exercise more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, she also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were liberated in Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the captors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning, they were liberated from an Egyptian command.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza right next to Cairo's international airport at 15.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers, 'there was no ransom paid', explained Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the roll field.
After being captured on September 19 at an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from a hiding place by 35 unknown deportees.
They are 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night shortly before dawn.
`On both sides shots and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest of them fled', said this responsible one who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support through German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently located, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We have to acknowledge that thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men, we have achieved this result from the secret service and the special units,' he explained without further details.
He also disputed that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the evening, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road patrol vehicle in which the kidnappers were found, of which they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which however immediately contradicts this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on funding culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
That's better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise and call upon the pitiful sums that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that starve to death?
What politician will it dare to remind the Federal Government that they neglect their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing EUR 3.5 million for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
With our American neighbours, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MEPs and all governmental circles, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 honorary officials, gathered in 211 historical societies, strive to deal intensively with history, save with a few large ones the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair, when sponsors and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments Governments of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three states provide EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted on the highest level on the weekends, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition authority’s representative.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell some of its holdings, primarily the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The Fortis shares started a steep valley last week, in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already taking place.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a crime.
The institution's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year period.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group's market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is a debt to the valley route of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses have slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interest in a material offer.
The Belgian government, however, was concerned with calming down - no investor is supposed to charge for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been upset.
In Hungary, the Fortis has separate branches, but it also has its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in the number of chickens
Because of a person's drug consumption, life and health insurance in America often refuses to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox to the chickens" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees and payments in the event of damage depending on the customer's state of health and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: using the customer's identification number, he is referring to the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are non-negotiable, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurances only have to do more with the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraines and hot flushes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer's point of view, while the above is not.
For the querying and processing of the data, individual companies have formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been notified.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and connect them with the data on drug consumption, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
While there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been presented to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prevent access to his data, as the insurance companies otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to some extent the grace of the fox.
Global dining plan in Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue, alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian Summit is also taking place, in which mainly cooperation in the nuclear sector is discussed.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic major power, which should be given more voice and say more in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth Marseille Summit.
The French President and current President-in-Office of the Council Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to over EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the trade in goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that in the future air transport will also be flown.
India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked nine among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the terrorism which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also adjudicated.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, both sides of which are to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, i.e. that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to close a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India is visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are hoped.
According to Agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for right-wing acquisition.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits the current event of more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will distribute over 171,790 square metres of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the room structure will follow at the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sections.
A year ago, the billionaire Steve Fossett's small aircraft disappeared.
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which disappeared on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was discovered.
The parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m height, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
Madera County's sheriff, John Anderson, completely removed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a crew has been sent out. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) indicated that just a few hours after the aircraft was sighted a team was sent out identifying the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab that was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett started a 3-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Finally, in California, near the border with Nevada, some of the personal items from Fossett were found from a couple near their home to Mammoth Lakes.
These are two IDs with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he was the first man to surround the world ball in a hot air balloon in the sixth race: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover on a plane.
Among its numerous records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that falls from the conventional schemeta through its original design and the special lineing, the discharge surface and its clear angle.
With this offroader, Mercedes-Benz tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Especially because of its exceptional characteristics, the idea of the Suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October onwards.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort that will be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, where 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como will give a special look to the whole: the new Suv will thus appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details in different moments to reconstruct it as a whole.
Without a doubt, the concern of Mercedes with this advertising is to introduce a new kind of autoclave in this rather stereotyped field.
Is it possible, however, to interest the future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk the ban on stadiums
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been travelling since years of the Italian national team and which, frankly, until recently did not cause serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The group's origin is in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, there were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia.
They carry the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 cards available to Italian fans for the game: all were displayed by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: no one travelled to Sofia with a running stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-committed in this respect, were thus refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect at least five years' ban on stadiums.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans are no longer going to put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation cities, which could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire has to be released immediately, and there is no way of justifying such behaviour," says the Viminal.
That's why "eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio (sports supervision) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
While it is true, Mazzilli says that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the duce, it certainly was a disgrace to these 150-200 people.
"I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are committed in the land of their actions.
So far, this group had been bluffing, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the whistles during the hymn Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but allow me, because there is no education ...".
