Gutach: Even more security for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: on Tuesday, the new B 33-foot ramp at the village parking lot has been put into operation in Gutach - in view of the older town hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or citizenship?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall lamp was installed at that time because it saved the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel ensures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße junction.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian rise, there had to be another traffic light for their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the County Council of Offenburg.
"The municipality of Gutach, approximately ten percent of which are heavy goods vehicles, operates on the B 33 daily, emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simply a priority here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, also a roundabout was considered, but due to the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was rejected again.
According to Arnold, everything has been tested before in the selection of the traffic lights: "In the middle of an extra one for us with particularly long wooden trunks of loaded transporters, we have tested whether these vehicles can travel out of the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without turning around the traffic lights".
The approximately 15 000 Euro-priced traffic light plant itself is the "most modern thing that exists on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which are so powerful that the lights of the motorists can be easily recognized, for example, even at the depths of the sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is clear, immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the car driver had to think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: the traffic lights for pedestrians were green, a top-class vehicle ran through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the fading of raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner award winner is known mainly as a prose author, theater lyrics are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresaker presents a collage of prosatexts for his performance "Wetterlampen auf der Zungenspitze", which is now visible in the Garage X at Petersplatz.
The Theatermacher combines some elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family belauerend" (2003).
On the largely empty-spaced stage - important requisitment: a tangled sofa, on which obviously copulates and masturbates - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresaker seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a wealth of directorships, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
Above all, the actresses are involved in the sometimes questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their head under water, plucked to the wall with their evening robbers.
Forced into cellophane or bobbin, they stick to dangerously high piles through the stage, either monologue them loudly or lie completely stunned on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
Only towards the end does the overcrowded performance come to rest, and Winkler’s aftertaste of absurd humor flashes.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying Highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that takes place on the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups and advocated that the government use the small boxes to record the traffic kilometers – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax documents.
The tea party is upset.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a procedure, several states no longer wait.
They are currently examining how they can switch over to a system over the next ten years in which drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we can only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles in all California car drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paid by the US-Americans on the Zapfs column, is pleading.
But in America no more is thought of as much as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax at high prices, even to raise a cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable", says Lee Munnich, an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This represents the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is heard by urban liberals, for for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
The Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state on climate change.
However, Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees the most common long-term alternative in it.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also given the idea of having drivers pay by distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason's Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in a 2011 report asked the Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would include 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the initiative and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who often have to spend many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
However, several states and large cities are moving on their own in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the Transport Ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"Threats against Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test was carried out, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that now look for affordable technology with which the state can record the traffic kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
So, according to Khan, the public would also be calmer.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company has originally not started to help states tax car drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles driven.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," explained Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes.
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not select any equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate on the basis of the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a taxing device that also pays parking fees, an insurance only has to be paid for driven kilometres and speed data are collected from other vehicles in real time thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Autodrivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-time charge or an annual charge could be imposed on hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Little team beats itself waker
The volunteer fire brigade managed its autumn main test despite personnel shortages with bravour.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate in Burgberger Strasse in his practice.
There's supposed to have been a short cut in sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the facts by Hans Kammerer, two ventilators of the weather prepared to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, since there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were still electrical machines for woodworking.
The first fire attack took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line took place via an over-floor hydrants about 100 meters away.
Three delete attacks could now be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also concerned with showing what to achieve with little staff available.
In serious cases, there is support via the Königsfeld daily deployment group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtagspräsident Guido Wolf was also able to clarify in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow came from.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald he examined this important issue together with the business leaders of the professional schools as well as the circular gymnasium and the chairperson of the parent advisory board.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma school, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation in the forest city between the funding centre, the district gymnastics centre and the vocational school centre.
He also praised family kindness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a view of the family phase, but also the phase of demographic change to care for relatives," Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were concerned with the care and care of their family members.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies often retain their knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Landtag proved convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Stay firm and ensure that public transport improves," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
Experience a entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dieting Seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly were accommodated in the restroom.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, lived with common melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as a pre-delimitation of the old school yard to Kirchstraße, which is before the renovation, is to be re-established on the renovation cost plan of the city of Brünlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig a small corner wall was installed during the first works of the renovation of the front school yard, for stabilizing and static relief of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Brünlinger Stadtbauamt, Alexander Misok has planned to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the plans and create a refurbishment concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts, who will then be put on the table to the council for decision and further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, plastering and tree planting of the old school interior courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary, in due course, to take a follow-up measure that has to be renovated from scratch to refurbishment.
The historic, one-hundred-year-old wall of the old school yard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, needs renovation and has a bending to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
The school courtyard renovation was originally planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned spending brought about a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for film photography, will be spoken by the State Monument.
If standards come from this side, then the city of Brünlingen hopes for subsidies from the monumentists.
The students of the Brünlinger primary school, who are now being trained again in a well renovated old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined forces.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart Musikhochschule," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong at the jazz location of Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, Jazz and Pop will be transferred from Stuttgart University of Music to Mannheim University of Music.
U.S. border: "Super tunnel" discovered to be a drug smuggler
At the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities reported, the more than 500 meter long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rails and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been put into service.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through the radar," said U.S. District Attorney General Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered an end of the tunnel.
Duffy, who turned to the drug gangs, assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous fight against the drug cartel.
Since 2006 more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place for about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with maximum sentences for lifelong withdrawal, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug trafficking in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
There were no details of the prisoners, at least one of them being Mexican, called it.
You have to count up to ten years with prison sentences.
2014 Becoming Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is drawing ever closer.
When the year comes to an end in about eight weeks, the anniversary year begins.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time 794.
In churches, a document was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this start-up event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
During the anniversary several events are planned both in Geisingen, as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
Church Houses will be 1250 in July on a weekend of July 18 to 20.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
This weekend is also the church-housen festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote for the city on the occasion of the anniversary an order composition that is listed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This is finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last week of September, on 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will also be released on the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee.
"But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but of today's Geisingen, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geisingen celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 today's space was carried out with the communities.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many jubilees.
The Naarrenzunch Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a wedding evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and will have the banquet on March 29th and then celebrate the district music festival from May 1st to May 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a certificate of gift, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was produced in churches (houses), which was a court of law at the time.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate 2014 this 1250-year-old accordingly, in addition, the community reform is also 40 years ago.
Council takes track systems to its sights
Should the crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councils decided.
Schiltach must take in the hands of 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings is to be increased - on a regular basis there are collisions between trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must participate with a third in the costs, the rest in terms of the railway and the federal government.
Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the characteristics of the Bah crossing "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a reservation at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting long timber, could also be on counter-roads without having to block the tracks.
Therefore, he proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could spread the road in due time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for road traffic: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought the opinion of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" was regularly used for long-wood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area was partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also be important for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to examine the cost of the proposed road diversion.
Notwithstanding this, the conversion of the railway crossing was agreed by majority with the condition that the necessary supporting wall is built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road direction "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to around 5.5 meters if necessary.
The conversion of the train crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could, on the other hand, draw on a completely different problem regarding access to the rapidly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the railway conversion plans examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser road was then possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being fitted.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road truck carrier.
The conversion could therefore draw on liability disputes.
Since both the logging and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, Haas argued that the conversion of the crossing should not be accepted.
At this point too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition was significantly lower than that of the other crossings, because it is directly adjacent to the centre of the stop to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down to the point where no collision threatens.
The majority of the amendments to this railway crossing were refused approval, as the city of Schiltach had to "send out" the problem with seated vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The panel considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been reached.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
At least on some of them there are lives, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for gravitational waves?
Or do you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or, after earthlike planets, find and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are specifically addressed by the European Space Agency Esa.
For their programme "Cosmic Vision", they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to advance research decisively.
The budget for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
There were 30 ideas in the debate, five of which have now come to a close.
Numerous bodies are reviewing the proposals, checking the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme launched in 2007 will find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large clouds of gas - and hence the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the Space Telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined more closely in our near environment.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could depict earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also supposed to reveal what conditions exist for the emergence of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the resulting particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there is the budget of about half a billion euros) on this issue.
The probe will start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa foresees the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also some deviations that might lead the physicists to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come into existence and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter of stars, planets and living beings like us, there are dark matter whose gravity holds up galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", Esa has already approved an M mission which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate for the first time the distribution of matter in the universe in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
In the opinion of many experts "E-Lisa", the best chances of being granted an L-Mission are a demanding concept for proofing waves of gravity.
This includes physicist changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on earth, he could also prove waves of gravity created by the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four more proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which aims to detect and investigate earthlike planets.
There are already some suggestions for the transfer of samples from Mars, for the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany regarding US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and announce before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat my opinion as a fidelity and tries to criminalise political opinion with impunity, in which no defense is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charges by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
The relationship between the USA and Germany is strained by the allegations that NSA had stopped the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, Member of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for secret services, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness, if this was possible, 'without endangering him and ruining relations with the USA altogether'.
Strobele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA staff member Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs assurance that he is 'safe' there, says the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw himself exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had expelled him from his home country.
However, he was touched by the global reaction to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden made an offer of cooperation to the German authorities when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation were solved.
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if it was in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier stated that when the fee was paid in advance, they would charge $25 and $100 for travellers who paid only on the flight path.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is aimed at moving travellers, taking care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she said.
Airlines started in 2008 to charge fees for the first and second cancelled luggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overfilled.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said at the new fee it wasn't really about making money.
It was about the most loyal customers from Frontier who had clearly expressed that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the field above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take a piece of luggage free of charge at the front flight path, but the next person must pay 100 dollars for a comparable luggage item.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedure would be changed so that passengers were informed about the fee before they arrived at the airport.
The new Frontier hand luggage fee will only come into force in summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often hesitate about luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to take advantage of them.
They argue that transporting luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street regard the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far left the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed first hand baggage fees three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitored the additional fees.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit will bring $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with spirit and was curious about what would be expected on the flight path if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The boarding process was among the most efficient I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth kneading and hand-held discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like lubricated."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and that coffee should be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for refreshing drinks, but it did so again seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had gone down.
Frontiers Step to raise charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers for direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontiers have, however, gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to give only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel office.
On Wednesday the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
Therefore, a third-party flight booked with Frontier over 1000 miles will bring only 250 miles to customers.
Passengers can also book places exclusively when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report published by the parent group Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs From the Bible
A good 40 women visited the last woman’s breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church congregation of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the town hall were "Sprichwörter aus der Bibel" and "Sprichwörter aus der Mittelalter".
Zita Köhler, chairman of the church council, attended the Bible proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
"Words contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: Wooden eyes are watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone who gives to His Lord in sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also advised their listeners what the proverb was.
Speaking from the Middle Ages, the church council was adopted by Christel Dehner: All good things are three, make blue, throw something away.
She explained the importance and origin of the sayings that she called "break into the past".
A tombola was finally released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously defined before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, the mayor also mixed the candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry is under way at the Mecklenburg Lakes Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"Anew is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
The benefits were varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gastättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA states that an “internal error” and not hacker is the fault of the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency stated on late Friday that an error had crippled its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as it was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a scheduled update," explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesperson had declared to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "in no way compromised".
Secret information is not in danger, according to the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have lamed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactic is relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (no such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and looks at the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program in Germany and abroad, with sharp criticism – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by former NSA staff member Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over intelligence has fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyberoperation.
The number of people without a job has slightly decreased by 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the rate is 3.1 per cent better than last year and better than in September, "we would have hoped more," says Monika Feld-Bauer, Deputy Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many farms have so far responded to recruitments.
According to Feld-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the crafts sector, in the health sector and in the care of the elderly".
Since September, there have also been job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
The winter season starts in mid-December.

Losses of profits in Bombardier after reduction in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday, after being put under pressure by decreasing orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier based in Montreal also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
Up to now, only three additional take-offs were followed on the flight of the test aircraft’s maidens, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of outperform to sector performance in order to have a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although lower delivery rates for aircraft were expected to be the best, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
If, however, no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But until now, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
Business management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft's lifetime ground tests and software updates had been engaged.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, whatever we have done.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, was called by the company.
Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical about whether the first customer can operate a Cseries aircraft twelve months after the flight.
Bombardier said it was reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and would update it in the next few months.
"The slow advance of the flight test – even if it is obviously consistent with Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that the start-up of the first quarter of 2015 is moving," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's profit profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the aerospace sector amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on September 30th and was therefore unchanged on December 31st.
"In the field of aviation and space, the results were disappointing within our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector increased by just under 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order stock in the transport division was $32.6 billion on September 30 and was slightly increased on December 31st.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new guidelines for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share was 8.5 percent down and was 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was announced that the Google Finance Director Patrick Pichette will change to the Board of Directors.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's narrowest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at the LAX airport on Friday afternoon (local time).
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man has also been killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed of the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated to have seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and children cried.
Among the waiting people panic broke out, many would have hidden behind chairs for fear.
He's heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security department suffered a gunshot at the foot.
The scene had been "like in a movie".
After that he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a security surveillance area.
Airport building evacuated
There were TV footage showing the traffic of numerous ambulances and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were safed out of the building.
Users published photos on Twitter of a special command line and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management reported on Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, thus, according to CNN, long backstacks were formed.
Until landings, air transport had been temporarily stopped, it was said.
However, several planes on CNN were also observed at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles Airport is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine addict who warned drug boss against police investigation has to go to prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a large police investigation because he was afraid of being exposed to his secret drug addiction was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on his activities in drug trafficking after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The first-class lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the lawyer's chamber.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were supervised by the police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured a series of house searches worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he was afraid that his drug addiction might become public.
Today Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court in two charges for obstructing justice following a three-week trial.
He admitted to cocaine possession on a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the trash can of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A in his hair, wallet and credit cards had been discovered.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, claiming that his discussion was subject to the "secret of attorney".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
In his police interrogation, he said that he would run an office under his private address as well as at the workplace, and his clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known to the court that he had called and informed important actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, of what the investigators knew about them.
State Attorney Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has taken too much time with certain clients.
The questionable relationship is not simply that of a drug dealer, but rather that of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into error.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Detta pointed out every misbehavior and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender at the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromising and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his career.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial impediments, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared guilty of the conspiracy to the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug abuse.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Song Crane Dunningen will embrace two divine services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which attracted the spectators in the spring of this year, the Song Crane will enrich two divine services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 at the evening Mass in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and from Sunday, October 27, at the church service in St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf starting at 10.15.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its origin.
The Mass is presented as part of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronnn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism deviates from obvious confidence
The elections to the parish in 2015 will change fundamentally, for example, in the Haslach (SE) mental care unit.
There is then only one common parish for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing more to change in the fundamental decisions of the Diocese and it is up to the parishes to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear that the scepticism towards the new one is hesitant, but it is obvious that there is confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the county council were enough.
The regional dean Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Freiburg Archdiocese.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a public law body which enters into the rights and obligations of the six churches so far.
There will only be a joint parishioner and a foundation council in which the parish priest Kraft Office is represented.
At least two elected members from each parish are to be represented, six parishes forming so-called community teams on site.
Their task will in future be to promote church life in the area.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets will remain assigned to the parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the overall community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all parishes, there was great concern.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone have been invested", Haslach's parish chairman, Bruno Prinzbach, relativized.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had done their job in 2006, "one thing, five stay" and had to find that this was not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelorgein unit then addressed the question of the future composition and size of the joint parish and the practical work of the community teams.
The drafts will be put into practice at further meetings and agreed at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, opposite the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family will receive 70 to 90 Euros per year.
The rise in the so-called EEG conversion from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour is essential.
This conversion is re-established by the four operators of the large electricity lines in October each year.
These figures are the additional costs resulting from the energy transition, which they can raise by a conversion over the electricity price.
The town works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher environment, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the municipal works could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We're starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, whereas the number will be closer to the 2 cents.
Ampel på Endurance Red: Keep on Waiting
Sometimes a light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
Then what do you do - drive by red?
If a person concerned has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart's lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting period, however, had to be "appropriate" which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to last at least five minutes before the traffic light has to be affected by a malfunction.
Those who continue the journey despite red light must be aware, however, that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of permanent redness and had to be responsible for a negligent red light breach.
The light was not defective, but turned to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but the fine did not.
City council is happy about sound household
Whenever it comes to the household in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known to the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success in this sense.
This became evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
As a result, the surplus was mainly higher commercial tax receipts and the municipal share in income tax.
Also, the asset budget was clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the 1.5 million euros planned, he was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investments than planned have been made in the financial year 2012, the provision of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the overall deficit could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of your sleeve," Gerster praised in view of the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but precisely these good figures could soon be more expensive for the citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has in the past been able to dispense with high lifting rates.
In turn, however, Gerster said that subsidies had often been cut off from the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various levels of compensation.
Among other things, the cities and communities applying for grants must provide certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of raising rates, since in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years of singing, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colours of his male singing club on stage.
Even after 60 years, the singing with the now probably more than loved choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
Jörg Kohr, pastoral officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, received several awards for his engagement and association, as the choir is also a church choir, he presented a certificate of association and an honor letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tin counter.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was held in popular courses: With the MGV Betra, the Song Crane Salzstetten, the singer's department Baisingen and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which included around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, her brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared for the honor of a small statue - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Beta also sang classical choral songs such as "huntering" by Julius Wengert, "White, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulscher" - the song star Salzstetten provided for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir was abducted with the Neapolitan popular style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulscher" also applied to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned with "What Isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" to the local section, where the Fullmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small programme - "Oma Hanne" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl theatre and read a few stories that the children spent the afternoon working well.
Children’s Dreams Become True
The kindergartens and daycare facilities in the Zollernalbkreis receive post these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wishes to support the facilities in the realization of their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandpit?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and daycare children can participate in the action from the entire Zollernalb circle.
If you have a construction or embellishment request for your facility, you can apply with this in the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of action kindergarten building site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest bots, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be to realize with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 euros and on an (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide many diligent building helpers.
What about the Day of Action and the Helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
'We are in a frightful situation and we should ask ourselves, 'What does Parliament intend to do about abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?' was to read in the paper which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is dramatic and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
'I hope the President will listen to us and we will appeal to him to reject this draft law and to send it back to Parliament,' he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government took the new law "the media effectively into a spell". On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered "a heavy blow" and titled the draft as "draconian".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of armed Islamists' attacks at the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published photographs of security cameras on which to see how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a press invocation.
Under the new law, media houses can be confiscated with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan Schillingen and individual journalists with up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, 'although a single punishment can push most radio transmitters into bankruptcy'.
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's living blogosphere description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation that calls Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back into the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, Kenyan legislators have been causing public trouble.
In May, they agreed to withdraw the reductions ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reintroduce their deft salaries of about 532,000 schillings free of tax per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for FC
In spite of the cold weather and rain, the official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports field did not pay any attention to the importance for the city and the football club.
A more pleasant celebration had all wished for last Saturday, but Peter did not want to join in.
Thus all those who came without an umbrella or could not keep one for any reason.
This happened to the musicians who embraced the ceremony, as did many speakers.
So wet was also the FC President Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klummpp, who had been very committed to the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, to the companies involved and association members who contributed.
Here in particular Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The restless pensioners placed 400 square meters of pavements for the new paths.
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also honoured by the Landtag member Karl Rombach.
Other greetings were given by the Urban Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn have added to the original lawn so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there was the first thought of solving the problem when it was thought to build a third place on the site of the football club or at the real school on the Salinsee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the construction of an artificial lawn sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, pledged a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country’s funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000.
The construction of the 68 times 108 meters artificial lawn square took place on June 4.
During the construction phase lasting more than three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike line.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
The responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning for this purpose.
Among other things, we are dealing with direct democracy, parliamentarians and federal police.
In the morning, the Working Party on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue their deliberations.
This should include the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting views.
The SPD wants to end the coercion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double pass.
With regard to transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD reinforced its no toll to a car toll requested by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "flat rate for the multiple and thus ecologically counterproductive", said the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There is a threat of abstinence on rural roads, which are already the main causes of accidents.
Furthermore, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for German will be removed at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be the right summer?" was not really the question on Friday evening at the Freilichtbühne Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.

Heavy injury to motorists in the event of an accident
In the event of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was severely injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on his way to Grefrath with her car at 21.15.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Strasse, she oversaw the 37-year-old’s arriving car.
The cabs collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Locking after accident at the schänzlekreisel
The accident had come out of the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 20 o'clock, on the left track of the two-track Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left turn track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This led to a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old constanzer.
Also damaged was the driving VW Passat of a 19-year-old.
A total of about 15000 damage to property was reported by the police.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, called it.
Vienna airport arranges passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In future, there will be no more talk of how this will be done at the Vienna-Schwechat airport.
Much of the loudspeaker's transmission is thus lost - the noise level should be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport Spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the attitude of media that affect individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
By the disappearance of these messages - on average, on one day some 200 personal calls by the speakers - will be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual passages have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight or departure times is going a bit under way here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games at the Kaltenhof
There is also a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September in addition to the train with tractors.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander-Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are dressed in Swabish on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and single fighters measure themselves in the disciplines torches, hoof irons and water buckets.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't go far," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown out vertically, should get over it once and then just come to the deck.
This is assessed by most points.
The point of accuracy is the point of jumping.
From eight meters away is thrown onto a plock.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and quantity of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
Two of each "Clan" or team may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and one-off competition will receive prizes.
You can be trained from 10 a.m.
It is desirable to wear appropriate clothing, for example, that the contestants take off in a lap skirt.
But Swabian costume is also allowed.
For "Outfit", the jury will give a few bonus points.
You can log in up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish and Swabian Highlander game and tractor pull, which starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the bubble music friends come to their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Birabömische Blasmusik from Schömberg creates the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast Polkas and fairy tales.
Their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a rich big band sound.
With it, Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and the Schwarzwurstbaron, will be among the herds for a while.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzuft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein holds linen stetten to the morning shovel, starting at 14.00 p.m., the peasant chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival end.
The stop paint party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
Other program points include the Oldtimer and Schleppersträgen, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry on Saturday and Sunday.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislavyrinth, the craftsman market and the sheep shear.
Especially for children there is a strike zoo, straw hopburg, tractor ride (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein Multipurpose Hall, the Ski Club and the Tractor Friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant tooth, for example, is a square set.
The Vegetarian Federation is also called World Vegan Day on 1 November.
The German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt let replace by soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Smurfable plant teeth replace conventional whiskers.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half-pressed, mature bananas can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linen seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Instead of egging doughs will become softer, for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people currently feed on vegan in Germany, i.e. just plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to her host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest high school met the American metropolis New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous Skyline, which in the evening lights makes a special appeal.
Due to the shift of time, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided the day on Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
It was then the financial center around Wall Street to mark September 11th.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire-State Building.
After that, it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their host families and experienced school life at the Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the story of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blower group of the Westphalians under the direction of Brigitte Kluth music on Parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) according to old, original French melodies.
The bladders wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunts musically.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed look shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the event of a visit to the same named café at the turnout in the district town of Kleve in terms of visibility to the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to remain during the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, with the beautiful name, the café has exactly the goal: to make an actual stay not only thoughtful, but always experience again and again.
Because it's fun and just nice.
A look at the inner life at the turn-off 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café-ambient looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves before the opening of the tasty café at the notice as a gastronomist: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve at the turnoff, the sympathetic café lovers are hoping for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," emphasises Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all ages between them.
Speaking of Cafe-Liebhaber.
The sympathetic husband and wife are behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoys the fragrant hot brew in various variations themselves.
Expressophane
Daniel Büttner is more of the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"That's what a baguette - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbor festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatzend.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not an excellent fan of event evenings: "You can't do it right now".
And with an event I'm always just addressing those who are also interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
This is supposed to be: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the turnout in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many clubs, guests from close to and from far away and the students who discover the gashstrom ropes and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Stiftungsfest at which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly arrived.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed harmonious cooperation completely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate firmness to perform honors.
About the special award "Singer of the Year" this time the writer Rolf Wagener was pleased.
"Not only did you write a lot for us, but you also made a lot of rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activities were given to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "songwriter of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you was addressed by the board to the team of association hostess Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had conjured up a menu of the extra-class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets his regular choral samples at 19.45 p.m. at the club's premises.
"New vocal voices are always welcome to us," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new targets for combating poverty
The United Nations is starting to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the advance of "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced at the summit in the evening that the time had come to 'think beyond national interests'.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch a process to achieve universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given me by the Member States in order to realise our vision of sustainable development goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball supervisors still have a good mood.
There's no doubt about it, Coach Tomasz Malmon.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't know how a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck has currently not broken out of trees, Malmon raises the index finger in advance.
Many players I have trained in the A-Jugend myself.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is necessary to wait for backup to be made from the first," explains the SG Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the past performances.
Above all, in the cover work and in the switchover game, it seemed huge.
There must also be a definite improvement in the utilization of opportunities.
That's why I hope my players finally get their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the independence square of the capital.
Since two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by White-ruled Rhodes and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy, much is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal stocks in the north-west could bring in investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the coming years.
The governing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional high-rise province of Renamos on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a 'loser' who 'will use all his remaining powers to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.'
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gave up the peace agreement of 1992.
In contrast to the FT, he stated that he meant that Frelimo did not respect the agreement anymore.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of tensions fired by a series of clashes this year.
"We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide with the heads," said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are well traded and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a offending movement to generate concessions and financial advantages from the government.
Renamo's election has shrunk since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democratico de Moçambique (MDM), is expected to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation occurs when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has been carrying out unrestrained attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railroad for one month after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga reluctantly answered the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people already cared about corruption, slowing progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and easy-to-use roads," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models of life", says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks", and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were "too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools", which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" of old-fashioned works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in authors and teachers who are "overly didactic", children would be "abstained" completely, because in entertaining stories the messages would be "substantiated".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales, said: "One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an imperative sense of good and evil.
This must be understated, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling stories.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob acquired his age-resting seat in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short play of the scene.
From his arrival to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece, which received much approval under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained the contexts and bridged the leaps of time from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home in his childhood sky, in his free yard.
And then the scene began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht he performed with the two-legged and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get into the role of the sister and gave her immense life in Mimics and Gestik.
Between the individual performances the Mühlenbach peasant chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance.
Haslach's mayor, Heinz Winkler, was honoured to be awarded the honor of Hattich, who, in representation of Hattich's then official, together with a part of the City Council.
Their anticipation then made the three-kinge singer, which led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Also as beautiful, there are again childhood memories of my own Three-Kingdom."
With their song "O Jesselin" they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the storchenday children with their loud "Out, Out".
At that time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the Church as well as his concerns about the expansion of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home country, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his rest.
"A restful spirit had finally found its tranquillity and had gone home forever," said it at the end of the scene.
Many applause and many praiseworthy words were given by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of the league remain of the sports-decreased Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer have increased.
Because if there's a game card procedure, there's less for Neckar Riesen.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project refrains from applying for a possible rebound.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard process so long that Düsseldorf won't get a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, starters Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the Arbitration Court and demonstrate its economic viability in the Bundesliga.
So far, however, the license has been refused twice to the Rhine countries.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Evening Meal comes to the fore
As a contribution of the city to the 150-year-old Consisting of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its public guided tours on Sunday, October 27th, the evening meal church.
After the visit to the nuclear museum, the Haigerloch period after 1850 is to be considered when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The culmination is a visit to the Church of the Evening Meal.
There, the leaders get the story of the church's construction told and gained insight into the development of the Evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also looks at the evening meal painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the second half-hour tour is at 15 o'clock at the nuclear museum.
There are maps at the cashier of the nuclear cellar museum.
The tourist office of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. affairs.
Representatives of the State Prosecutor General could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia.
This was notified by the Interfax Agency, calling for unannounced circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, it was said.
A trip out of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," said the Agency's source.
Because Germany was ally of the USA, Snowden threatened the delivery there, it continued
Long Breath Pays
Six men's teams fought for the winning title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.

Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the Halde.
The company has several irons in fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is relying on wind turbines logistics among other things.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue pallets and rechargers distribute or charge the coal here as needed.
Every movement of the wrappers sounds like a loud bellow over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rheinus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this is to be heard far away with unfavorable wind - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city orders.
He took the actions very seriously and therefore contacted the parties concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it would now be possible to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In future, he also put on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has some things to do.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-decreased sunbathing tub of a terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can also be finished here.
"This year, we want to break the 3-million-ton mark during the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground, the import coal goes to domestic power stations.
If the GDF-Suez power plant still goes to the grid, well over 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship chargers on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria's basketball player despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to diminish the enormous optimism among the basketball players of the FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the last two years," said Bavaria-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the top defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At its first third appearance in the European king class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages.
The guests first managed to transform the art, a 15-point recovery stand 13 minutes before the end of the game, before Piraeus gave another turn to the game.
"We fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again we made a fool of ourselves," said Yassin Idbihi, Bayern-Profi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munichers, who had celebrated clear victory in the first two games against the Italian racing champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish champion Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: 10 years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a competitor at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Caroline stand-up institute, this year the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known at some point to appear in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefice event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians that participate in this year's festival have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the crew both at Saturday Night Live and at Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both krroll and slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN arms companies and Germany.
"After years one now had an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides would come up with a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game camwheels with machete
Two children in Uruguay have committed the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go with them on bird hunt.
Armed with Macheten and knives, they caught up with the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País".
Then they would have played in front of their apartments in a workers' neighborhood football.
The body was found in the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the disciple they had taken with them should have said that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the tattoo before the police without mentioning an attack against them, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other reasons, the elder called a rivalry in football games.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institution.
Prisoner must:
Due to exploitative human trafficking, detention, threat, insult and dangerous body injury, the County Court of Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years imprisonment.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, confessed in the context of a trial agreement.
Thus, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against her will.
He used to break up with violence and threats.
For some years, he kept the revenue of the women who bought it for him.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he made contact with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who provided the women, he brought them to various brothels in the South West.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenue.
The defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed serious doubts about the psychological limitation and therefore of a limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking were identified after a first display by telephone surveillance.
The overheard conversations had been marked by high aggression.
In later hearings the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, one of the women who had discovered blue spots all over the body, has not yet made any statement.
It is about "a completely broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has separated himself from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after imprisonment," he said.
Oil price continues after 96 USD per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report, according to which the energy-hunting manufacturing sector in China is growing.
The December reference raw oil varieties for deliveries had fallen by 14 cents in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The great supply of crude oil has been a burden on prices over the past few weeks.
The US Ministry of Energy said on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in Chinese production activity.
This suggests a continued recovery of China's economy, with growth rising to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London around 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the stop-and-frisk directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("catches and searches") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by the way the program for the arrest and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the planned remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme.
The appeal court heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be relieved of the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyism; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they misguided black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service supervision, and appointed a pilot programme with cameras carried out on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
This kind of control has been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all the minorities filed a lawsuit, which developed into a collective complaint.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD stop-and-frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force and influence the way other police presidencies use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morals of the police, but not the crime; also money wasted and the wider problem of a police who were under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the controls were implemented by the NYPD.
Of the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman, Henna, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the stakes were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
This is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, is planning to work in advisory function at the association.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the medical station in Socogim, a miserable neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just about a week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized away in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not travel as many as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to stay here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medications, bandages, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Füttel himself supplied abundant local coloration by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles remodeled to the mobile goat house and the experiences of the tribal musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he named his work in the field of auditing as a young MEP.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Füttel also stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it was not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking for checking a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a false tip about an affair by Charles Clarke, Minister of the Interior.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the court in Old Bailey, News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper instructed the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court heard.
"In the opinion of the prosecutors, Coulson, who is now the editor of the emergency, is no one who stands in front of people's homes hoping to catch them in a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story in order to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said, NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the supervision, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He dispels this, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors of an affair of Clarkes were first picked up by the feature editor of Notw, when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the time that the research ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow about which I would like to speak with Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former interior minister David Blunkett.
The defendants heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted with a married woman because of an affair when he himself was led to the co-supplied Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have sworn with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reich tax, the French football has actually been going through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will be concluded without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France managed to find a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
Although President François Hollande received on Thursday in the Parisian Élysée-Palast Association and Association representatives, he also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to relinquish the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all of the country's companies would pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November is now also going through, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The days of play in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are therefore excluded.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," said Mayor Jens Hößler, opening the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the measures planned, ask questions, raise concerns and bring ideas.
Hößler made it clear: "The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council".
The flood, which struck Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an incisive event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, says Hößler.
A river basin survey was commissioned by the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The goal is to protect as many built land as possible," says Hößler.
The planning of the protection is based on a statistically every 100 years, according to Deutsche Wetterdienst.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent surcharge.
In technical circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gehingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Hößler.
In order to achieve the HQ 100aKlima protection, Gechingen will need to invest around four million euros, while the municipality can expect around 70 percent with national grants.
Mr Haustler pointed out, however, that only if an overall approach was implemented would there be support.
The community was dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and authorisation procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) foresees local measures in the influx of Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to address their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, technical planner of the responsible engineering office Wald and Corbe from Höllsheim, who introduced the concept, stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe said that one was obliged to find the most economical solution.
In the case of people in the old town who, even in the case of normal thunderstorms, have always suffered from overburdening of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, he pointed out that the guidelines for sewerage systems were different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be seized.
Larger dimensioning of wastewater canals would swallow millions.
Severely Injured After Collision
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were severely injured on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could say little at first about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old ruler of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided together, with the woman being so badly clamped that the fire brigade took about half an hour to free her from the wreckage.
The real cause of the accident was unexplained at first.
Both victims came in nearby hospitals.
The track remained closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a god seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Surprisingly the kinship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski, with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, is to be read by Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with Paranoia, Security Guard and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
It's a fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Mindaments Report" dates back to 1956, and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tributal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", which is what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles our terrifying, mutants look to the future - and the police approach.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the Authority.
"We get them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "In our society there are no criminals, we have a criminal camp full of Pesudo criminals." You read time streams.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from actually being implemented.
Dick's story works like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the NSA's hearing noise.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor itself is monitored and a future crime is transmitted.
The system's going through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It creates its own conditions.
Not only buys mistakes and victims, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Spa deal about Merkel in Russia pronounces
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. affairs of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutors could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Bundestag, had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures reinforce company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital of finance.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of Constitution and Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the USA and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again stated in September that the United States did not use foreign espionage opportunities "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profit."
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become a Whistleblower, has begun publishing his fillet horn to American surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that they can speak to the Director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow led to the disclosure that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was established, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can come to the fore, then certainly corporate management are also potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US was now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, a survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents leaked through Snowden that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical refinement of the U.S. spying authorities discovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest spying risk in China.
Cloud computing is a major change because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the US are subject to the case law and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after disclosures about US-American data mining activities with prism, about ten percent of non-US-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that there hasn't been yet a year ago – she says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these are physically in this legal space?"
Many German corporate leaders are of the opinion that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate governance usually does not brag about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have been inspired for a long time that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or unattended laying of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, I would like to say.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at Automanufacturer Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access," warns BVT in a report.
The USA warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, US National Intelligence Estimates in February France, Russia and Israel were placed behind China in rank two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French interior intelligence DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives an answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony was successful now gave a special fair at the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept going again.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front are the often rustled and closed with embroidery clothes, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
Since, however, the ghosts differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house dressmiller.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastic, but it can also be selected cream-coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the local, has been explained.
Jewelryless adjacent rooms are not ideal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the belt.
If you want to ride the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
"Kuts are also popular for boys' birthdays," he says.
Romance is also needed for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion come the "after-wedding photo" - so photo series in special places, preferably for instance waterfalls, some days after the party, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Dog Friends Successful
For the time being, the athletes of the dog-friends Bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class of Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it with 87 points to place twelve.
With her Woody in Class 1, Susi Höpp took critical look at the performer.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teen's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in Georgia, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat that was behind the gallery in the school hall.
The detectives of Lowndes County's sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died the way the sheriff concluded it.
"They believe that there is no logic that violates both the laws of physics and the common sense of the human being," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be hidden in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation of Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unsolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
That's what Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died as a result of a "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, has given rise to another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would order the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's administration was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teen’s parents said they hoped that the video records contained clues as to how he died.
To publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for handling food allergies from children to schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government, as the number of school-based children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools designed to raise awareness of food allergies in the teacher and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – in order to be able to encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more readily in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something's pressing on my tongue," "my tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "my tongue wringles".
Parents of intersexual children can choose "Wickedness Undecided"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with undisclosed genitalia.
Neonates are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions in relation to surgery for a sex assignment in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to BBC, an intersexual person said years later: "I am neither man nor woman."
I'm gonna stay with the girl that's been created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children does not come to the world as a boy or a girl every year.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of ‘sexual differentiation disorder’ (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, glands (eggsticks or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend using the best available information on gender assignment if a determination is not possible and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds after a good thing".
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child at all develops his gender identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret that people are homosexuals.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, it states that intersexual people are distinct from transsexual or transgender individuals, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, stamina, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that is faced by intersexual and transgender people in working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not matching with the gender picture boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to mention male, female or third sex on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "unsex" person after a court had granted lifelong maintenance of a "undetermined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German certificates will have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, such a message to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the 'poor theory' from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online website has also spoken against the German law, stating: "If the world is torn into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would be better off if babies were given a gender at birth.
"Parenthood is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and safety.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were termed Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine viewed the sex as something that one could erase and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are called into question, since now it is known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they have assigned.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a "psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, you called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory of treating children with indistinct genitalia dates back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was moldable.
He shaped the term "sexual identity" and argued, social and environmental offenses – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person was considered male or female.
However, in a case known as John/Joan from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised a boy's parents, whose penis had been cut off in the event of a mischievous circumcision, to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but what it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have entered the public, which are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-man chromosomes, but had two distinct genitals.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to the male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based Legal Group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law could "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign ‘not defined’ to the child,” she said.
We fear that this will favour intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognized as third-generation".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorises" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgenic resistance.
Due to the recipe order defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee of the child psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child by adoption or by a hymn.
"The law gives parents space, so that they do not have to make decisions that are outrageous," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things and thus gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy your parental happiness.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be undone anymore.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they believe they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the sex that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decision.
Unknown injured girl by shooting from car
Unknowns have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt on shots from a car.
The perpetrators probably fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left Wade.
Rescuers brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found out it was called Friday.
Until now, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and immediately removed the Eierste, no material damage should have arisen either.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were also lit in the city area, but also here no damage was caused.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel slides were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man invented his wheel slides in the immediate vicinity of everyone, which is why the police did not have to continue working.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and also not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern about not being able to handle the many stairs to the house and the apartment at an age, she explains.
In addition: Since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifthiger has had to learn on his own body what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently, a book of hers has appeared on the subject of 'Happy living in old age - Which type of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going to happen at all', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people who are even dealing with the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most people get out of here as long as they can.
Always always just the others', she says muttering.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
'Then it can be too late, too,' Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living at an age.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D e solution does not give it for age.
Even those who can afford the old age residence in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, one also unites in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives thought to aliens.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative living forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At age, everyone has his ticks and Macken
'For me such a community would be nothing,' she said with a twinkle of eyes.
Not at all as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'When you're old, you just need your retreat rooms, too,' Ries said.
Nevertheless, the book author does not want to exclude the fact that an elderly community can work.
But this had to go differently than in the classical student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, too,' she believes.
With this view, she is not alone in the capital of the state.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civic service living at the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people on the topic of 'becoming a parent'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also buy inconveniences and limitations, only to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
There are many ways today to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the old-fashioned conversion of their home or home should first inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the first-best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the apartment, one or another let it be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer will clear up.
But it is not always possible to reorganize the existing apartment with age and accessibility, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, which would also pave the way up to the apartment door with stairs, this would be a much bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving out, she was digging more than before the spider at her apartment door.
US intends to pursue Snowden further criminally
The U.S. has not changed its attitude to former U.S. intelligence staff Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of misrepresenting classified information.
That's why he had to file criminal proceedings in the US, said the U.S. Secretary of State Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent Snowden comments would not change that either.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA not to further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that it was in the case of Ströbel's remarks about a parliamentarian rather than a German member of the government.
Secret Service Gate Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a discussion with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA staff member, who was sought by the United States, in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the federal attorney general.
Following a translation by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
Subjects
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was formerly contractually or through a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my work in these institutions, I became a witness of systematic violations of my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent hatred that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the disclosures to be a system of comprehensive surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations made many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the former misuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken up were significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat Dernes as a fidelity and strives to criminalise political opinion and to prosecute.
Yet: Proclaiming the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this debilitating stance.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to take part in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, adequately and legally.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to preserve international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The local council approved the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "appropriate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied", Maier emphasizes.
In the budget, 100 000 euros were employed.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the previous kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, like to heat, look into the garden and clear the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Space concert at summery temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman, Manuela Honeck, explains the pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first music shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing bids by Hillary Clinton
The closest consultant to President Barack Obama has secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the book soon to be published, and on Thursday evening she reported that the president's top advisors had carried out “extreme group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama's falling hope of re-election would be better if he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House employees, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, which effect it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the vice president.
The change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, the former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and the former leading advisor of the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluffe – knew about the change.
'Double Down' claims that Daley was at the forefront of the efforts to exchange bids despite her 'neighbourly personal relationship' before deciding against such a move after the data showed that the candidate Clinton's 'could not significantly improve Obama's chances'.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing bids with Clinton.
"I said a number of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," said Daley, the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "For God's will, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "careworthy", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election a considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of the polls.
"In campaigns, if you don't think seriously about something, you don't spend so much money on polls and focus groups," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the President was "conscious" of the possible change, the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that 'Double Down' did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama knew nothing about the investigations about whether to drop bids in the elections.
"Possible", Martin replied.
What happens to my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail technically implemented in the same way as in the conventional mail?
In the design of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been used to create a stable foundation for sound correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the two computers directly connected?
Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to the e-mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, Google would.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content of his provider.
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read on the way several times by software robots.
With the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail leads to a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provider checks whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability that unauthorized persons read an email is extremely small.
But theoretically, that's possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal expatriation measures.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from co-reading?
With an encryption in accordance with the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively by co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to mask the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a survey by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen, GMail was able to significantly increase by Google.
Mother scattered in the forest and collected pension
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and still collected their pension and care allowance.
In order to pay further pension and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after investigations by the police.
First of all, he hid the death of the 89-year-olds, and then spent more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, it occurred that no medication was needed for the needy mother.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this occurred strangely to officials, they continued to determine.
It was found that for more than 15 years, the two had lived in a common home and he had maintained it last.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
Want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice that shines in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a luminous leak.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on quails and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the brilliant protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, thus raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth of the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween, because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jelly light is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious for it.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and for itself impossible due to the light rupture caused by the ice crystals, which consists of ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a crop that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
After six days of playing, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league.
Calculated now it will be tomorrow for the team of Ingo Ehlers to go to the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we'll finally have our head free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
At last, with the exception of Hendrik Blohme, he has at his disposal his complete cadre.
Daverden is also setting us up as we are.
We therefore need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase in the coverage, which has last left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because everything can always happen in Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to post in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this purpose, the A-Jugend Joost Windsßust, who is active with double-play law at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffler.
Over the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute my home from sweets and will probably not do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep for Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, says the U.S. Federation of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween, then, are the trend values.
Costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate items are the last scream.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that the Daft Punk Spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone with them to my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we're not squealing.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, lucerne, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who move through the neighborhood with the saying 'sweet or sour'.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let's not go – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the candy candy Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweet Products.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve.
Nothing is more of Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are, in fact, 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in the United States that earn 500 million dollars, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and put the friends on Facebook where you won't get rid of them again, and then one of the guy you're standing on leaves a comment like "near facial expression".
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the big pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting a pumpkin lizard is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we've made up of little.
Fortunately, last year the "baby in the pumpkin" trend began thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, says the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lizard, which slowly rots in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut a little pretty from their 921 kilo of pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains cold bodies
The fire brigade had to move out to Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the Hof district captures the night to Friday fire.
The rescue forces are storing a charred corpse from the house.
Rescue forces have found a charred body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as one of the police spokespersons in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The operatives went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
For the time being, the building was no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has started an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible shortage of parishes: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 according to their current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and the day itself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche has commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the Abitur.
Burfien has this to do with the process of deconsecration: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can put my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly more money will be paid in the free economy, but for this theologians would have a safe employer.
This is true of the young people today, who are concerned not only with careers but also with work that is filled with meaning.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, there are currently 60 pastors in retirement each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vikariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a wide range of training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior, there are racing seats and six point belts as well as a stand-alone system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with supervision of bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle loading between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as a accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different Rally disciplines in Great Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers for the rigors and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge-Wagen – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called for the rescue of a chicken, who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run off after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miscarriage
Firefighters sailed on rock face and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to secure a bitch that was stuck on a 15 - foot - high protrusion in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately been looking for their missing bitches and had published help calls on social networks as they escaped the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the location and sailed to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscles during her rescue – she was like stiff-frozen.
But now she's fine.
After that, she had eaten a few dog biscuits.
That was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was badly injured or worse.
Ruby was sent to the vet to investigate, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To see the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in their arms.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firemen have done great.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never touched Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker at night, and that "he went to see me when I was 18".
She added: "It has been a long time and he was very kind to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "conciously denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she has confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at this year's Rolling-Stones tour.
Her new album "Prism" landed on top of 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde presentation pointed out the potential economic benefits that would result in more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often comply with their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, continued non-respect for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in such years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the “independence means pass control” ducks at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should it be expected from an independent Scotland that it dances after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London Joch against that from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, after the war, has come to the fore.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe officially died.
All over the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party has been able to cast an alternative for Germany – only founded this year – almost five million votes in the Bundestag elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, appears to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the coercive jacket in which the respective national economy is required by maintaining the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has committed its members to exchange rates that are advantageous to German exporters – and that is what German politicians like to let.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, South Europe can be found with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European productivity problem behind current budget and monetary problems.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage-fixing regulations do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to the level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimisation, and Europe has repressed its own economic policy, which has to be fought by the attacked French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing leader, EU enemy front National has just won a decisive re-election and thus the reigning socialists point to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing division would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut off well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I would like to add: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) Nations' favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the USA.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Klein-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels – what they can put themselves in.
I believe that Scotland could go quite well in a looser European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar, thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping Norway equal and our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem Coalition had to take responsibility.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for independence now only in order to have a savings policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in young people
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family themes.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and sham hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Children's Association this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and presented a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents – this is usually not a sign that puberty is now rapidly entering puberty," explained Kaplowitz.
Obviously displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame hair, and shoulder hair, as well as body smell, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift at the age of the Menarche (seeking the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to reach the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, author of the book " Early Puberty for Girls: The Essential Counselor to Deal With This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is true that the breast enlargement is accompanied by an increase in breast size before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If more rapid progress is made, tests may be shown by an endicronologist to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstrual period and to ward off another episode: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days with ten.
Although there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She got scared and excited from school home because she was the first one in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories on the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys come in puberty similar to girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine years who created a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age comrades.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow the facial hair and shampooing earlier, the trend towards a full-scale previous puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The emergence of acne and sham hair is common even in babies and grandchildren.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician as they should speak to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than planned.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of tourist class seats in long-distance flights, which indicates that the tone is a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width that passengers are offered for long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are most concerned with, but this indicated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard that required a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are betting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance pilots and expect record orders at the event from November 17-21.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten – it is crucial for the declared economic results that the new mini-jumbo design will deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized '777X' fascinate 406 people with seats in the tourist class that are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains the competing version of the A350 transporters 350 people in 18-inch seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share high technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus now appeals to the public directly before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed donors a picture in which three people collide in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
In view of changing eating habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the US Department of Health data.
The waist size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival stuck to a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out which showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests the figures of Airbus on the seat dimensions and says that it is not in the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines design the balance between fares and equipment.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seating width.
"It is really important to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do in order to be successful," explains the cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know her business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic that can affect sales.
A race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least US$700 billion at list prices over the coming decades is behind the debate, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight for the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings' statements on the results partly depend on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in costs per unit is still lower than in the case of machines currently in use with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicate that many passengers opt for the tighter arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper fares.
"The eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat," says Mary Kirby, cabin facility expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world’s traveling jet sellers even carry a tape size to measure the establishment in the competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-end design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but has not sold yet according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered for some jets wide seats at the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard could probably refute, but could divert from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the Garau a pleasure when smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before tests on humans, further tests are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried out all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, whereby a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
On the other hand, mice would have taken an "outbreak" period, the researchers explained a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the Science Translation Medicine magazine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the level of the antibody that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, as it converts liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
“You know, if they start smoking again, they don’t feel any pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to stop the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi contested to have been influenced by Obed
Against the former minister of the Joe Tripodi laboratory party from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Supervisory Board.
The former NSW Minister contests the amendment of the regulations on maritime detention at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who held hidden holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) expanded its investigations on Friday to ask whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where Obeids operates two restaurants and a café without calling for tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined because of the allegation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the land after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had declared Ashpole accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed public tender for lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed and wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids with 2.5 million dollars a year, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public calls.
He disagreed, however, that he had made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced the government to redesign the lease arrangements.
One of the ICAC’s telephone captions showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had been transferred to the Harbour Ministry after working under the auspices of the Fisheries Authority.
'Where the topic discussed in these telephone conversations is the preparation of the commercial leasing arrangements?' asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
'No', Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighters attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighters had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior government officer to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to 'reality tests'
The government is thinking in the framework of extended measures on a 'truth test' for foreign workers with 457 visas.
Should the test be introduced, it would be applied through a criterion designed to prevent the 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for the move of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a draft discussion was published by the government after the former members of the laboratory party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be treated as insults by Australia's neighbours.
“Lutely strong statements such as ‘foreigners to get behind’ and ‘for Australia’ are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to embrace an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who spent yesterday talking about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considering.
If the 'reality criterion' is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be examined to see if 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company.'
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after hundreds of companies in the past, who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, have finally ceased to work.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumant probably died of a heart attack after arriving on the Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father died on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England as early as Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring Britain closer together'.
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We're going ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis on our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for the use of "unmistakable" for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection represents the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, create the benefits for everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, view or play videos during critical flight phases, provided they are in flight mode.
Passengers are already allowed this during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to implement the U.S. airlines’ redundancies in work, but do not pursue immediate plans to amend their rules.
The CASA Air Safety Authority also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical flight phases in Australia.
"The CASA does not currently have specific rules regarding the use of electronic equipment in aircraft" has been reported.
The subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already conducted talks with CASA about a use extension of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explains that you are open to change, but this should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic equipment by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we are now offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas stated that one will remain in the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic equipment may not be used at start-up and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects on American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with a poor view, the crew will show the passengers during the landing to turn off the equipment.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB supporters with light rockets had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced strong consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spastic acoustic, that offered the viewer in the signal Iduna Park until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart.
Most of the guests were heard with their songs.
The South Tributes, on the other hand, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented themselves extraordinarily silently: no songs, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo, who otherwise coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front on the Tribune, a large flag with the inscription "Sektion Stadium Forbidden".
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always entered the place as the first BVB player, sparked short-term jubilation.
When his teammates followed, there were loud vocals and wailing scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune nothing worked.
Even that stadium speakers Norbert Dickel added the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for ceremony.
Only five minutes before the reverberation the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension that had been held up until then with his hands unraveled in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Last of all, the South Tribute was on the row - and finally here was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbysieger stands up" came from the South Tribune, everything was again as always.
The silence before that was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately in front of Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB compliant trailers had light rockets fired into the audience and fired into the place - and almost hit the Torhüter Roman Weidenfelder.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and is believed to be Watzke's words, this was a rather tireless appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," announced the BVB boss at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke denied the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy in the field of pyrotechnology.
In addition, the ultras were shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of the next week.
"This will be cutting," assured Watzke.
One may be tense as the reactions to the South Tribune then turn out.
Peanuts boom in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pantry in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalena exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in there," says Amirtählena.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars every month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative assistant and also worked her husband, the monthly family income did not go well, she explains.
Indeed, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households increases – is so great that ValueMax, where she made her exchange, became this week's third Pantheon listed on the Singapurian Stock Exchange.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirtvengea – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortgages in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, houses offer the advantage that there is no need to review the creditworthiness or income evidence here, which is why loans are more readily available than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhäuser, after families feel pressured by rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a relaxed financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium incomes are looking for pafandhus to offset the difference in stuttering economies.
This week, the Ratings Agency identified Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly by increasing mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list at 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economic operators are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end-effect, this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segments (the income scale) will try to increase their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the last two years have furthered the trend towards pledges of personal items, as people are taking advantage of the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 pawn houses of the City State of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge Grandmother's gold chain and bring it back next month."
The largest Thai greenhouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pound business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only into the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the entry to the market in Singapore.
While some creditors had entered the crossfire because of high interest rates, yeah explains that pafandhuizen not only fined cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase the debt.
"Customers lend to items they already own and the liquefying of personal valuables does not increase household waste", she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted in society as a short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"This includes well-being who borrows something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA collects data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
As a matter of principle, the Secret Service Explorer Edward Snowden has an interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever-brilliant NSA pea business.
Following the presentation of Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Federation, during his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was a matter of which conditions the ex-secretarial staff would state at a German Public Prosecutor's Office or in front of an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government is based on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that Commonwealth will take 'out-of-date measures' to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government deliberations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has curtailed an emergency rescue package which, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325-million dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and treatment for grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day care clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for permanent stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic record of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas I have been told by the hospital staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanian Government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report on a monthly basis on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Mr Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if 'they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public health system to a more sustainable course.'
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a great contribution to taking the public health system of the state off the worry list," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely make up for recent cuts.
But the health spokesman of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a 'plaster solution'.
"We are therefore in a position today because the Labor government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth 300 million in and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton requested Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also more expensive than necessary.
The plot in France of the 1760s tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination to another.
The film never fades into laziness or sensationalism – and this is its problem.
The solemn Ernst, with whom the film is told, also makes him a tormenting handkerchief for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition production facilities, said the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while in the north there was serious clashes near one of the locations where potentially toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
On 1 November, the Damascus organization located in The Hague set up to destroy or "inoperate" all chemical weapons production facilities, including all poison gas mixing machines and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still needs to start by destroying existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when battles took place on Thursday in the city of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits here, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in Great Britain, announced.
The activists' group, which follows the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 being government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Sapphira against the rebels, many of whom have many connections to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The struggles underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, for their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against the time of a tumultuous civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team was “now convinced that it has seen and experienced all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.
Therefore, 'there are no further inspection activities planned at present'.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 sites listed by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, the visit of two institutions was not possible, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "repealed ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there had been transferred to other named facilities inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Sapphira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I draw attention to the bravery and courage shown by all of you in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the OPCW, in a comment published by OPCW.
For the past three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have fought against Assad's government and its security forces, many of which belong to the alavites, a division of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Angry of Judgment for Bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of 202 people who had died in 2002 during the bombing in Bali reacted indignantly to the judgment of the last of the instigators who were brought before the court, since Umar Patek was to be shot in their view of their stand.
Patek, who was on the run almost ten years ago as one of the most sought South-East Asians, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for his role in the construction of bombing bodies.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
In addition, a series of terrorist charges took place, including a wave of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Holy Evening in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have called for a death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb builder, is also called 'Demolition Man'.
The decision has aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a shootout command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day not having another grandson, and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground when a huge bomb exploded shortly after 23 o'clock on 12 October 2002 in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma for one month after the attack and died three times while he was on a life-saving system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy was supposed to get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to let him live.
20 years after he has killed 202 people and injured many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to be tried.
He almost escaped a decade of detention, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't sit down," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The judgment took place before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but don't have phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and watching movies from departure to landing, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they were implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and the arrangements for the stowage of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that they have already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"According to the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic equipment very soon," the FAA announced in a disclosure.
Passengers currently need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start them again until the plane reaches an altitude of three kilometres and gives the captain green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers must switch them off again and not be allowed to start them again until the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment also on the take-off, landing and rolling field, said the FAA.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional aviation association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like custodians on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometres were still prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a American Airlines jet in public because he refused to switch off the device while the plane was parked on the flywalk.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, as there is a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may impose a ban on certain electronic devices at the time of launch and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitters," says Rosenker.
Last month, a industry advisory committee launched by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri are of the opinion that there are no valid safety grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, there is talk of missing or ignoring up to one-third of passengers switching off the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of interference of navigation and communication equipment by passengers had become known as VHF radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not constitute electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment according to the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic equipment generally emits much less radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, only emit minimal radiation if you turn over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Among the defenders of a relaxation of the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company staff hired a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not detect.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the opinion that the interference with the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots talking about an interference of aircraft systems through the equipment, and most of them were very old.
However, the FAA recommended that pilots arrange for the switch-off of the equipment by the passengers in the event of instrument landing under poor viewing conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them reasonable adaptation for travellers who would today be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by air rescue service of North Sea-Bohrinsel rescued bird
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea island, was released into the wild again.
The water raids were flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where they were plucked up by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: "This water raid was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the bore island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
On their release, the water raids were fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with Great Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in Britain who are looking for prosperity and work want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 executives from the economy, representing the UK enterprise sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the states in the EU are stagnating.
They want new trade links to be favored by government, with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of holding to the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their view on certain legally regulated topics – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be withdrawn to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as according to the companies, the cost of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of the large companies approved what is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a price towards changing the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pressing for a 'meaning change' that brings the book of action back to the UK.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to 16 percent a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means that businesses have an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom refers to Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new Gastära
The start of the construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria was one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Executive Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream-Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom, Alexei Miller, Chairman of the Executive Board, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes across Europe.
A contract between Gazprom and his counterparts in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard officially.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were 'for all time' eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted prices when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual assaults related to children before 2011 against Child Care Officer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children reported.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had declared that "it was never in the organization to deal with an incident of sexual abuse of children".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which an YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography crimes, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for his abuse of trusted children.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening of the YMCA to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that 'it had given external audits of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety'.
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management had failed "from me downwards" at the position of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives.
Lord had been sentenced to 12 boys at the beginning of the year for sexual assault during his two years of activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that employees have avoided reporting Lord's crimes regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, she was privately cared for as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the head of child care, Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lord in the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable”.
The managing director said that he would not accept employee statements that they would not have trusted to refund their superior report.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare explained that he had informed the management board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan-Lord-Incident" concerned "not reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to force the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were made, had been made by the managing director of the children's services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but what had been 'over-evidence' and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, according to Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual abuse of children, the Commission.
He explained that there were "severe problems" in recruiting, reviewing, incorporating, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would take advantage of the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as a messenger of the Quartet of the Peace Founders in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the London Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse show experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to drive the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was taking place.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only a few months ago made his first steps, and his Shetland Pony Toffee easily trod through the three rounds and got the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his plate cap in a frantic angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony that lay far above his age.
And Toffee received best grades for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practised with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great strain."
They had to step against the entire field and left the square with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone fired and slapped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
Just as he started, it won't take long until he's on the horse of the year – and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they beat themselves and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes helped her part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be reformed after a call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation, was to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a member state company.
Now the new expression will be subject to a comprehensive rectification, the regulatory authority said.
The 'Rectification Order' was issued by the Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published some inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly", the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that it had been decided to 'suppose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's license'.
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group was “required to complete the correction of the new expression and recommended that the relevant leaders be identified at the new expression and the management team of the New Express be checked immediately.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published wrong reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the government news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and stated that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug Tunnel with its own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 - by 90 - centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported in it, the authorities explained.
At the time of the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten years of age and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers set up an extensive underground network of washing channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexiko in October, which challenges the drug cartel to quickly bring its product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other.
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actress Orlando Bloom has spoken to separate himself from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is very different from that.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice or a strong Edamer, these dungs are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves from all the consumption of animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains may one wonder, but the vegan world of nutrition is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander vegan lives, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
The next step took place around the turn of the century and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, the artificial leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
First of all, vegan is his ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor, "the maxim of the vegans, which extends to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of mourning after burgers, stir eggs or rubber bears, the veganer quickly discovered completely new products that grew in enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan does not give up, it's not an ascetic, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that with the food conversion you reduce the choice of food options, Proctor rather leads back to the power of habit.
And just these conditionings also made some so well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And apply: "Some tastes are not to be caught on the animal".
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegans explain.
Proctor brings you to a barbecue, such as aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan spices.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which he should taste a lot of it.
Of course you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively on vegan.
"My blood levels are good, I often let myself check," Proctor advises.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 share is high in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator," says Proctor.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor did not have to go far-reaching for food procurement.
After all, there is food everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on site.
I just buy something special from time to time.
"Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive, but this is the case in "common" finished products as well."
In any case, the preparation of vegan courts is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knives you can do well, if not partially achieve better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecakes, Proctor could also bring his parents-in-law to amaze.
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was already confronted with scepticism.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
"I don't deny people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear to be as vegan as it is supposed - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as accepted in general.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's French fries everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates from pasta dishes, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on it.
"When I started feeding me vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people, draw their attention to it."
"If there are sufficient demands, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"The meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor states.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the very largest part of the world impossible," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if one learns to understand what animal additives can also contain in peanuts as a dyer, one seems to quickly leave the courage with following ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only because of this, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients, the food as well as detergents are used.
"After a while you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stop or stumble," white Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral fingernail that appeals to consciousness.
Perhaps he does not quite manage to deduce his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
The trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted in the Friday afternoon.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business freely.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pawns at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the indices of Nasdaq had not been calculated for one hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year alone, there had been two foreheads in a week.
First, the U.S. Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent a lot of bad sales orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the United States came to an end for several hours due to a computer desk on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
In addition, Facebook's stock exchange program had taken care of for a look-out last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the stock exchange supervisor SEC established and donated the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler rounds 63 years old
The accident had been reported by the police when a 26-year-old man was on Thursday evening, around 10:00 a.m., with a women's bike on the left side of the train from the station to the marketplace.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man walked from a local on the walkway, the biker could no longer brake in time, according to the police.
At the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and drew a 15 cm long space wound on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police send an extradition notice to Assange
The British police today handed over a extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that they had given the 40-year-old Australian a 'call to come' to ask him to appear in a police station, and added he should not comply, threatening to arrest him.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition at the beginning of the month.
He was afraid that Stockholm would deliver it to the United States, and on 19 June he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “called on a 40-year-old man to stand with a police guard at a time we have chosen,” said one speaker.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police's request.
Assange fears being delivered to the United States by Sweden and accused of possible espionage after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver who has fallen at 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs receives £1,000 penalty
A car driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to £210 per hour and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police had stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of the court of Colchester, Howie confessed guilty without being the care and attention he needed.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a cost of 90 £ as well as a sacrifice of 100 £.
Taxes on foreign property owners against London's bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of treasurer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments that cost over two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers, who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, revenue from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were at 708 million pounds in the fiscal year 2012/13, accumulated revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the associated legislation against circumvention, one can hardly claim that high-quality properties are too low, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system."
"However, this step could make some foreign investors more restrained as regards the purchase of property in London, or stop owners from selling it," he added.
First class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London South West Belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have earned a record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging 'domestic market' where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as a survey by Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which a dog’s tail swings stand with its mood.
Previous research has shown that lucky dogs with their tail were more welding to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "In humans it is well known that the left and right brain half respond differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for moving the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side of the tail of their comrades, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measure the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the cock moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a true version of nature or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we could thus control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wading dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the fading was mainly left (returning from the dog's perspective, which is conjuring), her heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should be concerned about and when not.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs and you are more connected with the tail in a direction with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers understand their animal's emotions better.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest student at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: “Dogs go to a robotic dog, if its ‘swan’ turns left and not right, instead of becoming restless – just different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore arise that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won't take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves into the one, sometimes into the other direction.

Pope Francis appointed first cardinals in February
Pope Francis was to be appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the Pope's election – this is the case of a group of 120 "elected cardinals".
In an explanation in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, who were also known as the Consistorium.
"Papst Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consitorium in February in advance so that other meetings which require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elective cardinals would probably have decreased by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of elective cardinals would return to 120, and as many cardinals as he would like.
The Consistorium next year was therefore important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a certain overhang of Europe and, in particular, of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding opportunities for reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided all by himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it was "well possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – that is all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called cardinals from large places, but Francis was "full of surprises – we do not know who he is calling".
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat back
General Motors recall nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to fix a problem with manually adjustable seat loans, as announced by the US regulator for vehicle safety on Friday.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting front seats.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal directives for vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
"If the vehicle is raised from the rear, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The supply of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, stated GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperate Cry of an Obama Emperor
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says that Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that have been vanquished by the Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoir on the 2008 election campaign was a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book that I believed it would cheer me up during the sad second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs as the 2008 presidential election.
If I'm done with my patient writings and go to bed in the evening, then the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take a breath.
The election was held as an earthquake victory and a newsman in order to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval values.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I gave my voice for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that party political blockade tactics have shrunk too many aspirations with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after my countless times defending the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why one allows the hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished that reveal state misbehaviour.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it says that the efforts of the White House to calm down the media were the 'most aggressive... since the Nixon government'.
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether or not I should have understood in 18 that government work could contradict the political campaign that preceded it.
Clearly, the parliamentary office is not a predictable course, since a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacre shape the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
With Romney was a confusing and unexplained alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fill the hope that we had heard for so long.
But with the decline of Obama's approval values to under 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so much harder through this book.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a heavy loss on Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electorate after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their business.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters became pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is in a courtial dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars at CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to know if he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are being deleted or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"It is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat in Fairfax with 53 votes.
Palmer called for a revision of the voice-counting process so that it could move faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which to move in, enter the data into a computer, immediately select it and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Today it is incredible to agree with pencils.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously”.
In a public office it was about the service to the public.
"We do not seek any reward except for history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, i.e. two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the suspected manipulations on the currency market is rapidly taking off.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, on which the U.S. dollar changes its owners daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that led to the scandal of the Libor Interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that they had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this topic continue and we fully cooperate with FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation related to the fact that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left RBS 2010 and is now to have been retired from his current position as European leader of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was released this week, and Matt Gardiner, former leader of currency dealers at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these dealers were charged with any misbehavior.
Bankers belonged to the Instant Message Group of Usher at Barclays and the Citigroup, saying the situation was similar to the situation.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that she was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that banks should have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks streamline instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of malpractice.
The news of these investigations has put dealers in an uproar area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to slow down the deal and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to "a market that can be influenced by very low ticket prices".
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds offices after he had caused a loss of just under six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is restricted," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Beechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned up and spread the footpath, says a press release.
The planned cover of the crumbling house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site threatens to slip down.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparency with the message "We are for it" had been applied.
However, this did not interfere with the actions of some 20 members of the citizens' initiative.
Her motto on the big poster was "We're Against Bauruinen".
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project of one day should fail.
In conversation with many passersby in front of the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project will improve many, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city is delaying these answers further, it says from the BI.
As it was to be heard, the mayor's public statements also appear.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he said that he was afraid of being out for the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem just too scared because of this, others feel they are "plump blackmail attempts" at the population, says the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Ranknick shield for Schiris: Mane not a swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Ranknick is with the current high shape of the Bundesliga table guide Red Bull Salzburg is too, so the sports director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is a dangerous trend at present that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category," he took the two offensive whirlwinds into protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became a alleged activism - which of course was none as the TV images showed.
"A severe wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called the referee Harkam "completely overclaimed".
Harkam had also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the captivator.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," said the 46-year-old.
In view of the success, however, Rangnick voted for a loud hymn.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he said.
There's not much to put off.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There won't be any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Besides a player comes with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the Health Act, closely linked to Barack Obama, is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Afffordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the tax authority of the state.
The top judge John Roberts struck the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and also considered that the health law should require states to extend either the conditions of access to medicaid or otherwise to remove all state medicaid subsidies is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been strained by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 campaign.
Norway: Norwegian town makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian town have brought light to their gloomy valley.
Due to the low sunfall, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters high, a century dream was realized on Wednesday.
"At last!", mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the launch ceremony in TV2.
Some valley dwellers were prepared for sun chairs, others for the safety of sunglasses.
So far, sunny days had to go on a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea, however, has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about EUR 615 000) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian alpine village Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Post is not Empty yet on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed the red points for Sunday emptying are still at different letter boxes of the core city and districts, but if you read the small prints on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the emptying of Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," says the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building on Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld was emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still empty Sunday, the answer to the request of the FDP is not answered.
The socio-political and youth spokesperson of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow here.
Sunday learning is an important postal service right at the time of appointment.
"In spite of the rise in the price for letters, this enterprise will be radically and unbelievably out of business on January 2013.
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberals' Group and the City Association, supports his colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here the emptying times are changed or also deleted.
The post is miles away from the city.
"At least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens should also be able to reach a letter box with Sunday learning.
In the city parliament, the city council asked whether the post office is planning discussions on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also provided a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Her party has voted for privatisations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurter Park Fees are expected to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more sensitively expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate advises on a presentation of Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the municipal council still has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibility immediately before the shop was "a not underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The German transport club believes that an increase after two decades is "very appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions overrun host
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to face the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
The apples stood with an experienced team on the other web page.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the cities of joy, even on an age-related basis.
With the hard and placed upbeats the Gunnings were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks, played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz, and were not in the position of the block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all interests.
In view of this depressing and game-determining performance, the third sentence was then won slightly lax and lustless at the 3:0-end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to clear out in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were opposite in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-hit two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused faults and score gifts in particular when accepting the ball; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes flawed and in some critical game scenes the overeifer prevented the view of possible score.
In this highly balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto voted consistently for the great physical effort and a joyful commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cottage
For the fifth day of nursing in the wake of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach.
Due to popular suggestions, this day in the area of the hut the view to the valley should be cut off, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the gleaming piece of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to put their own accents in nature.
At the same time with the tourist aspect, ecological considerations could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Bureau of Freiburg, following the welcome of Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide view is to preserve the old common meadow with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to species conservation.
Tribukait said that she would not at this point fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure does not only apply seamlessly.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition of the life-project as well as the previous care days achieved for the future.
After these various presentations, headmaster Christoph Wehle and Life-Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest towsters may be ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the viewing point.
Löffingen: Köffler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school policy, children, youth and seniors, as well as its own urban works, no second candidate for mayor has yet reported.
As the only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, the 46-year-old banker and business manager Dieter Köpffler from Löffingen, who is no longer a candidate for old age, has so far been established.
The application deadline will expire on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, imposed on Thursday an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was handed over by Nortel in the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the joint property of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents involve technology that brings search terms on the Internet into line with relevant advertising, so the complaint, which thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC create mobile phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which stands in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and finally offered $4.4 billion.
After it was handed over to the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google Motorola acquired mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library on patents.
"Although Google has failed with its attempt to purchase the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the complaint.
Rockstar demands a high damage compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the allegation.
Egypt defends the first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi resigns the office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be sworn to the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He laid the oath before the 18 black robes-dressed judges of the court, who have his seat on the Nile and are copy of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood trained in the USA, a fundamentalist group who, since its founding 84 years ago, had been taken to the sights of the respective government as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building when Mursi arrived shortly after eleven o'clock local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to cheer up the new president, and in contrast to the presidial prunk from the Mubarak time, the traffic was stopped only in a short time, so that the Autokonvoi could cross the usually bustling road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharistic “replacement wheel” of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists but all those who wanted to target the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, explained to the judges in the wood-hewn chamber, in which he laid down the office.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo where he was supposed to keep his speech of engagement.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem he belonged to in respect of.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the university's largest auditorium with speakers of "The army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, established in 1908 as the bastion of secular education, has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the insurrection, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he praised to call back the presidual powers that had taken over the military council from the head of state hunted from the office.
But with the laying of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis' speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discothek "Blue Velvet" began.
Today's Friday evening is called "Pump this party", on the morning Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker crashed from head: severely injured
When a defective outside sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a leader and was severely injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to change a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
As he stepped up on the ladder leaning towards the roof, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Violent in South Africa: Twice Lifelong Detention
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life-long on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC station.
The victim died later from the consequences of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week.
The act had caused horror throughout the country.
The 21-year-old at that time raped Anene Booysen in a industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town in February.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Cana had admitted to being in a bar during the process of having been at night with booys.
He also confessed to having beaten them and raped them, but he struggled to be responsible for the girl’s death.
The police had initially gone out of custody of several perpetrators, but two suspects were released because of the evidence against them.
The prosecutors also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa: every year there are about 64 000 advertisements for sexual violence.
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, there is significantly more population than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa value the dark figures in the case of sexual violence but 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo", the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pork cones, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can hams that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham" as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel does he enter the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo sighted for strengthening at Schnellimbiss in Waldshut
"Here I am working reddish quantities", the TV-maker, black forest ham, as a mass product, amazes me.
16,000 bullets per week speak for themselves.
Weight, percentage of fat, color: Uli explains the importance of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Level TV?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"There I am excited when you read Roberto Blanco what happens then," said Jumbo cynically.
The level of private television is presented here in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that splitting the ropes continues to be manual work.
Because: Black forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with salt.
The smoke tower and smoke fire, Jumbo visually reminds of a "U-boat".
The trick: Tooth branches provide the special taste of the black forest ham in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will allow all participants to live.
You thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now assumes an adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre won eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on a good path towards record year income before interest and tax," he said.
This includes Australia and Great Britain, which typically belong to our strongest producers.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which represents a slightly weaker market for business travel.
It was similar for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the weaker first half of the year due to seasonal conditions, so that a profit is expected for the third consecutive year for the whole year.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are being held to greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onward.
In the test, "unseen texts" are also found to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core compartments will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new admission system and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a 'wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence', stressing that the GCSEs would be 'more demanding, ambitious and rigorous'.
Studies show that less time is spent in English schools for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, it is said from coalition circles that the comprehensive math examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to set up more hours.
The curriculum draws more attention to 'problems from the right life', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious pies attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour strokes will present the circuit association performance show at this weekend in the Burgerhaus.
The reviews were made on Thursday.
Again, the local association W514 is setting up this large exhibition.
Breeders of the Soest County Associations show their rabbits here their best animals as well as young Wicked Hobby Holders.
On Thursday, six prizewinners conducted the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are best informed as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes place Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors from 10 a.m. on Saturday as well as from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m. on Sunday, to which the ceremony will be joined.
The guests are also invited to a tombola equipped with state-of-the-art prices and to a deliciously equipped cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blond curls and appears with a new bubkopf for the first time.
Pamela's blond curls are famous for their role in the Baywatch television series.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star that shocks his fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has separated from its long blond curls in favor of a platinum-blonde shorthair cut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look on Wednesday in Los Angeles and also put a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the sensual change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the Castle is about the theme "To Hell with Hell - theological considerations of today's handling of the last things".
Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical churches of Salem, Salem Castle and the Constance Circle Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to look into the question in the forum, how people today are evaluating the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, and if the pictures of heaven and hell "that shape our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of hope for perfection is more like a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been extended to Christians by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation signs seem to have come out of our hands".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death".
In this connection, the question of that longing is "which dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
She received her doctorate at Dr. theol., also in Freiburg in 1997.
The habilitation of fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at Wilhelms-Universität, Germany.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleinen Heuberg affirm their creed in the firming
Two divine services have been provided to 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral care unit at Kleinen Heuberg.
In the morning, the group of Laudato-Si accompanied the divine service, in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the youths said yes to their baptism and gained the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over the past few months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners, the firmers had prepared themselves for the big festival day.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: 2nd mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hills around the lake.
This tells Ulrich Knobel from the organising sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude, also numerous everyone's cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were able to disengage themselves from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader managed to save a small leap of time to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short-range.
Pascal was once again able to sit on second place.
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it right on top of the winning squad.
Anne Adel came from Lake Illmensee and Leonie driver from Owingen in second and third place.
A gratifying development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute topaths at the start.
Four riders were able to disembark themselves from the regional top riders.
This includes Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate had already been world champions twice in the twelve-hour careers.
This year he became European champions in this special discipline.
With this also Roland Ballerstedt, who already named two German master titles in the duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, there was a winch final in the finish line in front of the three-seas hall.
Pangerl was the first to rush over the finish line.
Only a second later, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as a third of the overall score.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest timer in the main race.
Areane Blersch won second place from Binzwangen in front of Natascha Werner in Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers showed themselves very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance in remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to vote for the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread on his brain and caused a haematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor in Cameroon for every 5,000 people, says the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States is for a doctor of 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffer made the decision in Bwelle to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the tied medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always, everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason for celebration and blazing – with its broad smiles and its boundless energy – is welcome at the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthetic.
Operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the intervention the patients stand up and go into the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a strenuous brush, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it creates a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a breach of performance he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and volunteering in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations that help us to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitation material.
But if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle the almost constant work is no burden.
Helping others to enjoy a happier life and thus fulfill a promise that he has given to his Father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", was cut to death by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier, acting art.
The old man Santiago can't do anything about fishing.
So the two simply complement themselves great.
It's almost like being able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, who is talking about the fishing boy Manolo.
When Santiago sits on the chair tired of life, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish by his knowledge and his will.
Janson is on stage as a solo artist on long distances.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not a moment boring.
His efforts to draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann leaves the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he sets the active scene into the light: Santiago's cottage, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the life feeling of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: Departure to the Romans
At about 120 metres in length, a waste water canal from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, do not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise in the sky and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers can imagine that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The service center of Cologne-Tourism is directly on the Dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a city that was self-righteous, and therefore the rest of the old walls of the city only stood, which was not too large.
Therefore, most of the users of the car park today also rush past the Roman remains and only turn off their car.
But anyone who looks more closely discovers an archaeological site, separated by metal lattice, in the park deck D2.
There are about five meters high ruins of hand plated stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before going back to the daylight, Schulze leaves the participants at the upper park level to take another look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the well of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly seen either.
The next station of the tour is the Pratorum, and here the participants go back down to the depth.
We are experiencing here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Prefector of the CCAA.
What CCAA means would like a visitor to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "the city of Roman right and city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the Praetorium is the former palace of governors, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition, a tunnel entrance leads to the Roman wastewater canal, which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length.
"You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests up.
There's still a little bit of a surprise in Schulze.
After collecting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Micwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Micwe, whose origins go down to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which the construction work will begin shortly.
Until completion, however, a few years will pass.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rocker milieu is rerolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous body injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants were silent.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor's Office asked them to join unknown accomplices in Finovfurt in a car and hit three men.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims should have been part of Hell's Angels' competing group.
One should have been a senior member from Berlin.
Previously, there was apparently a persecution hunt with several cars.
According to the charge, it was about district fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first proceedings in early 2012.
A judge said at the time that it could not have been proved that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the judgment after the audit of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for a second hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody because of another crime.
It was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes at Tattennacht.
As a witness, the Commissioner who was then diagnosed was loaded.
The centre was the phone conversation of the defendants and other persons who had been interrogated by the police.
It is difficult that Rocker in court almost always adheres to a law for them - and does not pronounce.
That also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand that it had appeared new traces since the last proceedings.
Eleven more days of negotiation are involved in the process.
The throwaway company doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bows of the people on the passenger seat and back seat the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one cocktail or another sparkling wine may be responsible for that!
What's closer than chilling to go to the next drive-in to enjoy yourself a little bit?
I admit, I'm happy to join you when it's late-night or early morning to the fast-food shelter.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco fans become evident.
Because what do you have to miss, that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
On weekends in particular, discarded paper bags lie on street edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags home, respectively, to the next trash bin?
It's not just that the paperware shatters the landscape.
Tütten have already covered transport facilities such as control boards and thus caused accidents.
But it is unlikely that "weighing society" doesn't think so, she doesn't even know what that word really means.
When you’re on the road more often in the evening, with several people in the car, you know how a backseat can look after crowded nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are storming.
There would be more or less nothing to do with a couple of things - unlike the street where no one on the rest of the food will trample.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities will have to take out the mess - and the fast food chains have to demand for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal from health policy
According to fierce criticism, yesterday President Obama made a withdrawer in his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of resignation from their insurer, the Republicans threw the president over the last few days before he deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relocated his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to take care of themselves on the free market for a new insurance policy.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government considered it a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have completed insurance themselves would have to cover themselves at a different rate, since their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans quite directly: you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Washington House of Representatives.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement of an adjourned sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with the Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, who was concerned about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated the question as to why the "architectin" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from a state-funded insurance policy in order to charge itself a fee to HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem confirms attack on Syrian air force base not
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news station CNN that some day before, Israeli fighters had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia.
The goal had been "racets and associated equipment" of which the Israeli government feared that they had been destined for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on Thursday in the night of Wednesday, and the Israelis were held responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa missiles and SA-3 rockets were seen, which according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters News Agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, in any case, "We are not commenting on these reports".
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, in part successfully, to deliver ground-air missiles to the Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unparalleled confession that US espionage has "adequately gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated that the US's anticipatory attitude towards its surveillance programmes had been weakened by saying that in certain cases the espionage had "adequately gone too far".
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for putting on autopilot when the explosive revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has entered a diplomatic storm of disarmament on the part of its allies.
At a talk transmitted via video connection at the London Open Government Conference, Kerry said: "Without a question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have almost expired by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was still due to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course to September 11.
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. esp. had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far.'
The President is determined to establish clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not impaired.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its monitoring operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is opposed to killing people, bombing people into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to disperse the concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts, as the president of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats of no longer participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first member of the Senate as a democrat and who serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their annoyance with the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from documents handed down by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy told his authority to prepare the trip of the Congress to be held this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “serious words”.
He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the grudge over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller's use at the FC Augsburg in the Bundesliga playoff of the FSV Mainz 05.
Mainz is involved in the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do it individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeepers with six hits.
The Mainzers have already had to refrain from the injured Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian filed an appeal against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she had reported to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely in her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they were able to figure out the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on site.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back to Australia.
"We are naturally very worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is against a security deposit of 50,000 Baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports it was to be read that she is vacationing in the meantime in the resort Krabi in South Thailand.
On the side of the court was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of the travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, might be trying to improve his attacked tourist image, and that is why it comes to a free speech.
