AM in Wales is worried about "seeing as a puckon"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal is intended to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM across the political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers who can't be Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means paws.
An AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative waleser said that his group is "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context W is spoken in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on the name change, said: "The final decision on what members of the congregation should be called is so clearly up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
The current title of AM proposed by the Commission was Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM seems to suggest other options, but difficulties in reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation on the amendments also includes other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on the disqualification of an AM and the design of the comitology system.
AM can vote on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on the change in the country's name
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's silence when the churches of Harlem encounter problems
"Parents who I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is no such thing."
He said it's understandable that the bars go away.
"People are dating in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Barer is no longer the living room of the area, where people go on a regular basis."
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as far as the leaders expect and that "before or later they will end up on the square one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closing of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black parish led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson’s assembly planned the renovation they also built the watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the watches of the poor".
Experts who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an insatiable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some of whom have been hired by the church's playmates, others by the episcopal foundation.
The church meeting – the congregation’s governing body consisting of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July expressing a concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church meeting, despite the fact that the church meeting had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark hurts a 13-year-old who dives for lobster in California
Last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place shortly before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought the boy was only happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the entire key legs had been worn out.
"I called everyone to get out of the water. "There's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is indicated to be critical.
It's unclear what shark it was.
The Navy captain Larry Giles told the mass media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had traumatized his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours by investigation and safety reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's entering the UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's taking on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with commodity-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the falling of the fashion and household markets, the larger beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more shops next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the attempts of supermarkets to fill the shelves previously picked up by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said that they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with selected areas, as in stores like Boots.
The retail chain also launches its boutique make-up brand again so that most of the products are vegan – which increasingly young customers require.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's shops – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second one will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying less quantities of food every day in local shops means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like a department store in an effort to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stands in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat booths since they bought both chains two years ago, which they believe has increased the sale of food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by Quick Purchase to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boots' sales in the supermarkets were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sale of its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "rare" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal
Dragons The Peter Jones star is "rare" because the TV-presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby can't make it with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their operations have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “racial” at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new agreement – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothing and accessories.
Compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop, the business was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's prime priority.
It would be her long-term future for the decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters of Marlow."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning presenter to withdraw may cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and lights to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mom Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host for I'm a Celebrity on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He was joking that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "indecent a president" and that he was so positive about the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newsman's voice."
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wanted a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step in North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have taken place.
More than three months after the Singapore meeting in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly last Saturday that North Korea does not see a "correspondent response" from the USA after the first disarmament steps of North Korea.
He noted that the United States continues instead sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"North Korea is doing great," he said.
"We were about to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results – an end to missiles, liberated hostages, and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," said Trump, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lomboks had lost their homes, an exceptional permit was not issued, as required for international aid.
"In many cases they have unfortunately been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which complicates everything," said Ms. Sumbung.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesperson of the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for nature's anger.
It has been built tsunami protection in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami alert in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital vessel that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure in her election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and railroads.
However, inadequate funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also pushed by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge signed up for the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was left with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the far pole.
The attempt flew high across the target area towards the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hope and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get into a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach, and I didn't think so much about it, but I just fired."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half after a goal for 25 minutes from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker poured a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spun off near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go by the middle field.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard jumped from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left foot kick past Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to Videoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
Death rate for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
According to the country's disaster agency, the death rate for the earthquake and tsunamine in Indonesia has risen to 832, early on Sunday.
Many people were reported getting stuck in the ruins of buildings that crashed in the 7.5 earthquake that hit Friday and triggered waves up to six meters, said the official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380 000 inhabitants, was full of rushes from buildings that had been destroyed.
The police are arrested, 32, suspected of murder after a woman's death.
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to appear.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get in or get out of the building.
He lost his mind when he found out what had happened.
The housing in the building has been informed that it takes several hours to get back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
She says "it's so awful" over and over.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another one just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's last victim of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Banishment would be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "death" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be dragged into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe Miss Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 1800s and is part of the history of a man who many still think should be hailed.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 1800s than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, the current historical debate is the subject of a proper representation.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the story.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murderer Pig Kills Peanut
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder is ready to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig alley on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan this Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a dirt road nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig in a pig's sty with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pigs had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin identified by the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their property in Massachusetts and caused serious harm to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - kilo pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa for vast rainfall to the southwest USA
As predicted, the hurricane is weaker when it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floods of rain to northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and travels east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching bore will create vast rainfall in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the spreading tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended that someone get out in the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rains can make canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching twig is said to bring local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over an cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and tail roads.
That would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain gets more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may involve intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short intervals.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten-degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great opportunity for warmer temperatures than the average in the Eastern US in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
Over 20 million looked at Thursday's gripping testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have taken place in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh tacked at her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
The number of viewers on Friday is likely to be higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
The average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC were calculated.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
In comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the playoffs or the Oscars gala.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the next most with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the interrogation.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican offices issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators screaming at him when he tried to take a lift to an interrogation with Judicial Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down at the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators yelled at him, which was shown in the live transmission of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when Judicial Committee voted if they would pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, which the minority democrats have claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: The police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims dropped his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogation with Simpson, the police said he confessed that he killed Wayde.
His bail was set at 350,000 dollars, according to Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head and into the neck.
The police are grateful to Louisiana State Police's military force, the police's state law team, the Southern University police force and residents in the area for help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "trouble and striving for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 meter long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Last Friday's morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "wronged" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about things like this all the time," said Wade.
The volcano asks ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered multiple moles and scabs.
Images of social media showed thin layers of ash on windshields in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano standing 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are in contact with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence demonstrators collided with the clandestine police while thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on the session.
A group of masked separatists held back by the clanllpolis threw eggs and color powder on them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battle targets also broke out later during the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups cried out "Never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried out "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by protests, according to local pressure.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region which longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but the participation was low when most of those against the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote at electoral posts in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
"Last year, we had one of our best times.
I saw my parents crying with joy at voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are in favour of independence have found it difficult to keep up the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in custody pending trial about their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been fired by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he is planning to run the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Chairing the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the inferiority we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men — 33, 34, and 39 — have been arrested after a car was driven into a Londonderry house repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 7:30 BST Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the winnings
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not got a lost win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid welcomes Vienna in the Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston extends its winning range to six games – the main coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miles last month.
Livingston misses chances against two visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead far before they scored; their fairness gave Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nodding across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which scored from the middle of the target area.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left alone.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's definite games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge by Glenn Middleton and one in hand – were dismissed.
"Fenonal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff has hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't hold – they only opened the home once – and it's one of the wake-up bells for Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered on smiles and blue skies (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders at breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become confused about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdokan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dubious protests show the divided opinions of a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and condemned as a sovereign of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a crash by car
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The hook took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-traveled road in Deptford in southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and medical personnel were called there, but the man died on the spot.
The hook takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infective accident on Childreners Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been rerouted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Damaged to the Tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in trouble at a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The unrest broke out at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "tornads" have been called there to deal with the concerns involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated in place for minor damage to the face.
One spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those behind it will be referred to the police and may receive an increase in prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison director was reported to be treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances where staff were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the hurricane Rosa's remaining energy pulls forward over the desert of the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border".
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwest of the United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 2.5-5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain is likely to be of use because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
The Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Pink, still with hurricane strength this Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona’s border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and torrents of clay in the desert, as well as rock - mass landslides.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation reported to be "stable."
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the cell phone to appear.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, evil, anger" by the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthlessness and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump to his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered from the evil, anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress last Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusation before the Congress.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal senses of our times, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the coming midterm elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for the most sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "oppose and prevent."
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of ladders
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu City on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach in the dusk and swept many out to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamine came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency BNP, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunami was not alone but dragged cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that tsunami had been traveling on the high seas for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape tsunamine and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 persons were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flight photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are twisted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Post-harvest still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times the amount of nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunamine bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "encumbering" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found in the breach of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is the nearest epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300 000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing us that tsunamine had attacked Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building shouts frenetic warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water crashes against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to an extensive power cut that interrupted all communications around Palu, which made the rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights to you from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for help and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit sites in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from the World Vision in Donggala have gone to Palu where they seek protection during tarpaulins at the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have started the bitter aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if an emergency permit is issued following a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it's a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status hasn't been announced yet."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that sparkle gloomy natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who was in a hurry for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subando, the trainer of Indonesia’s National Screen Flight Team, had trained two of the missing screen pilots in front of the Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were his students.
"As a screen flying vet, I have a burden of my own emotional stress," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the screen savers heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent desperate whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got a grey goat, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 under ATM at Newport on the Livee
Last Friday's morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a bank account at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The drivers of the car had emptied a ATM at the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators shall contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rape couple change their name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter last Saturday and said, "The value that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which was suspended for "emotional reasons" according to the creators of the program.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he spoke about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, we are.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only' to Ye only – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico’s AMLO pledge not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Forces fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left - wing student movements were raging in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate training opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the United States does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of being a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
A double-size budget could double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on an AI system that hit the highest rated American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the US government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, said Lee.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the US with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students within AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants grants to people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in months.
Macedonia’s referendum on name change
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum if the country's name is to be changed to "North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which has prevented its attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether if the 50 % minimum participation required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question of the waltz in the referendum is this: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But the name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing the name if it makes it possible for Macedonia, one of the countries that was formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order to consider it decisive.
The name change requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 o'clock.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and put out chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to well-needed investment in Macedonia, which has unemployment of over 20%.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80% of our citizens are for Europe and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a confirmation of our future.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Survey Institute, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters thought to vote in the referendum, which falls below the minimum required participation.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants were expected to vote on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
For the referendum to count, 50 per cent of registered voters must vote plus one.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-oriented government policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes over all of Brighton's defenses to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling struck Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win at 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made his way around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a fit to Sterling to the left.
The English forwarder used his first kick in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has a problem with her feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made goals in that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial take-over in the Premier League game.
The target arrived in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's revir on that game.
He sent a nice kick off the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before it got out of range.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the end game, so there is no reason to force one to begin.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance for the finals.
Rockies got a wild card site with a win of 5-2 over Nationals this Friday night, but is still looking for its first division title.
"We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their starter for Sunday yet, but according to reports they are leaning against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen last Thursday and would throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed thrower is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Keeps Numbers in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the coming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I can't, but I can't. That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, horrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take power back whatever it takes, you see their evil, terrible.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, are fighting to "stand back and stop."
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "argue and evil and horrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator, Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judicial Committee, which was addressed by a high level of public awareness.
"Do you remember what she said?
"Did you leak the document?"
"Eh, eh, huh?
No, not, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They do not tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I'm the last one in a series of Labour MPs to hear that we're not welcome, just because we're saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically enough similar to those of Jeremy criticised previous leaders for.
In the communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour last Friday, it said that "we want meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has been forgotten long ago, if ever it even began.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leaders accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues whom I previously thought had a similar political vision as I expected I would turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was the security of the nation or the internal market of the European Union.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – follows a tidal line of ignorance on social media that requires me to be set aside, criticises my policy and says I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just hit me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues as they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this policy of yours is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every distrust and change in the rules of selection, the party becomes all narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so it's gonna be okay.
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the failure of thatcher's government, which literally led my elementary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to you who promoted the appeal on Friday that when the country approaches a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why someone would like to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the party leaders of Labour.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no great deal of threats about devoting myself or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I consider to be best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave home team profits, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested during our games so far and are still unbeatable, so we're obviously happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in 14 minutes, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card to Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was let in by Warriors for the game, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempts, which were converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It then became a long wait for a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the reboot, Ayr led again increased with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayrs acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line-out behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flank Gregor Henry away for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game-Star Ford Kühr seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it has been discovered that he has been nominated as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, in which he writes and plays along with his long-standing comedi partner Greg Hemphil.
The duon has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kühr seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's CEO of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kühr wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowery restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastal Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a richly covered headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The bases of the fleet from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to recover it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s is still strong – and it is also a longing to sail again on the Pacific.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first of October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a atmosphere of unity and peace, and obviously awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court's decisions on large screens across the country, hoping that the court of The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them a separate outlet to the sea.
Monday's decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial re-election struggle next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court judge in favour of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it did.
The Court of Justice of the United Nations, based in the Netherlands, is not entitled to allocate Chilean territory and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And over the past four years, more than promoting Bolivia’s chances, may have been damaged.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale’s aggressive rhetoric has affected Chile’s remaining well - being.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so afterwards.
The two countries have not replaced ambassadors since 1962.
Before this President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realise that we must move forward from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires confidence in the United States
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the line to resolve the deadlock of nuclear diplomats more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "threat" to continue sanctions and the US protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang starting significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a gun arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line huge headbands on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a variety of shaky, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the stylics of the Paris fashion week.
Unbelievably impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their eyecatching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's first creation was an exuberant beige hat with a feather-like wide hat breast that completely took over the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple – but they are not intended to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in due time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet suit with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass strut.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge highs can be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a brim of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that was behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that held it.
The Raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia francs and a white leather handle, was excellent in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
The kändisstylist Luke Armitage said to FEMIIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sports, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement adapted curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, he'll be at his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final exam Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of students who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering knowledge and mathematics at curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
With this in mind, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs demanding language skills, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of career choices, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent responded that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came into total in a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered to be most important for Britain before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
In a global economic environment it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capability".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edward is head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make the debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first season match of Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's been playing has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In anticipation of a confirmatory vote by its candidate for the free post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build up support for future interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress before the forthcoming elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's questioning of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense after accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the vote from the Senate of up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November elections.
Thus President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to "engage volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and extend the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
The night's events, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been stalking in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to increase his opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a state vet at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is struggling to keep hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the competitions last Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever in front of competitions like these.
So what momentum is this about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we carry it like a small momentum I guess" said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points of advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the sails, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and precedes by example.
The winning trope scaled higher as his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had left with two after two games.
His putt that won them the match of 15 met with a similar bang, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's undisputed story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the audience's reactions establish that they are the players to turn on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could bring home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, together with Alex Noren.
One bowey and two doubles on front nine lowered the Spaniards and the Swedes in a hole that they never even came near to crawl out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead for the last day, but this four-some session also showed that Team America has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the part of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of Saturday's fours ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who struggled to keep the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started in the morning's 3-1 four ball.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it did not suffice for victory.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is just the second couple to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the matches, they beat a exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more repressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who made his way through two games on Saturday, proved in isolated moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in foursome and foursome, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's four ball and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe had no wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three times winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They made home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in foursome and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team has come back from a base of four points in the single matches, but Furyk's side only needs an undecided result to keep the cup.
After being next best for two days it looks like a moth attack on Sunday may be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that they "never" will disarm unilaterally without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations last Saturday to continue sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible for it to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea had taken "significant measures to demonstrate its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing installations and promising not to disperse nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any equivalent response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a step-by-step approach to nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution completely like Pyongyang previously.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US President-in-Office's sitting meeting with a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the decommissioning of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has applied for a formal end to the Korea War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected negotiations to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "decommissioning first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion and even object to the "declaration of ending the war," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wish for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the United States leaders highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the USA, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have reached such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the mainland of the United States with rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take measures to disarm, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realise a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then told him to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of making "gongster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear power complex about the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and is moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has got all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "dyings".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often imaginative about the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, during my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly rate includes a number of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students directly.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in the "dive" still exists," he says, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in starvation and makes them starve constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has studied one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they start their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can make you turn around 24 hours a day, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas targets lower Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 down team in Livingston.
The Ibrox site was looking to take home its first victory on the road since February 4-1 Triumph on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga beat to seven minutes before halftime and Rangers never managed to smooth out the results.
While Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind the Hibernian on target.
And there may be more problems on the slope of Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a headache after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
Holt on the other hand went with the same Livi 11 who scored a score of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-killed games passed over the opponents each time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
There should have been goals already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass let through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep frispark from Keaghan Jacobs then reached the captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
Rangers took control of the game, but it looked to be more hope than belief in their game during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo surely felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the judge Steven Thomson waved away from the Colombian appeal.
Rangers managed to do only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily took Lassana Coulibaly's neck and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shots in 34 minutes may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their servant deserved it.
Once again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher came to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the prey gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly jumped from his line to block the experiment.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett who spewed up long fit after long fit.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed well to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for punishment when he was tamed with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from the Almanac of Sunday: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geigermeter.
Geigermeter has become a foundation stone of science since then and is also a major figure in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the leading role in the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger meter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms produced by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then reinjected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognise cancer, saw her ovary cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2 and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "produces the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked when treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was built out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swimming performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would run for entry in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he had a Make America Great-Keps, he rallied against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee about the accusations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the performance of West's interpretation was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to run West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headband.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to fall low too?" and said he would "put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Test with love."
His comments attracted more cages at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said, "There was a death sentence in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with their appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TO TAKE TO STOP THE MOBBEN."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "self and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") whom I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are, too. She added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkollan, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
They're trying to kill for knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackmore, the police said.
The respondent is expected to arrive at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington beats toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is known for its sword-hanging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actor in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "likely strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV can partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculineity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued "What is native and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, making young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big issues of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series came to an end next summer and said that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife because of the series, so that way it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygrette, as Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family owners in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says the health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an acute issue in the Chinese HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will marry women sooner or later.
Many cases of infection are due to insufficient protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that personnel have leaked the GOP senator's records, cover "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday claims that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies and more horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites that Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false claims - were by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly got criticism online, including from White Huset's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't, they can't be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the cause of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensed."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the critics' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to set up Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great about true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entity for these fraudulent demands.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless Spy Parodi by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit services in each new film with British slope, and the same applies to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodies that were kicked into 2003 with Johnny English and got a new life 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Are sharp satirs about how manifestly bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has received its license to customer to business renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comical creation intended for bio-public even in non-English-speaking countries
He is, of course, the crazy secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims on smoothhieglamour has received a little bit of Clouseau, a spark of Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There's one or two great moments in the last JE movie.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the rotor blades hit his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor is quite low and strangely superfluous, especially since the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humorn feels as if it's suitable for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English strangely invented not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film grandfather in the role of Bean.
The subject at issue is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents in the field, to the agent in the great dissatisfaction of service - an immensely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when each active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any wealthy institution, but who offers unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover at the side of.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lasting sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to the wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and run into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims that he can solve Britain's computer troubles: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey of far-sighted inventions: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-moving, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderately everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for British to work a four-day week but getting paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a radical plan that is based on the British working a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
The party wants to transfer savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would be "fit" with the party's economic agenda in favour of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
One representative higher up in the Labor said to The Sunday Times: An audit of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits into the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the party The Greens who promised a four-day working week during their election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
One Labour spokesperson said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and there is nothing the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "unseemly leaders" and "smart" on state companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders in water companies cannot recover their entire efforts, as a Labour government can do "deduction" because of what they perceive has been wrong.
He also confirmed plans to put workers in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10% of the private company's capital is transferred to its employees, which are then to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell us in their 60-minute TV program about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the Office's investigations could have some Republican senators change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seems irrefutable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite tank," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive display of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people waving to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizens Festival is an extension of the Global Power Project, an international support group that hopes to be able to combat poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, ringing or in other meaningful ways contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been with 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" – people who feel that they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered by its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that represent more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that so far the accumulated assets have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and stakeholders involved in "helping children develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help combat malnutrition in the area after having received more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can make social injustice that is an entertainment note in history," said the ambassador for the Tracey Ullman Partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5000 measures requiring Britain to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programmes targeting 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on its website: "What makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered the Global Citizen: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's events in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports indicating the Home Secretary
The government can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, have been exposed by US Home Secretary Ryan Zince, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - particularly where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The U.S. has the ability, with our fleet, to keep the waterways open and, if necessary, apply them blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative vis-à-vis Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-end" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
After the management of the Trump administration has been aimed at increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin the "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington's resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position was backed up by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading trade organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly disagree that a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia's president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "orderly thinker" if she is to stand up in the presidential election 2020," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "orderly thinker" about her participation in the presidential elections after the U.S. Mid-Year elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a serious thinker to run for the president's office."
Warren weighed in to President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been eloquent in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "believable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator shouldn't be running, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The study showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidateship include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Bid said he would make official decisions in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking up employment in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through now that he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a report on domestic violence and armed possession in drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, reported NBC News.
Full name of the claim in the case Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members' sons," abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems of domestic gangs and violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape from domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the Friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the American economy and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour".
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered in June judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu when the death rate doubles in the pursuit of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more gloomy.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance is picking up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a shortage."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rotting through water-damaged possessions, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, injured in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershock.
With tearful eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't run.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page advertisement in an American daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the fact that China Daily paid an extra in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the US's 6th Congress election, something that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with higher tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s reimbursement tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump’s Republican party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and the former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "doubts the bullying by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"China's government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper record on the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have about China's troubled economy, because the media are controlled by the iron hand by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbled the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters from the middle-year election through Kavanaugh fiasco, warning analysts
Since many top republicans defend the high court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several accusations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that a setback, especially from women, will take place during the upcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is not possible to turn back the clock," says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will suffice to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning the demonstrators "November will come!" when they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building when the Republicans controlling the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Already before Ford's public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about Kavanaugh, it is also about how republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, head of the United States of America, a group helping democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has made, as well as those from at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate court committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that that candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to make-lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data."
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available at the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on the high edge overnight.
"We're not asking them permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee switched the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Viktoria Cross during the First World War
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the shot line and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble about."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "knew himself very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and got to see Greta Gris instead
Imagine this, you've stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The San Jose show included 13 games, including sex on the main board and was displayed live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after they had stayed awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan at Twitter described the program change to a signed children's program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution as far as the reprice is concerned," said Coker.
"But there is six in the morning on a Sunday there and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical fault.
But in fact, that was a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over the head in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "the inferiority" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his comrades when they grew up because of his sexuality - but it also spurred him on to success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavanne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular program leader, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time performance on Lavene's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worthy of me and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he didn't let everyone down when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for HBT rights and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to convince more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without limits and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that his infatuation in a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OS at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad didn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally confessed he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a local audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the Olympics and that still gave him Russians.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he must fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Fury for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the fivefold winner spent his day between acting cheer and practicing his game in the hope of having a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the rake of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape before the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long fox often punishes severely misses.
It is not only the banana that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday Mickelson meets the master Francesco Molinari, who together with the novis Tommy Fleetwood has won all four games this week.
If the Americans, which is 4 points below in front of the 12 single matches, have a winddown at the start, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a clapping on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's the way it is, and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully lived up to the heights of his individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Fury said his presence brought other qualities.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was nice to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last single of today's Ryder Cup can quickly change to an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under the Seve Ballestero leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but who finally won with the smallest possible margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds you that we led big on Valderrama, we led big on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and nagging," Bjorn (in the photo) said after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply, and that is a completely different thing.
It is fun to be out with a partner when you are doing well, but when you are out there on your own, your capacity is fully tested as a golfer.
It is the message you need to convey to the players, to get out the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also go and get out the best of himself."
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furik will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Fear itself has been on both sides of major turns during the last days of a contest, both in the winning team in Brookline before he stopped as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had gathered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts one way, there will be a lot of pressure on these middle matches.
We made our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meet Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said about his single choices.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", led ship for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-Fregatten, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-Diskningen which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen crews.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air-to-air and maritime missiles, as well as some smuggling techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already out of date when they are put into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125-fregue created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "mjuquaru and hardware errors" that rendered the warship worthless if it was used on a battle mission.
Weaknesses in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It also emerged that the ship has a significant excess, which leads to a deterioration in its performance and limits its ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price tag - including crew training - will also be a problem.
It is said to have been staggering EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared with EUR 2.2 billion at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's sea power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "begins to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said that this is a growing problem, as old ships are being dismantled but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust candles to the secret life of bats
New research carried out at a property in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and contribute to directing future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will follow south and dwarf pipework as well as brown loan making and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed spatial picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how to best maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Flat - muscle populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects livestock and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as airplanes and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from hazelnuts.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, inspect the nest and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of vets and a lot of favorable habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasizes the importance of searching for bats before undertaking maintenance in real estate, since it is possible that accidental destruction of a single home could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly annihilate an entire population.
Fladder mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He claims to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) turned off the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the demands were reported.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-time balloon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to vote for Der Spiegel on allegations, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity," according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral injury to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the betrayal of the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "afraid of retribution" and was concerned about "being humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if one lost their status as world leader in auto manufacture after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement they will temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem concerns what the car manufacturers say is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, this could lead to cross-border disruptions that the industry says may lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and of which production would be forced to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that enables, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated, but for us to take this opportunity." he said to the BBC Radio 4:s program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must definitely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said, "We have presented an exact and credible plan for our future relationship with Europe."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again," says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the president's potential barrier to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility to wear wires to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility to dismiss the President via the 25th Amendment of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports of his departure appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee interrogation where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual immorality, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a one-week postponement with regard to all other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would contest the claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters "playing for the gallery," although she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several questioning sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence, "We've been looking at these numbers."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "If the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot over the past few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland for concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of closed status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, with decisions expected to come this autumn.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health care and benefits the patients and societies we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after being hit by a main injury in Saturday’s loss with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee’s Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage happened just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the hospital Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no data on the type/covery of the damage than" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a high-class second-year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp taxes when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory’s new plans
The measure will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamping tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The British Ministry of Finance expects up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of housing with more affordable prices and aiming at high incomes.
The increase in stamping tax will be taken out by individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee will be paid in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in leisure dwellings and dwellings purchased for rent, which may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will recover up to £120 million per year.
An estimated 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold on the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new play comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first dwelling.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on dwellings at affordable prices to resolve the "deployable housing situation" of Britain.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a prominently sufficient proposal for housing reforms, including rent roofs and an end to compulsions without the blame of the tenant.
He also wants to give municipalities a greater opportunity to build new dwellings.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life should be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy homes that work hard in our country.
The dream of owning your home has become too many people a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland."
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is to ever become the coach of Scotland.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from north-east England, currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after having led St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-country team and that's all," says Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it's always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Ross' representative for Sunderland is Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a big club. He has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I am now assessing success based on the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club definitely belongs in the Premier League, considering its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably only see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period of assisting coaching in Dumbarton and a 15-month sejour as a member of Heart's coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa to come back from the descent to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close to the descent to become the winner of the championship title the season after.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkurk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembers and refers to when he took the command of Alloa.
"I really thought that leadership was absolutely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had okay results and could live on it. In addition, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
There's still stress and pressure on the job for me, but practicing feels absolutely right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I do it. I feel better than I've ever done in my entire adult life."
Listen to the whole interview in Sportssound, Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00
A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday.
The summer's heat wave has meant an increase in revenue for the country's struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have got more pressure on them.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from the CGA company, which has compiled the figures, said: "Consequently beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared with June, when the pubs rose by 2.8%. However, the restaurants had even more difficulties.
The 1.8% reduction in the turnover of restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pupils offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
Outlays on managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and sales of food down by 3%."
Paul Newman of the catering and entertainment analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in sales on the wholesale kitchen market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a 4.8% reduction in sales per year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have been more convenient for companies run by food sales. Time is allowed to show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any well-needed respit."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub- bar- and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses data on the performance of 47 active groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
A survey shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in the number of false Instagram sites
The result has increased concerns that there is sexual content that is put up there
20% of the students indicated that they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta Accounts", a reference to the Instagram photo division service.
The result has been late on concerns that there is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of the students stated that they have a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
According to the study, carried out by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmitressesses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Board of Directors of the Scottish Free Sport Federation, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Executive Board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Governing Body's Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious sports athlete, and the President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sport to take advantage of her broad experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the athletes of Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at OS in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator at BBC. He lost his ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that if I were to recover, the time was to be spent, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all your encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows sharing the Internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that get milked.
To highlight the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable chest pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with humorous appeal to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real mothers dance in a tall barn with cows to a song with text lines like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know it, this isn't a juver, but tits."
The reference continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused strife on the Internet.
The film has received 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, and has encountered mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it sheds light on the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and fed in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them only a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comment: "It is understood that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another adds: "What a reality-absorbing advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterical fun."
"I think this is genius.
I'd have got one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercials are a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," someone writes.
Another comment: "This is a fun commercial film that turns to mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like 'kiss'."
This isn't a movie that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a suckling bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to lighten breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in an entertaining and easily recognizable way we show what incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrants quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of dependent migrants has increased even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the violent rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the government of Trump, making it more difficult to place the children with reference persons.
In the past, most reference people themselves have been paperless immigrants, saving themselves to risk their own opportunities to stay in the country by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, witnessed to the Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for reference to lone minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since earlier.
"Almost 80% of those who are either referees themselves or family members of reference persons are illegally present in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be admitted to court within one month of their being deprived of liberty, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to the staff at the premises.
Many of them are present on the video link rather than personally in order to bring their action for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of liberty, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempted refugees, according to the staff on the premises and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns rise at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without getting enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and say good - bye to friends, the traumas of many are already wrestling with.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish "ocupational forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, accusing "certain Western countries" of "spread irrational fear" that induces refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebel party Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ruled off a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-connected Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
The UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government members and members of the opposition shortly to prepare a draft post-war Constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and said that the work of the Group would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless his presidency ended prematurely through national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
At present, there is no evidence that the viewers have become tired.
Since 2014, the viewing figures at best transmission times have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because that's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a comedian of many years and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Nell Scovell tells me.
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, reporting from Washington can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the welfare of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and looked for six hours at an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostriches for $15,000 ("a garment filled with hybrids", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's makabra descriptions of Donald Trumps, hmm, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating role crew and daily intrigues (muse quarrels with NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single section, you get on your back.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, there were suns and 27 degrees outside his house on the northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and engulfed indoors watching MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not tire out, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wave.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the evenest race ever before the Mid-Year Choice
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania receives a lot of money, because of the restructuring of a congress district that has made two members compete for the same place now.
This recently rewritten suburban district in Pittsburg is represented by the democrat Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were restated after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were constitutionally altered to the advantage of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign finance dispute between the main parties' economic sections, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a small win in a wide-guarded special election in March to the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
That place had been held by a republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the democrats a certain advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for China's support but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners rolled up the Trump organisation's team of leaders.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to call home the heads of the U.S. Missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "new decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said the department spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions against El Salvador were planned, which was estimated to receive USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control and development and financial support.
The sanctions proposed, including reduced financial assistance and visa restrictions targeted, would have fought hard against the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued to progress, US and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now going to speak at the conference, which is now due to take place in mid-October. It is a sign of the importance of the presidential administration's meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
One speaker for John Bolton from the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three American officials, of whom two diplomats agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study history
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse of justice, as there is now considerable evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that assembly just when he prepares to once again stand up in the elections, and perhaps finally in front of a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the struggle can be extended.
In 1938 German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had opposed him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the inevitable emergence of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, the kick?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this magazine reported that he was supposed to have proposed to secretly record the president, and wondered that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not correct.
"How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress holding Donald Trump responsible in the middle-year elections?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Chechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me away to light sabbatical lights on the table decorated with the crosshairs.
With it as a legacy, how could I be other than optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that winning the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended unexpectedly earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented the middle fielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2 match against Villarreal. However, he believes Rangers can use the result as a leapboard against greater success.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
We might have got it in the end, but in the big picture, it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second half, and we were the better team.
Now on Thursday there will be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can probably pull out and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, there were few who talked to their family members about it.
About half the people who participated in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want to have care. Your choices may have a major impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term financing may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own resources, if you can afford.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Establish a medical authorisation, so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks over your medical care and ensure that your health care staff comply with your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a mandate for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Could you then answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"Not only the economy is at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.

Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready."
Fired several times with guns in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air rifles as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "single event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It records officials. The death rate is expected to rise.
The communications are closed, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain information from the Donggala administration area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated at 379 800 persons in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area that extends along more than 300 km of north-western Sulawesi coast.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region in a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 in 2017.
The pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesis are fisheries and agriculture, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesia disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996 Western Donggala was struck by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circum pacific seismic flow, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh Province on northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami affecting 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1 100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten metres was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A fundamental earthquake affected the administration area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the death of the earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was suspected of domestic violence, of having been involved in a domestic violence report and of having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su Penitentiary and is held against the bail of $500 to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of bail, according to KTUU television channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to state his position, according to the television channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious Class A crimes, which means that he can get up to one year in prison and $25,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious crime in Class B, which is punished with one day in prison and 2,000 dollars in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of being involved in the notification of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after connecting her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami crossed the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors insist on the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, must have used a construction and interior chain rental car Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He chiseled pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body damage, according to the intent of the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both indictments may constitute a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, often used by federal prosecutors in the cause of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "substantial planning and deliberate planning," said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way that Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clives, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has not been prosecuted in a case where the death penalty is claimed in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder by two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to lifetime imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple Rosenberg was executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, submitted a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be set up in his hospital room, the police reported.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "apparently disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to invoke the death penalty instead of going to lifetime prisons without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant admits guilty only extends the traumas caused by these events to all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to invoke the death penalty.
Tories' MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at Torie's conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel the heat" from the EU-sceptics when one of Theresa May's own MEPs proposed that he conduct negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member, Peter Bone, said on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already "have gone out" if Nigel Farage had been the Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge that Theresa May faces in getting the deeply divided supporters to reconcile has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under attacks by the Brexitists, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press on and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force EU-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the organization Leave Means Leaf in Solihull that he wanted to "spola Chequers" the agreement.
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood by the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must flush the Chequers agreement."
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world war to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The belief that the British would have changed and now wanting to remain remains is entirely untrue."
The Brexit fan Andrea Jenkyns from Torypartiet was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and with our electorate who are on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put aside the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Prime ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians need to be "feeling hot" if they were to fail the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not gonna let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved with banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"These are the people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technologies for Canada plus the plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a clean father's.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "orderly thinker" about running to the president's office.
The American senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "reasonable thinker about running to the president's post" after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe magazine reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke of their future at a townhouse meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now preparing for re-election in November against the Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy Chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's been under speculation that she might get to Donald Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for the president's office.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means a woman on top.
One person arrested for the killing of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 p.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to get help identifying a man who is seen on the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," said Sheriff Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went in between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been on site and had a gun, and he confessed that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and brought to the custody of the East Baton Rouge police.
Sims was junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starting last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world championship title after the team order gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's team command would play a major role in the race.
Bothas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on a drought when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went down first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the cliff, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward for a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of inviting in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstapp started in the back row and lay seven at the end of the first lap on his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the decks to reach a quick finish and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived in the depot of the 44th shipyard but failed to speed up during the remaining eight yards when the Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the witness from Ford before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "lack, ugly and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, ugly and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't darkened Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential as she wished."
But her dementi doesn't seem to have fit the president, as during Saturday's meeting it commented this way: "I'll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power back with all the necessary means.
One sees their wickedness and generosity. They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control,” said the president according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars' soned the loss on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 returns match in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received early two-way guidance through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed up for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth session of the season for the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening speech came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assistance from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who signed off at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Belfast Giants were in charge at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again quit with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the winnings with his team's fifth half way through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to allow hundreds of people on a plane to escape from earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the hurry in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian television channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from Balikpapan at Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are devastated to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll can rise to over a thousand people. The country’s disaster relief authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the administration.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
There's no clean water.
The mini-markets are looting everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes earlier this year at Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport of Chuuköna.
Officials stated on Friday that seven persons had been hospitalized.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane slipped past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through deep middle water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the 30 - foot - deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analyzer draws up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's page concluded his plea in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone records to put together the 29-year-old appealed to Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims, reported the news newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "is lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final launch on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hiphop has come far from its origin in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make hiphop consciously popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been boosted in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
A nanny in New York is suing a couple because of the termination of a "racial" text message
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminating dismissal after she received a misguided text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racist and compare the mood with "expression".
The two-child lady Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she realized that the new child girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEY NOT A SWART IGEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, the Plasco-Flaxman was "illa to the mods" and fired Maurice, claiming that their former child girl, who was African American, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal. She requests compensation in the amount of 350 dollars a day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would be six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't," she said to the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple turned down the accusations that they would be racist and say that the only straight thing was to finish Giselle Maurice's job, and they were worried that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood with "expressing" and said that his wife was going to have children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Should you walk on such a person?
It is not very nice done," added Plasco, an investment banker.
The justice process is still in progress, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn't think the readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
Paddington writer Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, considering what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "very important member of our family", and added that her father was proud in the silence of his final success.
"He was quite quiet by himself, and not some arrogant person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who manages something. You get proud of the child even though it is not you yourself who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington his own glory."
My daughter would die, and I got to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken on an en route to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that one did not expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs that doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was extinguished.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t read or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bent my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women set up postcards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She says her son was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
"All knew who he was because of his smiling.
They said that his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling after he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quietly, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, has lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
"He hadn't said he felt depressed or depressed or something," she says.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was on the ground, and when the children opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it. "There's a wound in the family.
It rips us apart.
But we all have to fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches investigations
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we might get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would be "split" because of deeply rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the time.
The Mid-Year elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want to have chosen to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would mean that Vice President Mike Pence can break the deadlock and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean depoppers "sunks" under Kim
The number of North Koreans leaving South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-soog, which quotes data from South Korea's Ministry of Reunion, says that 1 127 people jumped out last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that stronger border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges to human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
The majority of North Korea's demisers are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans must have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korea War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korea states.
China sees its hopes as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks with a focus on the fixed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions of lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we certainly cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally affected, and occasionally he almost screamed and the voice staggered when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, saying that the accusations against him were a "great and coordinated murder of character" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh into the courts if he became elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is now in," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judge in the appeal court in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might be taken against the Health Insurance Act Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the position of a hysterical and partisan person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And she kept going.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to cause some outbursts of anger because they are often misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was taken into the collar of an older woman. It was a cool boss that I had always been a little scared of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they think you're happy because they were able to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital shop on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of setting up himself in the presidential elections.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates already. The last one they needed was one more.
Someone called it the Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was late out, she was left with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate unless she got two million dollars together.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice staggered.
"One could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls about the press's reactions.
"One could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my gravestone?"
"She cried?"
Why the trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The opening stage in the trade war between the US and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the breakup between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by coating important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the US from China are subject to customs duties.
Peking has answered each time with the same coin. Recently, the fee of between five and ten percent on American goods for 60 billion dollars was tossed.
China has promised to match the US's actions, and the world's second largest economy will probably not step down in the foreseeable future.
Making Washington back involves bowing to demands, but public crawling for the United States would be far too embarrassing for China’s President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards right, the press from the US Trade War can give positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies on each other.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, research assistant with focus on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to accept voluntary return refugees and appeal for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it did not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final score 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutively on European soils and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the end of the 16th hole par 3-track, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari gleamed in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth emerged 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranked players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest rated player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He left the baton to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I am grown up to look at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all their four games in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for their career in Ryder cup.
A curious statistic for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S. struggled all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furik said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work on the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us."
Algflowering: The slopes of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algal flowering concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
Algflowering extends over 20 miles [20 km] of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles out into the sea outside the big municipality Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algflowering has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside Hillsboroughs coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida this past week.
