Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
At the meeting, however, it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement building and rejects Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The deal between the Iranian nuclear programme and Obama has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, Netanyahu held a controversial speech, which was sometimes considered to be an affront against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb it was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was scratched on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." According to information from the authorities, he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already taken 300 miles to the school grounds, where according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that some time after that, Lamb made the fatal emergency call.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police chained him.
One day after shooting at the university, students and teachers forced themselves to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctoral thesis, for which the Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to work as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving the campus, the police later found Lamb's track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
In 2009, Lamb began his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in spring in Pedagogy.
One of Lamb's longtime friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met with friends together.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's black man at the time.
All the girls melt when he was there," said Hairston, now 40, and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer annual market three years ago.
Later they played together one gig or another.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night the last time 5 September after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica play before a sparing audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
On Tuesday evening, at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, some 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight Memorial celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
Lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Waster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call called Prentiss called his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season workers as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it was planned to recruit 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start applying this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees to sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film starts, and it makes me think that I'm a simulated goose and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "indisputably the biggest time travel film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join forces and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation indelible."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the face of the crisis in Syria that they demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is taking seriously.
Some have tried to brand him a flop.
Others took him for a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks on polls down, it has not (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit area, and some start to seriously ask themselves what it means for the nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the term of office.
Nobody claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom even won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a transient phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfying" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "disgusted" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "enraged" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republican voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his duties, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their scholarly huts, Republican voters hold Trump for real.
When asked who wins the GOP nomination the closest, according to a survey by CNN/ORC from last week four out of ten, Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28% for Mitt Romney's final candidate.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership while anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they've formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his election campaign friends two months ago, immigration was a turning point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do it too.
Frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
At Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the Republican electorate's support now escapes, mainly due to their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated by the Republicans at Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "helstärtisch aggravated".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg you will find the most expensive residential complex - with views over the North Sea Watt.
In the street a square meter of a reed roof house costs on average 73,300 euros.
"The offer of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - that is, the high price.
A new study shows in which specific layers a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square metre for a student basket in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places of residence, one of the prices occurs like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residences - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are once several ten thousand euros nothing - per square metre, well noted.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top of the list, by way of exception.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller opened the way to a worthy 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in Piraeus' witch boiler.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their debut in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in the hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hits (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th start-up success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the handlepot to Munich in the third run.
Müller received good help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto at his 28th matches in the Champions League for the Bayern leadership, which had one shot of the world champion thought to be a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.668 hot-flowered fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without gleaming.
Piraeus had won his latest six home matches in the king's class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
==References====External links==
But the Bavaria, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously went about their offensive efforts, but often too inconceivably at work.
The attacks were too often initiated on the left side of Douglas Costa, who rarely came across against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half-field hit in the left upper torke.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion forgot the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First, when Ideye Brown, Olympics stormed the pole's headball from the line (26.).
Then by direct deduction, the Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to play her dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needle stitches.
On Torhüter Manuel Neuer, however, was abandoned.
For instance, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a chain of four with David Alaba in the center, alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, was first sitting outside.
After the final training, the World Cup hero gave green light, the sports director Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "Who wants to make something else out of it, that's already bad."
Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it clear 13 minutes later, at eleven meters Müller put another one on it.
Before the game, Krawallen had arrived in the stadium.
After a small group of partially mutilated Bavarian fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and fought against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes not only hurts the lung but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: In case of abandonment, the risk falls quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of premature loss of teeth was higher in the 2.5 to 3.6 subjects.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammation of the gum, the DifE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, however, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years to restore the threat to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
People had to be convinced to become non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing of the DIFE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, also leads to good dental health up to a high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DifE reported.
Previous investigations have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists bump into the remains of Cologne's Rhineinifer from the Late Antique
For the time being, archaeological finds have been made on the right Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always attracted as a specialist in archeological memorial care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were discovered.
From text documents it has already been known that in place in the 4th century there was a fortress and in the 8th century there was a church, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman has been injured at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning about 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the track from the railway station building at the end of the trainway and was caught by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the federal police, she has suffered the most serious injuries by capturing the train.
She was treated on the spot in an emergency and brought to a hospital by rescue workers.
There is no evidence of the reason for the night crossing of the young woman's track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustical perceptions.
Residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are in question.
Information about the cause of the accident can be given on the telephone 0800/6888000 or on any other police station at around the clock and free hotline of the federal police.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to address the dispute over the planned TTIP Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private conciliation bodies for disputes between groups and states are thus to be replaced by a more transparent system which is much more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," said the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedes have proposed to bring the proposal into free trade talks with the US as a European negotiating position.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU Member States and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to be from the EU, the US and third countries.
A second instance is foreseen for the first time.
It would allow an objection to be raised against judgment.
Up to now, the parties to the proceedings agreed between themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of opposing their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, according to her own information, she intends to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes could also be settled between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) demanded mainly by large groups are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
Traditional arbitrators are criticized by opponents as being a kind of parallel justice, with companies claiming damages to taxpayers, with outlawing national laws or withholding a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In its first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact considered the proposals of the European Commission to be inadequate.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Mr Sigmar Gabriel had drawn up in spring with other EU Trade Ministers.
The old system of private arbitrators was from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Europe Association warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules.
This could make small and medium-sized enterprises particularly disadvantaged, it was said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
A framework for the agreement should initially be in place at the end of this year.
This date is deemed to be no longer valid.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state Michigan with felt pin.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Steven's lecture.
He tells about different places he records on the map again and again, about which his minusive and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they came into existence and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative mistake.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear, which can harmoniously smear very close to the American folk of the late Sixties, but run into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor emerges that "Michigan" would be the first part of a dissenting series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near Rhine, "Seven Swans" has appeared and is breaking some expectations.
Reduced Stevens is acting here.
Live enough for him to play guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois") in 2005, there is a magnificent masterpiece.
Extensive of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any year best list of influential music media.
After highly productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic spare parts.
This sixth neat studio album is still wide orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Along the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of Neon-Starbands and a large fluorescent stage decor.
Sufjan Stevens currently tours Germany as part of a five-member band.
More in the dark Hamburger!
Theater he mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now exiled in their chairs, Stevens, who has become more mature, returns to intimacy and to the folk.
Without directing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The talk is "opulent" and you can throw away the "plate in essence".
Only to an addition does Stevens modestly thank himself, plays acoustically few older songs and eventually bows down under overwhelming applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is awaited with excitement at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour president, Jeremy Corbyn, is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and take the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, examining his performance from the media and the Labour Members from the vicinity.
He demanded "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, as it will come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour president to continue on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to itself
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said that he had "standed in respectful silence" and he had recognized the "Helterdom of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour president to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limits on winnings.
Mr. Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour presented changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pension minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President, David Cameron, since he has been Tory Chief, across the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will be left out of both "punishment" and conflict with restraints, and instead has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the floor, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "Kasperle-Theater", often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later, he admitted that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the verdict of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow parliamentarians, although critics have argued that she had become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Gessen in Joburg': Without a roof young people trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds are rising due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose on the basis of data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and made estimates of the date of the interest rate increase since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,55055 and was climbed to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20% jump after the takeover bid of Rivallen AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for Luxury Goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again showing growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said that he had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set his estimate for the company Rating on "sales".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are at risk of expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lipstick 21 years young, a handcuff with superchicken freshness.
The type with platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going through.
Like Wikitoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m., the Polin sits on the cold stone slabs of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose posters hang together in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much a day as her mother, Ewa, earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my wikitoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I fill her with a dream."
School duty?
Who's jogging?
The fans don't.
Neither does Bieber himself.
He's already taken care of.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the Superbowl he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company flushed many, many dollars on the beeber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the shop table, beeber also cashes.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you can stare at the window.
More than 100 million are said to have been exploited like this.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber was finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" at number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, is not the first to interest the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato-field idea
Potatoes or nuts?
It is both possible - and this is in the case of a potato bean, which was developed by Oldenburger Imbisbehör Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "Kartoffel instead of Donner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay placed potato and meat together on a spear.
The idea brought him a poster at a pegida demonstration with the inscription "Kartoffeln instead of Doner", which he happened to have seen on TV.
Since then, a grilled spoon has been turned in its shop, which is packed with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered with the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
So Alhay does not want to betray how much meat and how much potatoes the spear contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the people is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to fight Aldi seizures
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA files from an aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesalers Metcash has launched a ground integrity campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like ice manufacturers Simmo from Dunsborough, who distribute samples in IGA stores and shop owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of his defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment performs his annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA charging business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the East.
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after the opening of their first markets, Aldi will remove about five percent of the food market in these two countries and will remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million of revenues per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million profit before interest and tax, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a Melbourne business lunch that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenue from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies around 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operating debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and IGA retailers improve their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label food.
Metcash's Chief Executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and retail refurbishment programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior, according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight by the infamous struggle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, and Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a seizure destroyed a potential U.S. open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was successfully defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for the second place in single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against the UK.
"One thing I'm pretty mature about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little involved in the fight," Healy said.
He broke a fight when he lost a seizure in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break a fight out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too strict.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing area, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
"First, we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick made the rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the spotlight in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares distress, closes the border, stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to get illegally into the country. Everything with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man country and Serbian officials responded with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there for an unknown time.
But frustrations began.
When a police helicopter swooped over them, the migrants scolded "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian emergency police.
Some showed food and water from protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "inceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, at the end of next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU Member States would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sziejarto said that his country also planned the construction of a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were employed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a significant narrow link and entry point for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving economic refugees who are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 metre (13 feet) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security consultant for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others were already deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now under police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are speeding up the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos encircled the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressured a crowd to get in there.
Some 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead a two-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (increased by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the Presidential Office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is firm on which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won some profits.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moderates, but these advances have been reduced.
Their support to the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has fled, and she and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit lead among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections throughout the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with a few reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would be enthusiastically supporting it.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not.
If democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, bids are at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say bids were their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If you decide not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead rises in front of Sanders, from 20 points with bets in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this number has fallen by 78 percent last month.
Biding is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that considers it to be the most "chosen" has risen.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters mention questions about the eligibility of candidates.
Just like last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre-election elections is seen as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important features in the electors of their party's pre-elections.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best cut off with honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not agree with him.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term of office as Foreign Minister, most democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion was still deteriorating.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this remains a problem for them among registered voters: only 32 percent of them see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the voters do not think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of the voters around the country also view Trump as being unreputable and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good grades in the lead.
Biden, Carson and Bush are best cut off by the six tested candidates with honesty.
A majority consider Sanders to be more honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is located at the latest CBS News/New York Times survey close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half the support of voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatically
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country. Support is growing by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson arrived well in demographic groups and that Trump is outnumbered by Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen to the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 persons from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was performed in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the polls - he lands at 19 % support to Republicans, behind the Trump with 32 % support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
Looking at a carson rising last week, Trump found some sideways for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa.
Comfortable bath temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Although peaks are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for swimmers to find still warm water.
A bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some are no longer going to the sea: maximum 18 degrees of water in the North and Baltic Seas this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) announces.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: even up to 29 degrees east.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a harassing ritual of a student relationship in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murders are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Brothership brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police informed.
Officials said that he had been attacked with his eyes tied with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked as he tried to go over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 after Deng became incapacitated and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide Utensilien and basically presented the well-being of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with blunt force injuries to the head, buttocks and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died every year from the harassment," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in an explanation.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with malicious attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to make the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this – officially or unofficially – we will also draw these to account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
There will be an increase in interest rates, and the house will be shaken, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slip into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history for the economy offers little guidance for the process.
A recession occurred within only 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exacerbated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the US tines to normal heights, but still to a low level, to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based view of how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that wealth gains are suffocated 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed increases in interest rates.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increasing interest rates, rather flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, head of investment strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return starts to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Above all, it is remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed increases its interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, at 118 interest rates since 1950, only twice nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed data.
Increases in interest rates in such a fragile economic scene could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken up an interest rate increase of the Fed all year round, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the futures trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all rise cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing growth in GDP, and pre-recession heights have quickly shattered after the start of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far these are 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond endites immediately fall, said the Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds coming closer and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-in-come analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the outlook for more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flattened, credit spreads have increased and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed increases its strategy.
Largely, companies that carry out the larger part of their business in the US will benefit from interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar will cost their products on the global market and also finance their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to respond positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have, on average, exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the increases in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most," Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.

Colleague Damien Collins attacked the mission The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, claims a leading parliamentarian and increases new pressure on the station to prove that he is doing something that private stations do not do.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-law radio station "dumble" and increasingly no longer distinguishes itself from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be The British just under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the engagement of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I think it's also really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was necessary to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less aware of classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, however, which, during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, came under fire to kick the commercial rivals.
The Tory member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was "produced on special BC-wise".
He added that he wished that the company "found a hit from our own stable" when it next started a series of entertainments.
However, he refused to exclude the appointment of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased most slowly in August and the Black Friday can be responsible
In the first three months of 2015 there was a 7 percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since the start of the recording in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday has slowed the spending in November
For more than a decade virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August showed the lowest growth since the beginning of the recordings in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnant after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous year and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers started to do business with their cell phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may experience that growth is diminishing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for the decline in revenues.
Experts believe that buyers hold off their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bargains fell, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 issues, slightly more than £1 was spent online.
With some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca at a crane accident - Bin Laden's family is being sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are worn by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia is partially burdened by the huge Saudi bin-laden group
The Ministry of Health also said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mecca's big mosque.
Trawlings filled, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respect, when the first of the dead went on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-Friedhof.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then upon the beds.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi King imposed a penalty on 394 injured persons over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster.
The bodies of 29 betters who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the Hadjh will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management of travel abroad is prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman praised to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane that plunged into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hadjsch, which took place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Krans, and their representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also appealed to the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surround Mecca's Gross Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the Saudi Arabia family of rulers for decades and is taking on larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son, who was abducted from the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£ 174.000) be paid to the relatives of the murdered and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employed Craftsman, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased since then.
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home.
If you are able to deal with a hammer or brush to strike walls, today you seem to be a minority.
For Briten increasingly employs craftsmen to perform homework jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laurie, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who have now been offered low-cost services has been overtaken.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B&Q.
Mrs. Lauriy said she wants to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women in the store.
At the moment, the men are superior to the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single-households that do more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Lauriy said, "It's still working a majority of men in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of decisions about the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Lauriy, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also reorganized her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial director.
Mrs. Lauriy said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher mentioned a decrease in half-yearly profits and sales after the group trained the costs for closing shops.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officers of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants didn't confess guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been lost.
According to Supreme Attorney Robert Rifel, in the preliminary investigation, it was crystallized that the defendants used money from association accounts via which they were allowed to dispose in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage figures for me is about 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact led the president of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
In the face of the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had not at any time been an asset-disadvantage.
The sports officials had only calculated damage to expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, led to the debt – the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 shillings (r. 44.000 euros).
"At that time, we faced the situation: are we continuing or closing the club?" one of the defendants, in the bread business, told the chief accountant of the Treasury.
He then decided to take on this task with his colleague and fellow prosecutor.
With all the risks.
"We've put money in advance, put our life insurances in place as security at the bank," he said when he agreed.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, there can only be no debts made.
In addition, with the corresponding financial success, the payment of the compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991.
For this reason, some of the expenses incurred had not been paid out until years later, i.e. from 2003 when an increase had been paid in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed bookings appeared, the former Obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants jointly, said the second defendant.
Why the payouts had not been disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association did not have any interest in detail in the grant of the finance, so the answer was only that it was important to be free of debt.
When in 2011 started against the one official investigation for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
That would have been a lie, the defendants explained.
This security account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know any answer to that for a long time.
Finally, he said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The defendant had been informed, and the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage recovery".
Why damages?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant claimed that he did not agree to this wording because the association had never been harmed.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "You're all out of the tailor."
"Do I have a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the officer said that he had never received a cent salary, he had calculated only mileage money and diets.
At diets he charged the club 1,000 euros a month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years were not available to the defendants.
This was no longer retained after an operating test, in which everything had been assessed as correct, they explained.
Kilometer money had also received the second defendant.
All the corrections had been made in cash, and he had to drive from his residence to the bank to Bielurg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue with the questioning of witnesses on 23 September.
Hewlett-Packard Strikes Another 30,000 Jobs
In addition to the ongoing staff cut over the last three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The job cuts at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its business customer division.
As a result, costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) were to be saved, the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will attack from the fourth quarter.
The current reduction of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP employed some 302,000 people.
The Hewlett Packard share remained post-market 2.3 percent.
The group of printers from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: this is how the computer and printing business is to be bundled into a new society even this year - apart from the more future-oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and the other services.
Both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales, as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, have recently increased the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter to the end of July, PC and printer sales decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8% to just under $25.4 billion.
Thus, the proceeds decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only recently responded to the fact that customers are strengthening smartphones and tablets instead of buying traditional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans in total foresee the dismantling of some 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority supports the anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would, however, be overwhelmingly repugnant: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air raids against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
Twenty-four percent oppose intervention in the conflict.
A cooperation with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, and would be 20 percent of them.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day at 66th IAA
The exhibition focuses on connected, self-propelled cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday on.
The organisers of the VDA car association expect about 900,000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police deployed hundreds of refugees at the Serbian border at Röszke Trenengas and water sheds.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border inspection point.
It reported by telephone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the police was a water-thrower ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks, and plastic bottles at the officers.
Officials used pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now retreated unexpectedly.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees sank together and suffered under breathlessness.
The press spokesmen of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
The world watches when the US bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates have been raised for the first time since almost a decade.
A survey among 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which was still in the view last week that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will continue a little longer and the interest rates will hold at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed interest rates were set on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero zone and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance level, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a slight inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. on Thursday
Death Protectors at Delta State University Left Letters of Apologize
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his co-workers on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "suffering" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it rude," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency call number at 10:00 on Monday morning
and said he shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center staff that the police had to send the police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb", but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, which said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday that the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "driving relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "brought to the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter's "absolute best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate in spring 2015 from Delta State University, as his lifelau stated on the University's website.
Stars that have lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor was also said to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession.
I'm sure all of this will require his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's around 1000 executives will cost the job.
There are new negotiations with the pilot trade union.
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evaluating the low-end Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment was to make a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and redemption synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
In the future, Lufthansa will no longer have a board for passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost flight line was to be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the board team headed by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the realignment, Sphohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines were established under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the conflict of tariffs with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), negotiations will resume after the judicial strike on this Thursday.
The union told me that.
The theme of the talks is the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wanted to produce sustainable results as soon as possible "in one year with a forecasted record result".
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the background concept is Wings.
It foresees that Lufthansa will outsource routes to Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at Manchester's Champions League defeat at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left defender to the wine and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double bone fracture and he's in the hospital."
He is transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an eleven-meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an eleven-meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
This is where Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the defenseman of England has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel very bad, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents will learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fable published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have missed so far."
Everything beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's action, instead reproduces a content statement of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amidst the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey to the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss' hostage and who died in 1991, but was completely unknown.
As if this were not yet suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey to the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the work of the book. Here hears an unnamed boy, as the local environment falls by the money-loving, trees, thneed-stripping once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a shocking, beauticating being, "that speaks in the name of the trees," is destroyed.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper, who The Lorax did not read a child 20 times in a row.
A downing street speaker said that the text had probably come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not provide any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by England's team exclusion, but it's still hard.
Coming to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the frame that England has chosen for the tour, there is no repetition of the 3-0 series defeat on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an off-road win.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear 2012 scars, only a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as spin-bowler and adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Message related to this: Adam Lyth withdraws from the England Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is, of course, difficult for me to analyze as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and this led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best voters.
A long time ago, one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.
I hope that if he pulls out more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and abroad.
The only accusation you can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in supreme form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a hit man I value very much.
He is an X-factor cricket player, whom we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same chances as before, but this, of course, depends on the teaming in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen hit next to Cook, what an extra spin-bowler would do and get four Quicks showed up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hit man can't hit there, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's a devil's wretch of Cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he became an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up spider, and in my limited dealings with him he has very impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a dot, but there are no large numbers of backup spins that raise their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test game consultant, could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played against all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room, even if the news is in harmony with the previous one.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in service at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia, and for my part I have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team directors do not set the timetable.
And you have to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy is on the run until 2017
David Cameron's unexplained renegotiation strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU is becoming more difficult every day, even without the choice of ingenious Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as leader of Labour or the TUC, who is fiercely disputing about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now, and not always because of their own guilt, the UK's own agenda is filled with split concessions and disruptive Treaty changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like to do so if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photograph of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes to see Britain looking outside inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's carefully minded chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened to the exaggerated long endurance like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a dazzling force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will break out of a leg to help the selfies whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something that they do not want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, quite in the SNP style, while the UK referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a crime" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can remember Boris Johnson, the ore Euro-opportunist, who has made a name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better spread bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, miliband was more Blairisher than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum vortex, because Blair had set the principle of the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening up a back door to him.
The press never gave him that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he needed no more time to waste for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake back then and today.
It may take, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-colored tendency and the wilder lilies of Tory's Little-Englandism can say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Benn" Benn on the radio and on television this week when the pathfinder fought in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour-Kabinett colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and MPs after all the reports at her session on Monday evening.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the strudel of social media, a breeding site of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe, which allows him to think Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a self-evidentness, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their spirit of siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not start a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have distrustful voters - in order to make concessions to the British, if that can be pointless?
The USA is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of Tory's government in power, which I was reminded on Monday of what British Influence Security Forum called itself.
Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
According to a government-funded agency, e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arising from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who wrote in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "base rate report" last month and describes it as a "overall review of evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed verification of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called up to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (multi-criteria decision analysis - MCDA) to produce a synthesis of their opinions on the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health whose Managing Director was supposed to have received from British American Tobacco Mittel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the panel are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate an industry finance in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
PHE's tobacco leadership also took part in the meeting.
McKee and Capewell wrote the research work of the group "significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria".
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there has been no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been responded to.
He said, "E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every other lifelong smoker dies in his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a smoking illness, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Chief of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in hard-controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of transmitters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 for no success in his time.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcasting, which would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus-Communications-committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least place your production on programs that others don't make or commission.
You are sending The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve as broad a support as possible for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax programme could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of hunting according to ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience quite, but they do their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
At the broadcasting fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions that can be best appreciated.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, I wonder if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky- and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, form and entertain".
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on radio - and she should take an example of this change in "informing, clarifying and entertaining" on the public-law television channels in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the proms he said only a handful will be shown on television, and enter with the commercial channels alliances in order to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the Nematods change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematods change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells, which are genetically altered to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More information on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Srekanth Chalasani, researcher at Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplified the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematods, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
If it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblasts and transmitted to the worms, where they switch on the modified motoneurons.
The process has several similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with the impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down to the desired place on an optical fiber in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic tissues can happen unimpeded and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads shame Britain’s arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Trade Show Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Pedestrian leg restraints!
Strapbomb!
And electric shock rods that cause agonizing pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms trade fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the British government's readiness to unleash arms to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you driving with DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with the DLR ... customers are asked to help at the stop of the gun fair.
The 300 posters are presented by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbus keys, which claims that "access to around a third of bus stop areas on the planet will get access."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements, noting that they have to go outside to the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-gun trade posters is greeted by the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms trade fair - through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic silent corporate advertising, but "by blazing with bright colors and animation it remains more solid."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about selling illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a step by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be dealt with illegally in front of our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors scorch fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgetting 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still in the belief in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move into student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honourfully don't love or hate Marmite, because in serious, boys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show you interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers.
Let people go.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, film-night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and put their underwear on.
Related to this: Don't think about starting at the university with a relationship
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-space bumblebee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I've spent on interacting with you."
Try to feel when a comelitone of bliss is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that a non-closed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back-many, knocking at the doors of people is to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies, less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to close friendships.
Your fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and may at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you knock on.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course the clawing of chickens is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It is not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the saying, you are one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they had anything to do with quieting Drum & Bass, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she had her own music stained, closed her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student residence?
On the other hand, it wouldn't be a gruesome shame if you were to hold a roommate for your future wife, get involved with her, split up again and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she transfers all of her friends to her?
Of course, the heart is going its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future wife, at least try to talk a little sense into your lower womb.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between a wolf and bullying is more fine than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Through hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but never pollute anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and place your keys in a glass of water, which will put you in the freezer - but don't tackle your property on the ceiling more than twice.
Houses for refugees, single-parents, low-valuers
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds house for people who don't have much money in the central Franconian corner valley.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need living space, but also the only parent mother and the low-earner."
"I show you how to build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will press the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how to create cheap housing quickly: he builds houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will press the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing in the next decades.
A completely balal, three-storey rowhouse is the solution.
Gildner: A rowhouse needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you house people in blocks of residence.
Each of the six houses being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
How much are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have successfully completed my project.
Especially complicated is the threatening Damoklesschlagt special building and the pitch regulation.
Cruel.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a row of houses needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is the space missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their rowhouse project?
Gildner: There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you exacerbate the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True, we have had a tree in Germany for the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, also the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-earner.
I'll show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first studied environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing to "general" and then selecting "software update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that indicates that the "software update has failed".
In order to deal with the problem, users are recommended to either wait until the storm goes back or try to update over iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by dredging the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool, delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone might turn off half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
Before the start, the second World Cup emphasized in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday of champion and double champion Hamilton.
The Briton won seven of the previous twelve seasons and also launches the Flutlicht-Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have influence on Singapore's Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days a dark bell hangs over the city, triggered by fire on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
Founded three months ago, the chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing membership to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess player and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the wearer of the first class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation, which President Alfred Klein received.
This makes it possible to include chess players who are unable to apply the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes to see membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the "Rot-Weiß" tennis club as an expression of his association with the spa town.
Quartiersbüro is looking for direct contact
Saludis and Antonistift Altenzentrum have joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stuffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, to the count steuffenberg square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and advice-seekers will immediately receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or health insurance services.
For years, we have observed with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Not many of the cashier's benefits are also rarely used because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new landlord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antoni Foundation and the citizens' hospital as well as for the "Amadeus" outpatient service.
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The saludis was taken into the boat for this purpose.
Therefore, additional offers such as crash prevention, memory training or physiotherapy can be used.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre", said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is the demographic change of the two directors.
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the opening ceremony, the Quartiersbüro also devoted itself to the association of the elderly: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular social gathering".
This makes the social foundation a major contribution that senior citizens can live as independently and well in their familiar surroundings.
The Quartiersbüro is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the date for the FC Eintracht Bamberg game against the third-party player Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set for renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was now set as an appointment.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football totopokals against the third-party FC Würzburger Kicker was now finalized.
It will be played at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion on Tuesday, 6 October at 19 a.m.
"We are glad that we now know when the game goes over the stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now started pre-sale of cards.
It's special for our team to play against a third party player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlights have a special appeal.
In 2010 FC Eintracht Bamberg won the first FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional leaguer 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB club's 2016/2017 season.
Title Defender is Third League Champions SpVgg Unterhaching.
Wiener Architekt Karl Mang died 92-year-old
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and head of institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the Austrian Theatermuseum with the establishment of the Schatzkammer in the Wiener Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz.
Park Penalty: Tim Wiese recruits a policeman with money
Tim Wiese, an ex-footballer in Bremen.
Soccer was once, Tim Wiese, ex-national gatekeeper in Germany and in Bremen and Hoffenheim is now involved, Wrestler.
He wants to add 30 kilograms of muscle mass according to his own statement over the past two years.
Intellectually, he did not add.
Wiese was able to cut his hair in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking space guard issuing a billboard for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the wife and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "picture" magazine reports.
The blame is confirmed in the city of Bremen, but the consequences for the unusual incident are still unclear.
"The matter is still under review," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not meadow is displayed.
Panaman authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest typical climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for growing marijuana plants.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have been plucking out 4500 plants and burning them.
Men bang on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23.45, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghanan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres, according to police reports, and called them to be allowed to wait for him.
At that time, the group was located at the level of the Bft office.
On the premises of the gas station, three people also stopped.
One of these men yelled at the young, and struck the young man with the fist in his face.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and bled strongly out of the nose.
When his two friends rushed down and spoke apprehensively to the striker, he initially abandoned his victim.
His friends now brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and protestively passed there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was once again attacked by the baton and another male person.
With the help of a bat, the victim’s face and thighs were sprayed.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of perpetrators.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second striker should have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and advisers to sign up under the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also welcomed by the mayor of Samtgemeindemeister Bernd Bormann, economics sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf on the other hand has luck: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be on his side with half of his successor in the coming months.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests EUR 310000 in the premises on St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongol, who are currently studying in the Verdenen hospital and who wants to join the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The Muller couple liked the idea of operating their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years".
As an advantage, he also sees himself soon to be his own boss.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-time father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical study in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and was also appointed as a senior medical officer in the Diepholz district in 2009 and is volunteering in the DRK readiness of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialises in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as house doctors.
"This is why endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongol.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need one more speech room.
Furthermore, the EDV is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of EUR 50000 under a support programme from the district (25000 euros) and from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," says Samtgemeindemeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, about 2,000 patients enter the Felstehausen practice every quarter, with an average North German practice of about 500.
In Asendorf there is another hospital practice.
A positive side-effect of the practice taken over by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller's hour of speech continues to look in familiar faces: takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their departure an era ends in Asendorf, at least the doctors have practised there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms", Ursel Felstehausen remembers smiling.
She feels a little pain after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Your husband adds, laughing: "We have a 6000-square-meter base."
"I've always pressed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also going up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border will remain in place at the same time.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum could also do so "of course".
The supply and security of people is at the forefront.
But of course, "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia Considered "Corridor" - Slovenia Refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow refugees to return to Austria and Germany and may also set up corridors for refugees.
However, this was not seen by the Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar, in Liège.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", rather Slovenia would intensify border monitoring - especially for Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia was already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
However, as the Minister pointed out, Slovenin does not want to lock his borders on refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried Tuesday in the hours of the night to enter East Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been operating in Croatian Tovarnik ever since.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the next few days his country will have about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
However, the Belgrade government argues that it is to instruct people to take certain routes: "We can neither, nor will we do so," it said.
According to the media reports, at least a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early morning, while further buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue their journey through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route of Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary-Hungary which has already been predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Extensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia had "wide-ranging possibilities for border control" as a non-Schengen member.
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007, the EU partners have since issued a good witness to the country as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgos crossing that leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to move on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on a local eye in Horgos on Wednesday morning: he held the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very high refugee figure at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Help advice to migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not a matter of concern: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still open mines.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearances had been sent to the border region.
Exchange Hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have heard of a ring of cybercriminals that has been accused of having repeatedly provided insights into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected should have provided insider business in the financial markets.
According to the investigators, this was the result of a total of over 100 million dollars.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the USA and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizhilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Right around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz reigns in operation.
The people do their errands, sometimes fast steps, partially dimmering.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
Urban railways are holding.
Pulsating, brilliant life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large tablets each with the headline "Before I Want to Die"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is also available to passersby for questions and discussions as well as the volunteer staff.
While some passersby takes spontaneously to the chalk and adds the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "run with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "not suffer for long", others stay short, read, say phrases like "I'm not that far yet" and then go on.
Again and again, small discussions on the action itself, on life, on how to deal with dying develop at the margins.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end will come for me at some point in this world can I live responsibly," says the director of the deaconic work Mannheim, who is together with the Caritas association bearer of the ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this public action should be good for the 20-year-old.
It is understandable, however, that not everyone on the boards wants to communicate in public, and finally it is a very personal matter.
The theme of death and death remains taboo, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although in recent years the hospice movement has contributed a lot to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and grief attendant is one of the honorary employees of the first hour.
Through personal experience faced with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice sought honorary assistance by phone, she immediately reported herself and was present at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary - 43 women and two men - accompanied the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They've all been carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with their task and the experiences and experiences they have gained.
"I see the life of another wait, think it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice service is free and non-confessional.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and the donation of family members and associations enables training and further training and supervision of the death and grief attendants.
Every two years, training is offered to new employees.
The tablets described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be listed on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook decreased for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected according to a survey of FactSet $10.84.
The lower outlook comes despite the rise in prices, which averages 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher increases in ground transport of heavy and large packages collected from November onwards.
The company said that it still expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "produces solid revenues if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday employment plans were announced one day later than the Rival UPS, which plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind $2.44 per share, predicting twelve analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zack's surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which led to stagnating sales in its Express shipping unit.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, soil transport sales increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $15.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strateg spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it is time to raise the lead rate for the first time for almost a decade.
At one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room there is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
The central bank has a twofold mandate from Congress: maximising US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be defused from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that they grow solid, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate on federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation will obviously be the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus as to what the Fed will do, which in itself is insuring the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decrease in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists reduce the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed Policy will maintain the sentence this week," said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at this time," he said.
If she does, "they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on a good path to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be required, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed considers to be a full-time job.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was consistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month after China had downvalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average was more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would threaten global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May peak.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulences influence the complex calculation when you want to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be reckless at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. bank.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get better control of the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the Fed, therefore it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the final effect, the Fed Monetary Authority of the world has become.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "link" their monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite the limited noticeable impact on growth in the US", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest-fixing committee.
The recent turbulence is not near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are exhilarating," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should advance the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market, which is also sold to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/store is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to walk through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and affordable) in this store is close to the checkouts and has various inclusion options.
What there is here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
It's probably LAX-C.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry on request for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and bile, pig-natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthly Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
Making you warm welcome is not going without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 lentils she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Straße.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a proper school.
Brazil’s Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying in a shocking way to inform women of the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipality council, Bernried, approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattened for solar system.
Plans for long-awaited gymnastics construction at the Bernrieder Sportgelänge will move forward step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the proposal for construction was unanimously honoured without major discussions.
Previously, the panel had, among other things, decided on an application for a "exception" or "liberation" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding roof construction.
Thus, a "satellite roof with non-moderate first and roof resistance" is to be built.
The planning background is the intended use of the roof space for solar systems: "This brings together a wonderfully large south roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In turn, the "liberation" was about the roof inclination, which should be less than ten degrees for energy reasons, unlike the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" in relation to the roof inclination - whereas the Berned City Council is usually more restrictive in the case of requests for exemption.
Turnhallenbau, however, is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent for this," says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project of the community and SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are calculated at cost.
Grants are expected from school and latitude promotion.
In the next step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted for examination to the Landratamt.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
Peissenberg Hospital is due to close earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peissenberg to Schongau.
These are the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH of the County Council, which Andrea Jochner-Weiss confirmed.
A decision on this, however, is taken by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will take place next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all the nearly 50 employees at the Peissenberg Hospital would continue to work.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with fishermen and the further existing inner station.
The rooms were present.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who cannot join us after Schongau are supposed to be offered a job in Weilheim.
The employees were informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only since the beginning of the year as medical director of the Schongau clinic and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "fisher" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau this means in any case a "upgrading" and a spread of the offer in the field of "Inner Medicine", says Jochner-White.
Fisherman is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases on the inner station.
For the next two years, fishermen with their team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses until the next year, the former Hospital of Charity, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the Weilheim hospital was completed.
Land Councilwoman Jochner-White, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, faced rumors that the house owned by the federal election will in future be used as accommodation for asylum-seekers.
As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," said Fischer about the Quasi move to the Lech, who had been "positive and very understanding" received by the employees.
There has been no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongau's colleagues to take over the position of the Doctor's Director.
The Peissenberg Hospital (some 100 beds) has been threatened by closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballs of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are demanded at the Bergische HC tonight (20.15 hrs).
The Bundesliga table leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for superiority.
In the past season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting dunfall with two injured at Pratau
Two tractors have been severely injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Aberntens on a Maisfeld near Pratau (Kreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals.
At first, how exactly it could be the accident was unclear.
Criminal police have been investigated.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Crime
One suspect has led the police to the corpse of 16-year-olds who have been missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young people and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as the prosecutors and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday evening is considered suspect and the investigators led to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the case of questions in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a suspicion against the 20-year-olds.
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the arrest, the authorities admitted in the police interrogation to have killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the jailer on Wednesday, and the investigators are to blame him for his death.
Further investigations are to be carried out on the nearer circumstances of the act.
Refugees Need Accommodations: Study Warns About Housing Vulnerability
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long started.
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
To meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 each year.
This results in a study commissioned by the Association of Sozialer Wochenbau.
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
There are 140,000 apartments missing.
After the first three months of her stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then encounter the housing market and line up in the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study has also been a major failure in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 residential units were missing in the convalescent areas, lamented Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in emergency situations in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed in "Hotel Mama" for a long time because of the flaut on the apartment market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per head has decreased for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing Building" proposes a reboot.
New incentives for social housing should be relaunched.
In this way, the land tax could be waived and the land tax suspended for a limited period of time for funded dwellings.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation at the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start was already reached on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be upgraded.
Refugees have free leadership: Croatia and Slovenia establish corridors
After Hungary is practically no longer a passover, as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant transit via Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Minister of Interior, and if necessary we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Minister of Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken into Croatia to enter Western Europe.
500 people had crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports Croatian TV channel RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, make the ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said, "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on Serbia's border with the EU-Nachbarland Croatia.
According to most media reports from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to cross the green border on foot to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
There are other dangers to the border strips: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine clearances are now expected to create a secure passage quickly.
After the border is closed, however, there are hardly any refugees in Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 arrested people.
It had been 9380 shortly before the gate closing on Monday.
The new Hungarian laws imposed the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the Szeged border city of southern Hungary.
The condemned threatened imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transitzons" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - were the most important transition in Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees had stopped there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers started cleaning it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in the past few weeks.
Locking grids were dismantled and one of the recording warehouses in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak out for the purpose of this conversion.
Austria, after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees arrive.
The country has also reinforced its border controls.
However, around 20,000 migrants remained in the country after government declarations.
In Salzburg some 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train from there to Germany was stopped on the morning at the direction of German authorities.
Minor groups of refugees regularly entered on foot in release.
Mayors crossed the border with "Beached"
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people were carrying suitcases at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau by train.
However, because Germany had stopped rail traffic with Austria surprisingly on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was in Wernstein's end for her," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau.
Before that, we once tasted the unexpected guests with jause and drinks.
We just said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was natural for us," says Stadler in the OÖN-Talk.
You were very grateful.
A man could not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"That's very pleased with us," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening the stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was stopped before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday social, day before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is sending us thousands of more Zig thousands now is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the camp Röszke in the construction of structures to guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has made the position of the Hungarian government highly official and publicly in the dark circle of National Socialism.
Unfortunately, this policy is not only for those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "promised country", which they invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for people seeking protection in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-resistant quarters
Konrad has all his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the initial reception center of Traiskirchen has already got hold of Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
Also the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great vortex, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "critical situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the figure, there will still have to be 35,000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the Federal Republic of Germany.
Should there be more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the heads of state.
These would have assured him that they would also create quarters for the future refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-mandate supports Konrad.
Tomorrow, there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be that quarters have to hold a certain height of towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, "use standards" would have to apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad's experience is based on the fact that he is more successful at accommodation.
I am an older gentleman, to whom the falsehood is plainly said in the face.
Convinced was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause costs as they declared themselves.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Our own search for quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up an office container at Stephansplatz.
But apparently there are problems with the permission.
Linz calls for a better division
For now, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for the Accommodation of Refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, since people affected can be accommodated without these measures at present, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in the event of an emergency, further sites are to be tested for their suitability.
The city chief is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also contribute here.
Seehofer: "Margins are not locked"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday on the further action in the refugee question.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked down.
Moving on to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, there are just the border controls in this respect.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available for the time being.
However, protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is also reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The General Refurbishment of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has been moved in, the rest (2700 square metres) is to be rented to young innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Shipyard and later acquiring some.
From the beginning S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building is leased to S&T and Techcenter by Linz AG for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters remaining in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent give it requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened second business in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to lay down a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade had to postpone this project in a short time: finally, she has grown in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the store where they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything is now turned around women's handbags from Furla, purses from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Several weeks earlier, it was rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking about opening a store for a long time," says Breit.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also employed from the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in large Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves.
Your fashion interest has got Breit put from her mother into the cradle.
I'm most effective when something develops and I can show new trends at tangible prices.
Why some women are wearing a beautiful handbag when looking at a beautiful handbag, the expert woman cannot answer with the utmost certainty.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit.
The Rulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called governors.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to be the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for inciters.
Whether it is xenophobic, journalism is rife or knowledge gaps are revealed in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presidential Office is strongly intriguing the election campaign.
And cut off well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate Kaldstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the Weinstraße.
Some people in the 1200-dwelling place are more than ten corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
Simone Wendel, the caller, shot a film about Trump.
And what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprinklers, including the Ketchup family Heinz, in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would surely also succeed if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tending to think that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
The nickname of Kallstadt in the vicinity, "Die Brolljesmacher", is by chance to Hochdeutsch, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the giver.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold graves in the United States.
The property group's foundation was the first property purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return permanently to their homeland failed at the Bavarian state, to which the Pfalz belonged at that time.
He had not recorded Trump because he had once left without permission, had declared the director of the Institute of Pälzische Geschichte und Volkskunde, Roland Paul, to be a film starter.
Trump was the grandson of an "illegal emigrator".
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Like the polterate, this is not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The Grandma was a born Trump, the grandfather was born of Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so uplifting".
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He's never taken care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church angel during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine Donald doing that," says the 68-year-old.
She felt better if he did not like the election, because "he has such radical views, I do not know if that is good".
If those who had spoken at the time of their grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there at all".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes are ripe even without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, saw 12,000 cinematographers, and also in the USA aroused interest.
The Upper Bavaria municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
From the hands of the vice president at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfeng, the 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 mountaineering villages in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" shall have a population of not more than 2500.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made any major shifts in the reviews for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's fall.
The Rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase in ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today reached an average of 318,000 in August compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Until September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers on today's market.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning people more than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily hit The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17.00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, showed an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour it was 77,000.
Hot-seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the rates of the second evening of The Chase Australia will confidently agree that hot-seat will finally come through at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that failed to skip the McGuire show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret Revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed at Sam Wood's in The Bachelor's, was covered in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavon's fellows on the day before going out of three two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have been lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should get Wood's last Rose?", their answers could become the spoiler, who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood except themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought this throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is standing on earth with both feet, it is so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw her together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
From her point of view Mackay said that last week's house visit made it clear that Wood could be "one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set on him unconditionally," she said.
And when she was asked who should choose Wood, if not she, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on ten on Wednesday, 19:30.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a Geranggel as much as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit did at his first point return on Tuesday on 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a point and also to the current game after an injury from Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patched catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patzt at a point restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a Try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roll field with weapons force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and suppressed his democratic efforts.
Free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Head of Party and Group Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Autumn Clause in Großwallstadt about a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will have misrepresentations in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtag fraction of the Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
In fact, other main themes were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overtake Klausur," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslav war in the 1990s.
"This is not the way forward, we have to deal with the causes," said the President-in-Office.
Rejected asylum seekers want to move free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW Chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards across Germany."
"Bayers drift, others don't."
"We need to become more capable of action."
However, national policy in Greater Wallstadt should not fall under the table.
A permanent burner for years remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) launched the pilot test "Medium Level plus" in 47 high school schools, which will test an extension of the upper secondary school from three to four years - as a result it will take nine years to graduate.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The theme G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all the high schools who want to.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Harder Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market has closed down with profits following an over-long course of pointless and nervous trading.
Only in the afternoon did a firm start of the U.S. stock exchanges provide a clear direction that ultimately transported the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points upwards.
The MDax averaged 0.54 percent to 19 552,88 points.

The EuroStoxx 50 as the main index of the Eurozone advanced by 1.01 percent to 3207,60 points.
Solid profits also accounted for the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the United States, the Dow Jones index last recorded about 1 percent in the plus.
Many stock exchanges expect markets to take place this Friday until after the interest rate decision in the US and also to the great downfall on the stock exchange.
In the meantime, the discussion about the burdens of the nuclear exit has pushed the shares of RWE to a record depth and left deep traces in Eon.
According to "Mirror", German energy companies may lack EUR 30 billion of provisions.
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but eventually lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to one dealer, a positive report of the US investor magazine "Barron's" followed from the weekend.
According to this, investors paid too little attention to the German chip builder.
Investments in forward-looking wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were dropped again than in the same period of the previous year, as the industry association Acea announced for the start of the IAA International Automobile Exhibition in Frankfurt.
The papers of Daimler and BMW autobuilders increased by 1.34 per cent or 2.21 per cent.
Volkswagen benefits were degrading by 1.26 percent.

The dollar thus cost EUR 0.8846 (0.8875).
4 people killed after police shot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head district official, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before she took advantage of rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The fight was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since the 10th century.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area.
Planned is a mix of trade, trade and housing - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post Youth Centre.
The preparations are currently in progress.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
They are waiting for corresponding offers, says it on the side of the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
No contracts had yet been concluded accordingly.
The city of Emden had bought part of the property located on the Ringstraße / Corner Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home at Emden's Small Sea take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
A number of entrepreneurs are still worried - they are afraid of selling out their recreational refugium
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, frowned upon, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home by the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized company Emder "System-Bau", made its plans publicly available for the first time on Monday evening at the Urban Development Committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had appeared on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went to the offensive from the system building management: "We don't have an answer to all the questions yet," he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among seabud owners who had come to the meeting highlighted the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, Seabuden owner and board member at the Anlieger's representation of interests, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant monastery that overlooks all the other buildings".
He also fears, like some other project critics, that the traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant: "There must be whole bus charges to make it count," says Schulz.
What is happening exactly on the well acre area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the building plans were also variable.
Twins young at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to meet its young Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian has brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twins are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian keeps her body closely up until now.
First the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center predicted on Tuesday a broad low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical whirlwind in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, such as in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical whirlwind in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts the Double Donation Campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, fleeing from war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager give the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family desperately seek help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on google.com/refugee relief.
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven out more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, torn by war.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for mildly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss are living longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been shown to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% resolved the disease completely and 28% in part.
In the medically-treated group, the complete resolution of diabetes was only one percent and partly only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gastritomie group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and showed a rather complete overcoming of the diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29% less likely to die over 15 years in obese people undergoing obesity surgery - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit in survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because she says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they gather these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsrück
It is a subject that is becoming increasingly prominent in Belletrics: a young woman, at school hours unloved and unresponsive, meets after years the swarm of her youth, and this one falls in love with her.
So also in the novel "Actually, we're not like this" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, as he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The chief professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she could set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents in the present circumstances.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised the efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Looking after several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and showed that the US's violent reaction drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he committed violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavy alcohol hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfection in children under the age of 12 reported to the poison control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going into the emergency room," Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a sample of courage in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwater to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially in young children, a few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call centre at the University of Kansas Hospital, the Fox 4 station in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in reach of children, and when children get there, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four syringes from hand disinfectants that smelled after strawberry in school, was put in an emergency room.
Her blood alcohol concentration was two times higher than the threshold legally considered to be drunk in an adult in 179, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah left her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain-trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and ransacked her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Healthcare professionals suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was labelled as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York City planned to poison their "common" teacher by posting antibacterial products around the classroom," says a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and exiled her from her room.
The police considered the vanquished plan to be "swiss" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In the event of an accident, a 33-year-old driver was easily injured on the cross section between Nordring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving on the roundabout towards the roundabout industrial area and was too late to notice that two leading vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he ran into an Audi's rear with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fiesta standing before it.
In the case of vehicles involved in the accident, damage was caused by approximately 10 000 euros, the police informed.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed off.
Rumours: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays the talk of disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn it back again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be careful with January-Neuve commitments that could destroy the cadre's unity
Dons increase guide over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half of the year gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about disharmonie down
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected. This one insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show any more highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here don't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
You talk about both teams, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it is not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against Aberdeen was followed by 10 men, who are now standing clear at the top of the table with five points leading.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Being together now is so important.
Warburton carefully for January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was referring to some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new accesses and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
Brentford's ex-chief said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea storms Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract expires at the Swans.
For two years, the 29-year-old has been struggling with a nasty ankle and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks with what he said and insists: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The immeasurable hibee was justified after he agreed to sing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the area of Roseburn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormman and added: "It is certain that I will not return to Tynecastle if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board of directors still have confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline on the playing field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back to work," said Donnelly.
McInne's happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to struggle desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them an advantage of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's elevenmeter in the first half-time.
McInnes said, "There is no team that won everything, in cup games or leagues that didn't even win games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that of the UK of 5.5 per cent, as showed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drinks disrupted the process
Since the security staff could not get the location, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the sturgeons into custody.
A breath alcohol test resulted in a 0.89 per million 16-year-old.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per million and remained in custody at first.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in the case of a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a viewer gallery in the Death Chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was first made in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So, why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the US, and since more applications are often available as places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to 5.
Whoever is selected, he will observe it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining about her.
She admitted that she could "have formulated it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.
But I think there's a strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn for it.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after humid police chased to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "seek him gently to return to the shore."
Canning Vale's police were called on Tuesday to a break-in house in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I won't come out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop is negotiating".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car to the graves to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired by the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt top test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had been holding back for 18 months because of the espionage accusations and didn't want it to "be like too high hanging grapes."
"I didn't intend to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable.
" Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I'm going to name when I'm asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they failed to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, was aware of this at the time and are still there today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's gonna be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people outside think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now makes them think about it.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I'm gonna put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the trainer have been built up with the long-lasting Cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he "can throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the racing day treatment rule "stupid", after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has wrongly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was like that on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the race day package. An investigation of this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here one has gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driver's flight
The police arrested a man after a crash with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram on weekends.
The cyclist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries with the helicopter after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia, the police stationed in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged with driver's flight and for failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He's in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy beats up rivals for claims to ring fights
Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy has labeled critique at the tackling of his players as "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's Trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm win at the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly veiled remark to the Storm team after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team was confident in his vote, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"This comes up again and again - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about ringing when they beat us in 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defensive system or techniques all year long, but over the past six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend turn.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. Therefore, he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is already strange how this appears again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "tangling football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long-time" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of a shitload of it.
But now he has a team that can play and we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like these.
I build more trust because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16:12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks made and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the AAMI Park pre-final. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbs with $200,000 deposit after drug charges
A man who may be threatened with a lifelong punishment because of his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life-long penalty for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a security deposit of $200,000 to reach his release.
"After reading the oath-making statements of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police every day and holds a curfew of 18:00-6:00.
Accident at A5 near Karlsruhe: Guidehouse tears apart
In the event of an accident involving three trucks on the 5 motorway at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment, as the police told him.
The cab of the accident generator is completely disintegrating.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 hours.
A damage of 122,000 euros was caused.
Stevan Hogg used girl phone to lure pedophile to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "concerning" web searches that used terms for searching for inappropriate pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it, because it would lead to "paedophile on the Internet" and then he "forgave to be a cop to scare them."
U.S. Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he is addicted to terrorizing people.
He admitted that the searches on his computer were carried out, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare the pedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared herself guilty in the sense of the bill of appeal to have recorded indecent images of children on June 14 last year, to have violated the conditions on January 25 this year and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" is to be found in his actions.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted bail, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was added to the directory of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Schleuser deviated on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being arrested on the German-Austrian border outside the major control points.
Many locks were left out of fear of discovery and arrest the people increased on smaller border crossings
On the Austrian side out, said a spokesman of the federal police.
Since Tuesday, more than 1000 refugees have been arrested in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn, along the Inn borderline.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There, they are received by federal police and forwarded to registration.
According to federal police reports, more refugees met again at the Munich Hauptbahnhof in comparison with the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8.00 p.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Founders of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of Sturmbö in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced hot sea air flows into the country.
The strong low was the outlet of the tropical storm "Henry", which had been pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday spring is also expected in the Black Forest, on the Schwäbische Alb and in the Bodenseekreis with buoys from 60 to 90 km/h.
On Friday the sun can then be seen again.
The mass does it: Every two years the car builders on the IAA show their newties.
2015 is mainly movement with compact cars, which currently sell particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: around 28.1 percent of new registrations were made available to this segment in August alone, according to the motor vehicle Federal Office (KBA).
This is also reflected on the IAA (Publikumstage 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel represents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in view, starting at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
The Hessen also offers other diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including for the first time three-cylinder gasoline.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel Astra first only as five doors.
As a second variant will follow the Kombi in spring, which is already on the IAA.
And next to the Astra on the IAA, what are new compact cars going up?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five door in a conventional and a sporty GT version.
In the beginning of next year, he comes into trade, then also as a combination.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is a completely new segment.
The Nissan branch wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model.
The compact infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The base model will have a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer's specifications.
The launch of the sale of Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-deleger placed above all hand at the front: Here, the cooler grille was repainted and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and integrated for the first time Apple's CarPlay.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are joined at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of humans
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-prisoner of the Tegel Registry, who was housed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, even if they were confined to too narrow rooms for a few days, they could hope for money (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This led to the success of an ex-Häftling with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel Judiciary Institute between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated.
After that, the man, who had now been relocated to a larger cell, according to his lawyer’s report, was on the loose again.
Although his plea of arrest failed because of the unworthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin.
However, the Constitutional Judges raised the judgment of the Board of Appeal in Berlin and referred the case back to it for review.
You see the man's human dignity injured.
The Board of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days from the period in question were to be liable for compensation, a compensation claim was made.
Otherwise, it would be "to fear a neglect of the legal protection of the personality".
The chamber court now has to clarify the amount of compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was naked locked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision that is unworthy of human beings, multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilets is also possible.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner unworthy accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009.
The plaintiff was housed between 15 and 21 hours a day in a cell of the same size as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also come into the headlines in recent weeks because of lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly included in 23 hours, the aggressiveness rises, even fighting is said to have come because of the tense situation.
According to information from the Legal Press Office, 21 jobs are not occupied in Tegel due to the lack of young people, 19 are due to be lost in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What will happen to Germany?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, as predicted by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to absorb one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this and we can do it".
What is happening in Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (250 000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rentals: 60000 to 80000 social housings fall annually out of the mortgage, and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the Pestel Institute's point of view: 80 000 social housing would have to be created each year and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year in funding.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation, criticises.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the reception society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants," says Migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: the ban on work for refugees for recognition of work.
While there was earlier a ban on asylum seekers from up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the obligation to reside in a place of residence for asylum seekers.
In society - also because of the lack of skills - the view has prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German skills.
So far, there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore in the view of Thränhardt the Königsweg for labour integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugees give their children into the kitas, i.e. ten to 15 percent: "It is first very important for the displaced parents to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handwriting in different languages.
If the need for educators is greatly increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example, by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for teaching in welcome classes without German knowledge.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no country prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated studies - the only exception has so far been Berlin, interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student-sponsored refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or tolerance no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicant's Act when they start studying.
The latter do not, in principle, receive a faggot, as they do not fall under the circle of the baffling persons.
In order to be entitled to Bafög, refugees who had been tortured had to live in Germany for four years, from 1 January 2016 this span is shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap also needs to be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Studentenwerk.
Students should be given Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to set up an Islamic charity that takes professional care of the newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the State in many areas and to give it certain control possibilities.
This includes the willingness to take a firm stand against religious fundamentalism.
The president of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "had their right to stay here immediately, in Germany," he said in the Bayrian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a matter of society as a whole.
This will also have to change the majority society, and the elimination of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has been an anti-discrimination body and a general law on equality for a limited decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants' organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-racism Convention oblige Germany to do in the coming years must become a reality if the country is to remain peaceful and make use of its new citizens' opportunities - for the good of all.
In general, Germany was able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity are concerned, we can do that," he said to the day's mirror.
However, this would require additional money to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands to hand out health cards to all descendants immediately upon registration.
Services provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long run, it would be highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided by the Asylum Applicant Act.
Otherwise, doctors make it primarily to create language barriers.
Already, Berlin's health scientist Thea Borde has proven that migrants are getting worse informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, the costs of interpreting would have to be taken over.
However, many refugees would already be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV information.
However, with some of the other forms of illness, German doctors would be aware of their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite seizures or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even see relief in view.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, several refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly re-examine them.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
According to Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK, refugee children are particularly vulnerable.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders suffer from, among other things, flashbacks with respiratory distress, dizziness, heart rate and death anxiety.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, intense horror and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
Up to now, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, but the treatment usually takes several months.
Moreover, in the social services, most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misapprehensions, Munz says.
Manege invites to dream
With the new staging "Leidschaft" the Circus Probst takes on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to drag every age group into the trap of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites into the manege on the brick to wash for dreaming.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Leadship" - under this motto is the current manegen production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the blood.
"It's important to get people away from their daily lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours," said the 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegen cocktail with world city flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 km tour can now experience this flair.
The circus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to take the Cuban duo more easily.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertips and jointiness.
Balancing the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Serpent humans fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little else and fascinates with her mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family", emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circuses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position: "If our animals are not well, we are not doing well."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read from the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go into the manege either.
The first commandment, therefore: well care for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a zebra nest, the family Tryst is proud.
The two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So every visitor should have something to do with it.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether it's five or 1,200 viewers, we always give our best and we're there with our whole heart."
The Circus Probst invites his performances daily from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 20 p.m.
On Sunday the program starts at 11am and 4pm.
Thursday is family day, for the show at 5 pm the prices are discounted.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe makes the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the Falls spread rapidly through the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also provoked by allegations by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous threats of death and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with convocations.
Last month they had bent him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Ganese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their cell phones that warned them to interrupt Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Dead'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament ends and, as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected downturn leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual revenue and "will be focused on providing hitherto unfulfilled, integrated technology solutions for companies," explains the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was called the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world’s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that closely focused companies are delivering better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was not until September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given its history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly ended the last season after a separate knee injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's no big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has shown 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League Clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, which have recorded most of the injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuky and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give players a little break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal's clear favorites are to move on through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lessons from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the association to its first European-Pokal-Triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
Arsenal's never worked.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year-old high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Misabel (CALM - Campaign Against a Disgraceful Life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "suitable mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of communication over social media, with its focus on style on substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vital and successful, even if in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The nice thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent embraces, moments when watching football in cozy armchairs and the longing from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a telephone salesman explained to me, "my hearing role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I am right with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in the moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the scenery completely redesigned for the celebration of the day, then why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course when Paris Saint-Germain launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince's Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champion's League debut as a PSG player who led the French champion on the way, but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a head ball port in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters, as they not only seek the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start, 2:0 to win, to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't made one or two more goals."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which on weekends could hold a 2:2 in their own place against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was expelled by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing storm was referred to as the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmo defense, before he closed by Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would win a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But besides a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who walked far to Kevin Trapps' post in the 34th minute, they offered little in response.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some shortcomings and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts patzed himself in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his co-players into play, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, which turned Di Maria into a spin, which was handed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention of Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute players Ezequiel Lavezzi became familiar with a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Hut before Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which is affected by devastating commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a sale of shares as part of its huge debt cancellation plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, struggles with falling raw materials prices, as China's economic downturn pressures demand and is devastatingly affecting markets.
The issue of subscription rights led Glencore's share price to trade on the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The share jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to settle about one third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on 25 September and will return President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state-diner after the two heads of state have held bilateral talks.
"Visiting President Xi will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a series of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address differences of opinion constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns regarding alleged cyberspionage of China and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.
440 PS sports cars borrowed and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in Gotha County, you can fulfill the dream and once borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
At A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into the sleigh on a wet road and went into the main plank.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage to property is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World champion and European champion Xavi has played for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
FC Bayern was obviously just a few years before Spain's Superstar Xavi, which was then playing for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champions, three cup winners, four Champions League winners, two club world champions, two European champions, one time World Champions - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, the 35-year-old left Barcelona FC after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already standing before the EM 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"They told me that Barça would sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
And that's what FC Bayern registered.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummengge wanted me."
Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria's season 2008/2009 would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king-class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking down
Matt Damon confronted African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen script of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then you do it when you fill in the film and not when you're on the show," said Damon.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulting disbelief and called out "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the comments of the actor of The Martian were strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," Brown first said.
The only black person, and she is a nut that is beaten by her white holder.
The producer of Dear White People was committed to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directors' rights in the film; Damon replied that their director "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved an impact across the country and forced legislators and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against colouring.
In February, singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matte", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement has published a statement in response to the Fox-News personality issue, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
The first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and take home the big prize of $1 million was Isaac Caldero.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten made it to the finale.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
British finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-hit victory, still under the shock of winning the big prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or been alive," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finals and why British, although he was the first ever to finish the course, do not get any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's holding any grudge over it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received lots of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak by Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the Tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted an opportunity to ascend within one half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard space.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three-letter F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then one in the sixth and then another in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit the 1/3 Innings 6 times and made three runs possible.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw in the bullpen of every game, and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated.
The engineered Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez' first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good when he was training, looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs in the finish at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks achieved a lot, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by the Left-Handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, in front of the designed smoke drummer Miguel Sano, who entries the right-hand Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Pluffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in this season in the Major League that Pluffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, the wall created an RBI double against the closure of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right-hand man, however, stepped out of Sano with three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit profited from the start of the game by a Phil Hughes who was not yet moving.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two Innings against the Right-Handed Veteran, who had been struck before the game by the injury list after he had missed more than one month due to a back injury.
"Of course not the beginning I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff battery in the first time, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right hand side, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers increased in the second, reaching a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center Field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever Right-Handed A.J. Eighth.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez escaped due to an injury to the throw shoulders.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list due to a shoulder distortion, should be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
He's been missing since August 20th because of a breakdown in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who were in need should then be accommodated in Wiesbaden in emergency accommodation, as the city Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She reckoned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving.
Several sports halls of the Hessische Landeshauptstadt had been prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
Over the past ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen, as reported by the government Bureau responsible for the initial reception.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria to be an option.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He called on the European states to "look away collectively".
Four years ago, one was glad that the chalice of military involvement in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
On Tuesday evening, Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner declared that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, this is agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Her goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU Member States have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Ministers for the Interior want to take a new start on the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday (September 22).
In view of the strong refugee trend in Germany, the Federal Government wants to strengthen its support for the countries in the first place and the distribution of people.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four-hour discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who needed protection would get it too.
But whoever has no prospects for staying cannot stay in Germany either.
This view has been strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU other than Serbia.
Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijarto said about the planned new border fence that Hungary wanted to prevent Schlepper from searching for routes across Romania.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
According to eyewitness reports in Turkey, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icepan of Saturnmonds Enceladus, a global ocean swells.
This includes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Thus, the moon easily tumbles around the ring planets on its orbit.
Although this cloud movement is only small, it is still too big for a permanent celestial body, it is said in a announcement from Cornell University in Ithaca, U.S. state of New York, of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" journal.
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, "Cassini" had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturnmond, spewing water vapor and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to dispense with Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association announced.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "predictively four weeks of forced break".
"That's hard on us, Rama is a heartless loss."
"Of course, we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "picture" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an uncooperative professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to prove its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the running training course.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash on his head.
In contrast with initial fears, however, he remained without a severe blessing.
No diet-fruit - Mangos contains lots of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often advised by them.
Mangos contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
Healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless: B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C are included in them. Mangos, however, contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruit thus support vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly.
The shell color alone does not say how mature the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. package service UPS sets up up up up to 95000 remedies for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are sought.
Already last year UPS had increased its staff for the holiday season by 95000 helpers.
In view of the booming online business UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making earlier arrangements to be armed for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First Fönnstorm, then prominent Kaltfront
In the next night, the valleys of the Alpennord side of the Föhn break through, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and on the night to Thursday the Föhn blows partly with storm strength through the Föhn valleys.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, wind buoys and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low pressure area across the British islands in a strong south-west stream.
On the Alpennord side breaks through the valleys in the night to the Wednesday of the Föhn.
As a result, the Föhn blows up until Thursday morning in the Föhn valleys with buoys from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and partly in the Urnerland also with over 100 km/h.
The Föhn can sometimes advance to the neighbouring central land, and on the mountains even hurricane buoys of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy Föhn ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the Alpensüdhang begins to stave.
Here we use rain that lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps has to be calculated in the next 48 hours with some over 100 litres of rain per square metre, after large amounts of rain have fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning the Föhn leaves the air, in which a cold front with strong, partially whited rain will roll from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind rises strong to stormy, and temperatures go back significantly.
The following days are presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees degrees, but in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on weekends.
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero", he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located right next to the Colosseum in the middle of ancient Rome.
The denomination had been requested by the working group of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
On Wednesday, Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled that Protestants in the city of the Popes for centuries as a minority often could only live their faith in the hidden.
The place becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months as a young Augustine monk around the turn of the year 1510/11 in Rome.
At that time he received the city as a scapegoat.
His negative impressions should have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later fight against Rome.
Luther then, with his theses against the indulgence trade, had initiated the division of the Western Church.
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns (golden) is one of the main works that Otmar Old painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bibel, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but which is by no means tantamount to "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the relevant topics, this can seem quite quite gloomy.
About three years Otmar has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books.
Cycles have been created that focus on topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments, or Fathers.
As a result, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages chosen by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today's contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old's painting.
They are embedded between Martin Luther's original Bible quote and an artist's sentence, which here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The bracelet has gold letters.
For example, the 75-year-old double allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, came from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant orders of Mr. Huder.
"The education was already done with the tubestock," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I have tried to work this out, perhaps even to tolerate myself again with the Lord's Father."
His second concern is to restore the importance of art in a fast-paced time: "The perception of imagery is today marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being forced out there.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the pictures, make them appear, discover and feel what strength they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "already always" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not care to grasp the Bible completely but chose the important, even mysterious topics for him.
"That was not a cooperation at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains." A picture book was created.
For Hans Möhler from Luther's publishing house, this work is an invitation to "enhance his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the original images - paper and canvas - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX train approaching
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, ground hill modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration provided for vice versa, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So pushed off hill, sought new place - now with formal planning and application for building permits.
The permission would be received in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to inform the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It was then to be started without "further commemorative break" with the work at the former indoor pool.
DFB strengthens commitment to refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga sets out a clear sign at the weekend.
Soccer responds to the rising situation in Germany and secures policy help in dealing with the pending problems.
"I think this has been the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"No one can say, in principle, that's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to everyone to get this topic under control," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I will be at the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the chancellor there."
"There the theme will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and wants to help.
However, the decisive steps must be taken to put politics.
The German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius-Braun Foundation we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach explained on the margins of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal liga­tors also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set out a clear sign when they will be wearing "We are helping - #refugeeswelcome" on the left-hand jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help, where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "image" magazine (Tuesday) and described the project as "of course".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, nobody can look away."
"We football federalists can, no, we need to use our radiation, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so badly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
For the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach called the support of refugees "a great joint work of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations in their places had started their own projects is great.
It's just as great that small and small associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome that we have spent is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, the Federation, together with the DFB election and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called the sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief Executive Officer loses an eye in the event of an accident
According to Bill McDermott, the CEO of Europe's largest software group has lost its left eye through a fall in early July.
During the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, after midnight he fell on a glass of water that he carried in his left hand, reporting the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, was faint, then dragged out on the street - he told us that last week," said the "WiWo" SAP co-founder, Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"In early October we met before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Süddeutsche Zeitung) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Anyone can do such a thing."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen down."
McLaren replacement pilot magnuses out of combat...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was crashed by the wheel.
Therefore, at the night run in Singapore on the weekend, he is just as little in demand as a reserve driver for the two standard pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as one week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfelder in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europe League.
The national player will be missing the football league leader in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"We can't get back to him unfortunately," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top-game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach released: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Due to the high strain of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stem cell on the Reus position.
Thus he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammährer Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level," praised the football instructor.
Whether weed traps are used in all European League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He will be very likely to contest the second game.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final move for the BVB in the Europe League had to be the goal, considers middle field player Julian Weigl to be comprehensible: "This is not so wrong for Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic Cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car according to the will of the federal government.
On Wednesday the Bundeskabint decided a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair of a "new mobility age".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
To ensure that the driver is not "burdened with any additional liability risks", the Federal Government intends to "verify the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The Federal Government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which has so far been intended only for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected well after 2020".
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars sceptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute commissioned by Dekra's testing organisation on Wednesday concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be enforced in the next ten years, 32 percent assume that they will not believe in it at all in 20 years.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the USA.
In any case, motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a survey of the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the journey on all roads.
At least 15 percent could be imagined on the motorway in running traffic, in stature 45 percent.
Good every four would leave the car under no circumstances to control.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis EM
According to the current state of the art, the Düsseldorfer wants to fight the title only in detail from September 25th to October 4th.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Federal Trainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at this time at a long-term sponsoring date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite," explained Single European Champion Dimitri Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who introduces the place list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo also missed, and we have become European champions."
"We should be oriented towards that," explained the world ranking books.
The English football player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has contracted a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit with a tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis suggested a shin break in the 20-year-old player of Bastian Pigeon.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figure cavern: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: window dolls, which, thanks to video projections, look terrifyingly human.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became Madonna's stage outfits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in a skirt.
"I can no longer say today that I am the Enfant Terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"In the past it was bleached, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Bürgersteig to the walkway), which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a good thing that the fashion creator has changed his attitude toward a show about his person.
In fact, he had been against it because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made at the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said Roger Diederen, Director of the Kunsthalle.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's almost overseeing work, which has written fashion history, without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall work of art for which much effort has been done: To freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist was dedicated.
14 tons of material have been transported by the makers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was still a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi says Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, sawful fashion round of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he dressed his Teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to.
He later taught himself the design of fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
For his first own fashion show he could not pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener lace as fashion niche
It used to be on the long embroidery machines in and around plauen to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, they further processed into blankets and curtains.
Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Plauen fashion centre, explains that this alone is no longer working today.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener peak, fashion played a greater role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
Overall, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past stylistic tokens, represents an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Embroidery Association together with nine other companies.
Only they may wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
There are almost no more private specialist shops and wholesale.
Our products hardly reach the customers in this way.
The bulk goods are today made much cheaper in the Asian space and almost exclusively distributed over chains.
Besides, export weaknesses, currently to Russia and to the USA.
So enough reasons for new paths.
The industry association is also trying to point out environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the sticker in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially tolerable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Ausstelle der Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and laces.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, high-quality and innovative products must be found.
It takes time and courage.
A field of tension arises between the freshest ideas of designers and the businesses that must especially think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revitalized the historic snowball tip.
In some places the machine sticks small balls.
Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krouße was inspired by this: "Before then, I could not start anything with traditional Plauener lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Spit - young and old," Reuter says.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a memorial.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen peak.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie.
You don't want to touch legends, but Disney is still expecting a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a re-filming, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It's about the Nanny's experience with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Anyone who plays poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi is pressing to open up the world's wider economy
The economy needs to open up to the outside in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, a group that was tasked with steering the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and to improving business start-ups strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access regulation, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), taking up private capital, and overtaking of the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it has a greater role to play in allocating resources to the market, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also ease control of the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Further areas for private investment will be opened as part of an offer to open publicly controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," said the statement.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as announced in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus achieve a significantly higher dose of neurotoxicity for consumers.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, critically criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant and young children with full weight," said Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values for nerve poison for large fish should be increased at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury today that on the basis of the still valid limits, about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold.
After double the limit, only 14.5 percent would be available.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limit for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, foodwatch called this "trick" because smaller cetaceans, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels today.
The lowering of small fish was therefore "a perfect diversional maneuver that only helps the economy," said Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "ready to cause low quantities especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage that there is no "health risk to the general population".
Mercury is mainly driven by carbon combustion into the environment.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry for the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants to the Green Bundestag member Annalena Baerbock emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fishes, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "continuously and extensively exceeded", the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year European-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU Warning System RASFF.
