Members of the Welsh Assembly worried they're going 'like fools look'
There is art literature among some meeting members on the proposal that their title should be changed from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members across the political spectrum are afraid that it could provoke a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it with Twp and Pwp rhyme."
For readers outside Wallis: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "receptible" about the name change, but noticed that it was a brief leap of speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what Members of Parliament are called, will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh parliament.
As far as the AM'e's title was concerned, the Welsh Parliament elected Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM'e seems to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to obtain consensus can be a headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, who has to present within weeks a bill on the changes.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the way the meeting works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question about what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country’s name
Selectors will vote on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to remove a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long demanded that the name of its neighbor in the north represent a claim on its territory and has repeatedly made a response to its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on name change, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's become silent because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historians spoke, say the old people to whom I spoke, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of the two is there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize these days in other ways," he said.
"Cows are no longer neighborhood family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and therefore will bring the day these churches complete close even closer, for most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
First David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillion in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carillion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carillion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says that Saint Martin's has not replaced him.
What has been playing at Saint Martin's in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, consisting of laymen--written in July to the diocese with concern that the diocese "will try to pass the cost" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in appointing the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark injured 13-year-old on a creek dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old son on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, said officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yell for help and then rowed closer with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized 'that he called, 'I'm bit!
I'm bitten!'
His whole collarbone was torn open," saw Hammel when he came out to the boy.
'I called that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'' added Hall.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Larry Giles said at a media briefing session that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams are fighting with department store-type beauty corridors manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods fall back, the larger beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if it is a success next year to more shops.
The investment in beauty takes place as supermarkets search for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's say that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include for the first time commercial names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique Grimming Series again so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more younger buyers are demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon in South London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain is trying to fight back against Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's placed Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains two years ago, which according to their grocery sales strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested in the early 2000s a joint venture with Boots, but the relationship was terminated after an argument about how to divide the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281-store pharmacy business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty paths to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our range of trade names are designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now an imperative beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away 'enraged' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their home clothes-and-coming business name, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trading name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing at the last moment from their lucrative lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl on Tuesday announced at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities - worth as much as £1.5 million - mean that she could not spend enough time on their home clothes-and-coming business name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trading name and would have doubled, according to inaugural Willoughby's planned £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed on a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the coming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was absolutely stupid to all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the announcement.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain’s stars that makes the most money inflow, can chase the company millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothing, and the possibility that its announcement may encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples have vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Tough words 'and close to falling in love'
He mocked criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would consider to be "unpresidual" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma-"newsreader voice."
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a big step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "consistent reaction" of the US on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic turn in his convention talk.
"We are making excellent progress with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim produced positive results — it ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and caused the rest of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into 'this crowded arena, we'd have almost 200 people standing just there," said Trump as he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Tidal Wave and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroyed Island, Dead Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was uprooted, no national disaster was announced, a pre-requisite to catalise international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which makes it a little difficult," said me.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are considering the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia continues to endure, the country is sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunamis owls were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu had probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning of strength.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at its best challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia’s elaborated infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign and spent money on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration is haunted by lack of funding as he faces next year’s reelection.
Mr. Joko is also under the pressure of insidious sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evasive like Christian and Muslim gangs fought with masons, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a prime loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported to Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea target and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he kicked far to the finish.
The attempt sailed high above the frame as it swung to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball hovered over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Edges coming and typing once and not thinking too much about it and just kicking."
Chelsea was by mid-term 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard recorded a target in the 25th minute.
The Blues goalkeeper replayed to Mateo Kovacic in that playroom with a back-up head before he toiled near the middlefield and intruded into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middlefield.
With a beautiful head forward, he led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defense and ended with a left foot-head past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the remotest net.
Liverpool fought at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
On Thursday, at 3 p.m. in London, Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the garbage of buildings that the earthquake, which struck Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, collapsed, and caused waves of up to 20 feet, said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspecting murder after wife's death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews in John Street at 7:55 a.m. with a knife, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to us.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who believed they knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are continued as the police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one in or out of the building was allowed.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now said to take hours before reintroduction.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She said repeatedly 'it's so horrible.'
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Any information requested to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymous at 0800 555 111 to log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the newest memorial with 'rewrite history'-dispute
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "sweetness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said, "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
Neither Cromwell nor Cromwell ordered the image - storming of the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the acts of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historical record of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it's a perfectly accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is established is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as patron is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murder Pigs Creeping Chinese Boer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China according to local media reports.
The man, who was only identified by his, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery covered with blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares on May 30, 2005 to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pighouse open.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were blooded and torn," said the cousin, who on his side was called "Wu", saying, quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 am to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A Mark Manager said to the Evening New that the pig was shut down to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the animal off.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're not playing.
They're picks, very curious... they're not interested in hurting you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Travel of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwest U.S.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa faints as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds from 5 a.m. to the east of 85 m.p.h., a Category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific begins to take shape and move east to the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards into the southwest U.S.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching trough over the coming days, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, waste, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place rainfalls of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Floods of ticks may be with rapidly worsening conditions because of the spreading nature of tropical rain.
It would be most unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep deserts to touch rivers and thunderstorms to bring violent local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a bit of local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall figures of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause slight waste and smooth rows.
It will be region’s first rain of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will cause Arizona to begin approaching Sunday and early Monday before the rain, making Monday and Tuesday more widely distributed.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense changes in temperature throughout the U.S. like what the Arctic is getting cooler, but the Tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There's a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, numerous summer heats will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern U.S. will start warm in October, with widespread 80's from the Southern Low Plain to parts of the Northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Board Kavanaugh trial
Over 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the stirring testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political point of death continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-fly custom: an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaughh bit her in drunkenness and tried to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, reported Nielsen.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where opponents shouted at him when he tried to take a elevator to a Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed down for a few minutes while CNN pictured how he was being reproached alive.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and had gone before the elevator door, said that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all later living hours when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would do it only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate for the following week, as requested by the Demokrat minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Demokraat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump conducted an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuse critics of 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political gambling" with Britain's future and subverting national importance in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May will meet for the Birmingham, Britain, Conservative Party Conference on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister of foreign affairs, Boris Johnson, with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, continued and said that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should advance each other's tariffs was "in total ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the trauma.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said that they had found Simpson’s DNA on it, reports CBS-defiled WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
The legal autopsy office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued on Friday a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University Police and District Citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletes Director Joe Alleva thanked District Law application for his "drift and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-footed forecaster grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 relapses per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "platting" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," said Wayde.
Volcano Spits Than On Mexico City
As spitting from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods reached Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after an activity in the crater and over 24 hours of 183 gas and ash releases.
The center monitored multiple vibrations and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin, low - gas motor windshields cover like Xochimilco in neighborhoods of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which has sunk 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 centraal Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists before commemoration of independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters collided with riot police, and thousands joined counter demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for retribution.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police stunned them with eggs and poured powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually teem with tourists.
A robbery also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their clubs to control the fighting.
Over several hours pro-independence groups sang on one tone "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the Unionists' screams of "Lank Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension still runs high in the independent region a year after the October 1 referendum by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatis-Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against repulsion who largely boycotted the voice.
According to Katalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried in violent clashes to prevent the voting from continuing at the polls across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but nudist victory in district elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties this year struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exiles or in detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in pretrial detention since last year, announced that he would be in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at some stage to the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s First Purpose for Livingston Ensures Victory
Promoted Livigston astounded Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose was proof of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed in the Premiership without a win and arrived next week in front of the forerunners Heart, which is their eight points ahead.
Rangers are host to Rapid Vienna in the Europaliga on Thursday.
Meanwhile Livingston expands their unconquered run in the division to six matches, with principal coach Holt still not having a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against bot visitors
Holt's team must have preceded them long before they had recorded a goal, with their round-breasting that had brought Rangers all sorts of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but acted in front of the target cage, then AL could only play wide after approaching and CH’s headguard met across the target cage.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death - dealing moments.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave off a freeship and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and draw from the center of the frame a goal.
By then, Rangers had dominated but could not penetrate the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a blow from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dissuaded by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow tapped wide to elude still open game of Livingston.
Earrings repeatedly reached and repeatedly stopped Livingston’s frame, while two penalties — after Halkett’s challenge from substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were rejected.
‘Fenonal’ of Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Famous games and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still outperform expectations on this uphill course.
Their game style and team have been virtually unchanged since their return to first rank, but quite a bit of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defense arrangement as Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they could at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate the home team, which is something of a wakeup call for Rangers, who are in middle division.
Erdogan Gets Mixed Receipts in Cologne
There were smiles and blue air on Saturday (September 29) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an outburst on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan is now Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000 strong crowd from meeting before the mosque, but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdokan protesters — many of them Kurdies — also thickened their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The combative demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as hero and by others as autocratic.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle smoker dies in collision with engine
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap in Childreners Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions were used in place, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six custodians injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, said the prison office.
Uproar broke out on Sunday about 09:30 BST and is still running at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guards" were called in to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said, "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and will be able to stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous wrongdoers.
In June, it was reported that the chief warden had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called in to pay attention to serious disorder during which billion - ball personnel were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kit Floods (Drope Areas Drag Dalk Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona but it's exactly what can happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings instant flood risks.
The National Weather Service had already issued instant floodguards for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by Monday it will approach with rain.
The National Resistance in Phoenix noted in a twist that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orca Center’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Kom, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with an isolated total of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those out of acute flood risk, Rosa's rain will probably be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drying Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s road leads to the approach of land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with a maximum of 85 miles [85 km] per hour, is 385 miles [385 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles [12 km] per hour.
The storm absorbs cooler waters in the Pacific, so its power decreases.
So it is expected that in the afternoon or evening, it will reach the country against tropical storm power in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfalls from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north of Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. southwest," said the National Orcan Center.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening flash floods and torrents in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys were arrested by a 20-year-old man under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found on Saturday at about 4:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stabile" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone image material of what has happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'had suffered under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered under the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday, and fervently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to her claim during the trial.
The President said on Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, is a voice to confirm one of the most competent legal spirits of our time, a jury with a pure record of public service," he said to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for these candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "stand and hinder."
The first important procedural voice on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, said a senior GOP leadership assistant to CNN.
Hundreds dead from Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were dead and many washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a feast on the beach, when surfers broke up on the beach from up to six feet (18 feet) high at sunset, many washed away after their death, and destroyed all that was in the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-range earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNP during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air pictures released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks shook the coastal city.
A range of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Evaluation and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s giant shaking was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which at the point of a long, narrow bay, could have made the size of the tsunami worse, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake reserve.
Communication "was completely impeded with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and added that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected area.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not inform us that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning had been issued.
In amateur imagery shared on social media, you can hear a man screaming at the bottom of the street on the top floor of a building desperate warnings about the incoming tsunami.
Within minutes a wall of water meets the beach and draw buildings and cars.
Reuters could not explain the image immediately.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power disruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, saying authorities, but evacuations still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates are rising above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, sheltering workers in decking shelters set up in their office courtyard, they passed by scenes of destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me that they had seen many houses that had been destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin with the terrible task of launching the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign aid workers are being very experienced in preventing travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, overseas funds, supplies, and personnel can only be deployed after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster on the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Good, it's a national disaster," we can open it to international aid, but it hasn't yet a status."
At the dawn of the second night on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
Sunday rescuers rescued a woman for two days under rubble was held with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paratrooper, trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian games that had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the paratrooper's field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under paratroopers' society, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were answered only with one gray mark, instead of two blue markers.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during refilling of OTM by Newport on the Life
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Life, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car was emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind the Brink's employee and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote, "The essence formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for some time been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurs before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye only – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs had been known, among other things, as Puff Daddy, P. Didy, or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has also completed with or without a connecting sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people died at a time when left - winged student movements were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attracted youth to gangs.
U.S. needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount it spends on research in that field, has said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made K.I. announcements, even though shortly the US has a complete formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they aim to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding may double the chances of reaching the next large AI performance in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980's at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that knocked the highest-rated American Othello player and later he was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It is not China that takes away the academic leaders; it is the corporates," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years appointed influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the US AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of an election committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire for months last.
Macedonians have to change voice in election or country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour’s name represents a demand in the area and refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the rise will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argued that it was a price that could be paid to pursue admission to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to such bodies as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, for it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a two-ringerness in parliament.
The state election commission said that by 1 p.m., there were no reports of inaccuracies.
However, the attendance was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small height and drew chairs for tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us into Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he cast his vote.
He said a "yes" outcome would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy at his goal in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine goalkeeper received a message from the middle field.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed by one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton Gorge.
He then pushed a gesture to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forecaster used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to knock the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," said City manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're happy that at that moment he'd set a goal."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga struggle.
The target came in the 29th minute.
At that game Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contacts before he led Sterling to the far end.
The Sky Blues’ forecaster kicked the ball in the net just before he was across the back.
City takel Hoffenheim in Kampioenliga Tuesday 12:55 pm by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies
With the Nationals out of play, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to start the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, which has a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promoter's location with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to tie their first division title.
"Although we don't play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play on the highest level from any point of I will face this year.
Why won't I want to participate in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but is reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will begin to have his 34th, had a throw-training session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outings in 220 2/3 turn this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing, and that's why I fight all over for these candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "One sees this awful, awful radical group of democrats, one sees it happening now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by any possible means, one sees the meanness, the genius.
They don't care who hurts them, who they must walk over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and strength; we won't give it to them."
Democracy, he said, is on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the Democrats "grief and mean and cowardly and false."
He referred to the name of Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Diane Feinstein, who had received a heavy crowd from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to place me under censorship, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Workers' Party LPs to whom we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatments because she boldly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy had different from previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers’ Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "kinder, more gracious" politics is long forgotten, if ever it began.
It became increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Workers ’ Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began soon after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with – whether about national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there follows a tirad of abusive speech on social media asking that I be not re-elected, disapproving politics from the core and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who each day face a flood of sexualistic or racist insults, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers' Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes worse.
For the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and that I will then be "Justice."
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Workers' Party 32 years ago, I have been encouraging the neglect of the Thatcher government, which has literally left my State High School, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I am different from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that is going down on a Brexit that is going to harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have drawn the final results slightly wrong, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the punting, the only unconquered team of ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, which carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested so far in our contests and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr front, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the contest by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unintended three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's lead with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest time a solo three intended to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, led by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long pause for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that had been carried off on a portable, and from the reboot Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall-three, intended by Climo.
Ayr's perceptive captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unspeakable three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of much pressure game.
The home team made a return and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had killed Climo without the ball, and from the line of punishment MacPherson pushed the ball to death after the incoming Ayr meal.
Climo intended it, after he also almost did from the reboot down, after Kyle Rowe got his goalhead David Armstrong and sent away flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star seems to start a new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star is going to move to the hospitality business after it has been discovered that he is designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedy thief Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the program’s last, and it seems that Kührer is preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kühr wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "florescence restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': surrounded by Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Matrose patrol a masquerade fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the rural Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – nesting the need to revisit the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is probably the highest that it was in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict by the international court on October 1st, after 5 years of discussions.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH verdict on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find favor with Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – also had many who depend on Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia would decide its favor — and that few would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict comes just six months after the last act shows that the case was "not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have delayed in the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric craved any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will once again continue discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to engage in after-sales discussions.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a Singapore conference between the rival countries' leaders.
His comments follow to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo evidently on the edge to restart nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead end, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and U.S. captivating to a statement that the Korean War ended also will bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump conference.
Paris fashion shows reveal new series of large head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or turn the sun upside down completely, you do not have to search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of slave big head coverings at their SS19 collection on the walkway that influenced the style of Paris Modeweek.
Extremely inexplicable hats went through Instagram this summer, and these designers paraded their staggering creations on the treadmill.
The spotlight by Valentino was a large beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other large accessories included water oranges decorated with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but it was not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute coutures.
One creation seemed like a scuba gear, including a snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The big hats follow shortly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over socialism sent another great creation over the walkway – a straw-breath bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit-dressed model that it wore.
The burnt orange raffia sac, finished with raffia freckles and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMIIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in shops appear for next summer – since the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized extras.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a ride performance of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community businesses.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school course, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable profession in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 secondary schools, showed that 72 percent of students received a grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now have the same reputation as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Occupations and Skills found in 2014 that 17 percent of the reasons employed provide why they have difficulty filling posts are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career anyone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and was French the only language spoken by a double digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why investing in today’s children’s language instruction is so important now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach that is considered essential to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore it should be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for followers to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday's opening season game.
But just how many minutes he is going to play remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell argued that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the forecast program.
"I didn't at this stage in my career need pro-season contests to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Convention Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of election assemblies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled contractions in the next week, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the currently held confirmation vote for his choice to fill the subjects in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming intercession because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's contraction in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online at it?
Trump's contraction in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see below through live stream to Trump's contraction in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation voice held up to a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main point of view of this excess is to help the Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five contractions were intended in the following week to visit "volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Management of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, to Reuters.
Tonight's contraction, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the voting patterns.
"It's not for Morrisey a good sign that the president must come to give him a boost at the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryderbeker 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have the courage to fight to keep the hope alive as they enter Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryderbeker needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an all-round sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like these.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They preceded with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I reckon," said Jordan Spieth as he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead of and twelve more being played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each one recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the clean ground, leading through his example.
That shrewd celebration cry became louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical sethouder to win the match four quite equally while he and Thomas were with two rounds behind.
His set-up, which won the game for them at 15, was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that one says to one that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You must really just take everything out and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That is all those players have left.
18 wells to print their stamps.
The only players who score more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Ryderbeker.
Europe’s unpaired but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't like one about track numbers on Saturday afternoon, but they also liked one Saturday morning about track numbers as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That leap, and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from this boisterous crowd, confirms that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can stand a potential European victory when the sun over Le Golf National is down.
Choose both at the same time or at different wells.
However, it is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short mats with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, playing with Alex Noren.
One thought about track numbers and two doubles on the front nine, the Spaniard and the Sweed ended up in a hole from which they couldn't even almost come.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to watch from close quarters because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into an instant.
Europe has so far always played better as a team and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the struggle that some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe walks 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they came out of Saturday's four - and four - game contests with an advantage of 10-6.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their count so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that had performed unequally in the morning's four balls, so that they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. faced more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they did not shrink back.
Jim Furik’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend is called "Moliwood," are just the second pair in the history of the Ryderbeker who have recorded four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played well together to defeat a father Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5/4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2/4-1 layer for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka-- which is first and third on the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their way.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a big tournament and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2/4-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3/4 in the four-games after losing the first two pieces.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder cup has a team recovered from a rear of four points when they enter the single game, even though Furik's team only has to play equally to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
After two days of being second best, however, it does not seem that they will succeed in a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will 'certainly not' unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would aggravate their mistrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri known North Korean complaints repeated about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons that would reward North Korea if it took gradual steps, his words seemed significant in that it did not unilaterally reject the removal of nuclear weapons as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "digestion of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Piongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of sanctions in order to reach their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions make our mistrust worse."
Ri didn't say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader had previously called attention to the United Nations in the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party had been on this issue of nuclear weapons destruction South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The tone of Ri's speech was still dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed to the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "fire pylman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea "in full, praised Kim abundantly for his courage because he took steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said Thursday to the UN Security Council, "Adaptation of sanctions by the Security Council must be zealous and without let up until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea in an effort to dry up funding for Pjongang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterward said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later that he had made "bondy demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also take a nuclear complex as the United States "conforming measures."
He said that Kim told him that the "conforming measures" he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all its undergraduate students get more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by opposing coffee-driven 'heeling sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant when it comes to the basic principles of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes to be the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep was--which surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
The course, first offered that year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students had been seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour course involves some interactive tasks.
In one department there is a picture of a dormitory, where students on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books should click to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term loss of risk from heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer can increase.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to study 'hellday' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said--even to avoid it from putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he went to Harvard during his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the damaging effect of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which may disturb your circadian rhythm and may cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal conquers Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarity away from daybreak when Dolly Menga's goalhead Steven Gerrard's incoherent team brought down a 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win first as visitors to St Johnstone since February’s 4-1st season, but Gary Holt’s team just turned Gerrard down as manager in 18 matches so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem that a Rangers team would be playing without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target.
And there can be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown away.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred-beker.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a tip from Hearts last week and he would have been in his noppies with the way in which his well-trained team had smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They were actually to score points after just two minutes when Menga’s first shipment of Scott Pittman passed through on Allan McGregor’s purpose, but the middle field player opened his great chance.
A deep bluff by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow could only miss kicking at the rear target pole.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have had a sentence at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots at the target during the first half but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a tame target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it is just for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple rounding.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but drove the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett who palmed long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in far from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a criminal head when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sondaggend" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TELTHER ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of support in pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Oh, my God, that's about it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to 'see' predator cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predator cells
Dust learns immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein 'see' which is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify predator cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is found in many cancers and is called HER2, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 " drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West, after acting on SNL, began with a pro-Trump ridicule, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was on a Saturday night live in the studio after an elaborate action in which he believed the U.S. president Donald Trump and said he would be elected by 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he sailed out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white person and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it was not broadcast, the material of West’s imagery was loaded onto social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the platform about what he was wearing on his head.
"They have bound me behind the stage.
They said, 'don't go out with that hat.'
They've been controlling me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West went forward, "Do you want to see the low spot?" and said that he would put on his "superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comment prompted at least twice an outing from the audience and members of the SNL roll division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio has become deadly silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhythm chatter Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was greatly surprised by the performance of song I Love it, dressed as a perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who was bred: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU TO THE CARE."
But chattering program hostess Karen Hunter argued that West was simply "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe accept an ideology and preach that endangers my community.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme chatter on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the essence that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Mede-rymklätser, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, cool musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder of a knife shop in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in East Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackakamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in front of the Belfast County Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swordswept role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasyreek Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often mean that young boys feel that they must be tough to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he said 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his associate from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about making this issue work.
'I personally feel quite strongly about it at the moment--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have our husbands learned as they grow up with regard to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its extremely male characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time--how do we change it?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men."
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones-prejudice-and-purchase pieces when the series next summer came to an end, for he said he was 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November onwards Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife, Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygrette, the love-interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy rex.
The couple married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced that there was a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, their health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, representing a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who acquired HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
MIV sex transfer is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70 - 90% of men having sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to take action on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked GOP senators' data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'college theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters sailed on Saturday against claims that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were driven by "ultraright" experts and Web sites.
"Lues, lies, and yet abominable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The selected information reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S.A. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of them from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's trial of the claims of sexual misconduct against the nominee for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative Web sites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the placements was related to the Waters office and made known the information of a member of Waters staff, the Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information and security were put in jeopardy because of this deceptive and false claim--was by no means responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly triggered online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she did not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When accused of something he has not done, do not be angry.
He should not be defiant.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Apparently, Fleischer compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of seemingly being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to light Waters in the inter-election from the pillows, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he whipped.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
"We shall make sure that the stewards are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for all that they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spy spotting
It is now traditional to look for Brexit in any new movie with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English action comedy mockery raffles - which then began with Johnny English in 2003 and struggled with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-choices evenate on the subject of how obvious power we are being the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the unhelpful Johnny English with his eyelashes and rubber face has made his license to waste everything up for the second time renewed--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comical creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot from that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire-themed song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of mysteries, who left chaos behind him, who once played Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored garment and cut the screw blades briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy is shown but the humor feels quite faint and strangely redundant, especially when the "serious" movie trade marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now using self-confidence as a component.
The humor feels that it is aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s adversities are not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent - film jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in service--a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a blown-up and besieged character, who's already experiencing a total collapse of political indifference: Emma Thomspson does her utmost with this quasi-teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy is in danger, she must call someone out of retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at some cool institution, but that gives lessons from the record on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a school or rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commanding officer, an allermapstieks-roll in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin of it are to completely waste everything in Her Majesty’s secret service again in service and come to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant, causing them chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite a bit like children's TV.
Fairly mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop myself thinking: couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent his right?
Work denies that it plans for Britons to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to be paid a four-day week work--but for five days.
The party allegedly wants company base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution to be passed on to workers by giving off their extra day.
It'll make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they'll still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it would be 'pass' to the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favor of the workers.
To change to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as to the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day working week during his campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is not currently endorsed by the entire Workers’ Party.
A spokesman for the Workers' Party said, 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Skado Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'secular directors' and 'winners' from service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment as a labor government can make 'deductions' on the grounds of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company directors and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private - sector enterprises to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delayed and raised the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican sensibilities. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could deepen anything they could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done it?
He was determined, certainly, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett diligently denied it," continued Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the World Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness for the opportunity’s real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the World Poverty Project, an international interlocutor who hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concerters had to send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call, or any other significant way to create awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivisime" people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twist?
Since 2011, World citizen says that it has recorded over 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that would potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and developers who are committed to "help children reach their full potential", and promise to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and World citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
World citizen answered, "It will be a long and hard road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-separity movements in front of us, we will succeed, because we have more strength together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be present at this year's event in New York by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use fleets for "blockades" to prevent export of Russian energy - Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, the U.S. minister of domestic affairs revealed Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed Russia's involvement in Syria -- especially where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to take it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zince addressed the participants of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit hunt that views themselves as the "vote of the energy user" in the U.S.A.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they were the same in practice.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The verdicts come as Trump administration was on a mission to give a boost to the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officers, including America's president Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which according to Trump Berlin's "captive" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked counterreaction from Germany, reaffirming their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren would "seriously consider standing as President in 2020," said the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts' senator, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" standing as president after the mid-term elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing it.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman on the highest sport," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6 I will seriously consider standing for President."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting and said he'd take the country the wrong way.
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a twist Friday, Warren said "of course we needed an FBI investigation for our vote."
A survey released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters did not think that she should be standing in 2020.
Eight-and-fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be standing, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe survey.
Twenty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick had to stand, with 38 percent who supported the idea that he had to stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to stand possibly in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biding said he would make an official decision in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump's convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he goes through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who sense the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers return," she said to an audience during a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air forces and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, infesting with a complaint of domestic violence, and possessing a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eight states and the Columbia District support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the county filed a friend-of-the-court legal mission on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang members," mistreated her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents that fled from domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "regards decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such attorneyial practice violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court legal order.
Procurators further argued in the legal order that the policies which immigrants refuse access, harm the US economy, and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "will provide necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims who were fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems — even all serious problems — that people face all over the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly curious.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old Ma Risa Kusuma as she comforted her feverish baby boy at a evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen seeking their return to their devastated homes, through drunken possessions, to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-range quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are being treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he related the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' ruins, I think," Haris said to Associated Press and added that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'clouding' with 'propaganda advertisement'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of U.S. China trading, the U.S. ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily’s paid inset in the Des Moines Register – the state Iowa’s newspaper with most sales – after accusing China of interfering with the US Congress elections of 6 November, a complaint that denied China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led to their tariff rounds being equal to each other's imports.
China’s reprisals early in the trade war were aimed at beating exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, saying Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast to that, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing one will find very limited aberrations and not see any true reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic tragedy, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that although "one of China’s most prominent newspapers shone away from the offer to publish his article", he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's electors for inter-elections with Kavanaugh-debacle, warning analysts
While many top Republicans stand at the Supreme Court-renowned Board Kavanaugh and defend himself in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see counter-reaction during the coming inter-elections, especially of women.
The emotions of this are enormously high, and most Republicans are on record indicating that they want to proceed with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s appeal for an FBI investigation would be close enough to appease fierce voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they're not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman to the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters "November is on their way!" roared as they argued in the Senate entrance hall while the Republicans who chose the Judicial Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford reported to Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news outlet.
"People say it was already high; it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among swinging female voters in the suburbs and younger voices, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony that outlined the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-reputed, analysts said that if Republicans continued to confirm it, they could follow a counterreaction.
"It has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaughh is put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," pointed Guy Cecil, director of Priority USA, a group helping to elect democrats, to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with slightly more to the side of the latter.
A new recording of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely jogging during his testimony, whereas only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s appeal, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate's Legal Committee that Kavanaugh was assaulting her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-renowned his genitals exposed to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launched a start-up event that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt was "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, business lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about announcing a complete change even if not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
In a place on Medium which was published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol honorary Bernard Vann acquired the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, he won his battalion over the Channel de Saint-Quentin "by very dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before he stormed man-only a field rifle and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I know I can never stand up to, but something humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff at the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youthorkes.
Michael Vann said he "felt honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night watching the packed Bellator 206, just not being able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to the battle, viewers in the UK were left silent when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unembarked after staying awake especially for the fight until early hours.
One supporter described on Twitter the switch to the children's drawing as "one or other sick joke."
"It is government regulations that the contents were not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the re-dispatching, I think we can probably figure out something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were many text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six — as we normally do — and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just go over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has a 'minor' sense of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he was venturing his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less care about winning at the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, for "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are of less sense than, and otherwise feel, the true things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's League games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He says he lied because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "caught him aside."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference was never a matter.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became in June parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal,' he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father didn’t accept his death and one of the last things he asked if they had tickets for London in 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about for a long time – to dive in front of my hosts at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first songwriter — Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in building up the Olympic Games and still giving him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson didn't drive and withdraw from Saturday's Ryderbeker
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Furik for Saturday's matches and fours at the game.
Instead of being the centerpiece of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-month Major winner will divide his day between being a race leader and on the top of his playing work in the hope of correcting what is happening.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the direct driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long ravine always punishes the erring blows.
And as if the track on its own were not challenging enough, Mickelson came on Sunday in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mikkelson’s game can be absolutely essential.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role which he had today, gave me a knock on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes Hall and has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine that he would play two games.
I put more into perspective, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most of the Ryderbekervet matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryderbekerbekniskaner track that never really corresponded to the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson said that although Furik said that his presence had contributed to the team, 18 wins, 20 bearings, and seven halves.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, like to shave the nut, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just gambling."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage for the last day's single game in the Ryderbeker can easily turn into an awkward experience.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only a nudity won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won a nude rap," Bjorn said, in the photograph, after watching how the class of 2018 won on Friday 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 ahead of Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You will be perfect tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I still say, I focus on the 12 players who are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoicing about how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds, "I'll never get ahead of this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different colour.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It is wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you are individually there, you are tested to your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you have to convey to players, most of it comes from yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he must also find the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furik would want his players to do better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points out of four.
Fury himself had been changed on both sides of that great last day, where he was part of the Brookline winning team before he as lost when Europe had achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every dismal word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, spoke courage to his players on his way to that last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins in one direction, it puts much stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and divided the men whom we felt, you know, will bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and comes in the main contest against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I've chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it up to the end," Bjorn said about his single-game options.
Germany’s New Warrior Reexposed
The German army’s newest frigate would have been employed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Time-Courant who quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Fleet in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, an air defence and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships — evidently enabling Germany to project power overseas — will become obsolete by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
Last year, the disastrous F125-fregat reported when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss-sährswert in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to deliver it to a shipbuilder.
Few are known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing the performance of the work, and reducing the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" are thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the pricing label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – has also become a matter.
It has apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have gripped the new frigates are especially important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are getting caught up."
The official clothing said the issue worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg classes could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bat as well as the brown langor and Daubenton bats at Inveverewe Gardene in West Ross.
Special surveyors will be placed on the property at important locations to locate bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert clone channels of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species are doing.
A Habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a NTS conservation adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Mouse populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to show bugs and obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform surveys and sleep - place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reservation at Threeave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Farmer David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threate we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the need to seek for bats for the maintenance of property, because it is possible that unknowing destruction of a single litter of up to 400 females and babies' death can mean and an entire local population can be eradicated.
Bats are protected, and killing, disrupting, or destroying their sleeping spots is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo executes rape raids while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo finished rape-convicts against him as "false news" and said that people " wish to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus actors were accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he addresses his 142 million followers, published according to the claims, Ronaldo, 33, closed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time balloon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," added the player smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyer is getting ready to sue Der Spiegel for the claim, which they, according to Reuters, called "unallowable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensus.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
34-year-old says she wants to reverse the settlement now because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged assault on the point of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if their car manufacturers lose
The UK 'would regret it forever' if they lost their status as world leader in motor manufacture to Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would have to cease production temporarily at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-agreement Brexit could cost posts.
Last year, the Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say feed chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line runs on a "just-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for vehicles made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border which the industry says could lead to delays and defects in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "performances calibrated to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he said to the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but warned that adding costs in the long term can reduce the plant’s complicity and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite-unie conspirator on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back again.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump encounter with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "exposed with another week" while the fighting over nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible cross-bombing of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is going to resign the deputy attorney general or not, and as a result of Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip has been on fire for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recording recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choice not to give thanks" to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump postponed a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said, "A date for that is not yet determined, it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not because of an obscenity for TV journalists who are "effekbejag," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they're hunted."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence, "We have looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly for the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and at times, bizarre appearances before journalists gathered there.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU personnel working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express their wish for Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote to me: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the road to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also intensified their preparations for a possible none-match scenario.
I know it is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, and that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he contracted a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee team Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s principal trainer Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and sort of collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no details yet about the type/length of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season on 18 barrels of death.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasure expects to raise up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be passed on to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The excess tax – which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set two years ago on second houses and houses bought to rent — can be as much as three percent.
The Treasure expects that this move can bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens who boost the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital city – have become "poppers" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by picking up land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to renounce quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's housing disaster.
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of planned housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "no error deferments".
He also wants to give greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a far-fetched dream, and the humiliation of homelessness has become too much reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is at one point to become the manager of Scotland.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North-East team, currently in third place in Liga One, three points below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premierage last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I often looked as a child with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it is something that I withdraw.
The opportunity, however, can only come if I succeed in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of following such established names at such a large club, after he had previously turned down presentations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'At the moment success will be measured to me by '' can I cause this club to return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful if I can get the club out of there again."
Ross's career in management was only three years, after a period of as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Heart's staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and turned St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he thought back to how he had taken over Alloa's leashes.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, for I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it and lived up to reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things in which one must come weekly.
I still go through it with the stress and pressure of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the full interview on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling pubs ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking sites and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but receipts in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, showing figures.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, which compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as the previous month, June, when drinking places were at 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even heavier.
The 1.8 - percent drop in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking places and bars did far better and rose more than restaurants did.
Kos-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Around managed bars and drinking places, sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, with food down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the greatest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-house-out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent year on year would be particularly difficult above and except for constant cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowing down in trade - brand announcements.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK’s drinking area, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is the established benchmark in the industry.
One out of five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – has uncovered secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
Recording of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in false Insta pages
The news has raised fears of sexual content being placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a principal account to show parents.
One in five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that keep them a secret from adults.
A recording at 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in false Insta accounts – a reference to the photo library Instagram.
The news heightened fears that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents but also had private accounts.
One mother who came down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they have private bills.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot locate them."
Elidh Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on Scottish athletics
Eilith Doyle was elected to the council of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body’s general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field runner and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far reaching experience at international level during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic society and we are sure athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the advice," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC connoisseur, unable to walk after having a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only the time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it fully recovered, again learned how to walk, and does skill exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Borspompathal vortices that compare mothers to cows divide opinions online
A breast - pumping company has split opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast - feeding mothers to milking cows.
To celebrate the launch of what is called the "world's first silently portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk out.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the size of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The courgette says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'll run the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'll milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the firm’s Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reaction from viewers, with many saying that it was subverting the "griefs" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
After we have to get pregnant and give birth to them in order to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days after they gave birth," wrote one.
The Elvie-Borspump fits discreetly in a diet (Elvie/Mother)
Another person remarked, "Receptively traumatizing for mother and baby.
But yes, why doesn't it use to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "screamnaak."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had still breast - fed.
To milk out made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another person said, "It's a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who milk out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cow."
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is still silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly in a diet that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother said: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a large and provocative reputation.
By drawing a parallel between women who milked out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking-out process and all its challenges into the spotlight, while in an entertaining way where people can connect, we demonstrate the wonderful sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the walking board for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of continued migrant children increased sharply, partly because of fierce rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration which make it more difficult to place children in bail.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country was being jeopardized by taking steps forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible bonds and other adult members of their households should go their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and customs maintenance before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to bail out unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are depositors or household members of depositors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the children, officials set up new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconferencing call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child's difficulty is more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many already have.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘conquistadors’ to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in his eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "managed accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, is "more than" by.
He said that Damascus will continue "to wage this sacred struggle until we have purified all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has trained and advised about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the question of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "distributing irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to fascinate these returnees," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be merely a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement resisted a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "distinct spear times" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda coupled Nusa Front who would be "cut off".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "following the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second termin
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandal end his presidency early.
In what without a doubt "the most dramatic finale of a president will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak time viewing rates have doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top of cable viewing numbers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted, for it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "For he makes me laugh," told me. Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, who can reunite and reunite the health of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward's "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather fly jacket ("a garment thick of the hubris", said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look again at Super Mario in the same way.
"Something he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's alternating role-sharing and daily cheeks in the plot (such as looking for a fight with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll stay behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC as he recorded CNN.
He could not tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh, on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balances.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs back then and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outwards stream to the most exciting middle-term election races in Home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th inflow of money is seen due to a shift of congress districts that have now led two officials into a race around the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure strength.
Lamb is standing against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally defined in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th ran off with a campaign finance competition between the financial legs of the major parties, the Democratic Veldog Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nudist victory in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts gave a slight advantage to the Democrat.
U.S. thought of penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China but then turning back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the State Departments decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "future decisions to stop acknowledging Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were considered just against El Salvador who in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reduction in financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference and focused on security and economic progress to follow up a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue effectively to put an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for Middle October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new severe messages or rigors from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible thrashing of the law, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also thought to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia worked together in the country’s attack on our elections.
If the Congress were to change hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body, just when he was preparing to go back before the voters, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
It's a lot of aces, and I don't want to imply that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions that need to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be accomplished.
In 1938 German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West had just opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia-Slovake at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years' slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy’s merciless course is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face various such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump, deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein, dismisses the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed to take the president up secretly last year and speculate on whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times ’ report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the middle selection for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we watch those tests, there lies a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived at a time in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to go to light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With it as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimism for Rapid Vienna-striked
Rangers are playing hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equal outcome in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season up to the 2-2 equal outcome against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this rash as a springoff for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but an equalization is probably a just outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game, because they've had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there is a good sense factor at the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, last season behind us and succeed."
Women lose sleep over these retirement savings fears
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their husbands about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal battles at the pass.
Get a health-care proxy in place so that you assign a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider also empowered for your finances.
Choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are inadequate.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent had a medical emergency and was on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details out in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It is not just the financial issues that are involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What Is the Medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with wind pants
A man was shot several times with a sweater as he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place by about 02:30 BST, as a "quick act."
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police asked witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and it is expected that the death toll will rise.
With communication put out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala Regent, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-range quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a reindeer that stretches along more than 300 km (180 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The government, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times during the past 100 years by tsunami, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A Tsunami also struck West Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake on the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami hitting 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths off the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Niash, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populated island, resulting in a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-range quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-range quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat quake struck the Pidie Jaya Regent in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It did not this time lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that have collapsed,
2018: Major quakes strike Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, is arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, intervened with a report of domestic violence and resisted arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took away a female knowledge's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held at a $500 unsecured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decided" when he was asked what he pleaded, reported the network.
Palin is staring three class A crimes in the face, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and $20,000 fined.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2.000.
This is not the first time criminal complaints against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of Alaska’s Veterane Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-range earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach holiday in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death sentences for suspects in NYC terrorist attacks
New York federal prosecutors are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been carried out in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bike path along the West Side motorway in Laer Manhattan to scrape off pedestrians and a cyclist who was on his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty, lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both those charges carry possible death sentences, according to the court paper.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized criminal cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "delicate planning and premeditation," said prosecutors and described the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov suffered injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro causes Damian Pagnucco," said the intentional announcement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York legally prosecuted a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced to a plot to perform spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were teased with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently for the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team formerly asked persecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "hot" from Euroskeptics – since one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that by then the UK "would be out" as Mr. Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces to unite her deep-stretched officers was suggested by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan in motion amid attacks by Brexitians, Remainers, and the EU.
Bonds insisted that she would press the door in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the death penalty – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said for the Loop, meaning Loop Convention in Solihull, that he wanted "Chequers cast out."
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a nobleman and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in control, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be in subjection.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone suggested that since the 2016 vote, public opinion had changed: ‘The idea that British people had changed their minds and wanted to remain completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenyns was also on the march and told reporters: ‘ I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are selected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Fark told me that the convention politicians had to feel the "hot" if they were on the threshold to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'Now it's a matter of confidence between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in the city center.
Some activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the release of the group this weekend.
Workman Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
‘It is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,’ he added.
‘It’s a total trick.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to ‘look at it hard’ to stand for President
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP stands for Rep Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with founders using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
An observer asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren answered that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and it locks in a woman all the way up."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University’s campus.
"Wayde Sims caught a shooting in the head and was finally dead because of it," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media at 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he was on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and confessed that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 younger who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 leading seasons and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 backballs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clings to world title after team orders give him his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the races.
From paupposy, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fattel went first into the wells and left Hamilton to drive all the way back into the bundle of traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes drew a round later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action which the Ferrari driver saw leaving counter-risk-free the inside at risk of stamina after a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the rear row of the roadway jumper and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large portion of the races, as he held on to his bands to get ready quickly and to pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells on the 44th round but could not accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did extraordinary work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It was right bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked on Saturday at a convention Senator Diane Feinstein about her urge that she did not lick Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court-renowned Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not address directly the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "compassionate and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has gone on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at explanations and leaks and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... you licked the document--" oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it... no, we didn't lick it," he added, in front of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that explained the charges back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September — but Feinstein denied the leak from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't lick her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented during Saturday evening's convention: "I tell you what.
She may not have, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-renowned, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, and suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own ends.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who hurts them, who they should drive around to get power and control," said Mediaite, reporting the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the battle 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-target lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ guidance.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee together before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen targets tied their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who had lost first matches and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull-help, with David Rutherford who offered help when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took direction until the first break in when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again got them equal with a power game goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of winning with his team’s fifth end halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next game Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of airplanes can escape
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane that carried hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues who had fled for their lives, 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained unmotivated to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, was able to climb safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he dayd that it inflamed.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaking for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency that says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is restricted.
"It is believed that the death toll is still increasing since many corpses are still under construction while many cannot yet be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Floors that reached six meters, took Palu, who would have a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute an ambulance brings in a body.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military service: "I ask the almai of you to work day and night to complete each task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed over 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after shorewater plane crash
The airline handling a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not give account of a male passenger.
The airline said that they work with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the collapse and the exact succession of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"It's a particularly good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium - deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the planes panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships working near the improvement of a wharf also helped with the rescue of an inflatable boat to get people back and forth on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analists set aside a timeline for the evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell records to put together the motions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was together Chambers the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford witnessed that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "jok, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction is that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that for a while after Chambers died, Tellis Chambers deleted his messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He assured her of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin his final pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common saw a recent revival in the UK by such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Enough black person?
NY-kinderjouffroud date couple because she was fired after "racial" text
A New York granddaughter sues a couple for discriminating resignation after she received a misaddressed message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the dispute with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her apprehension when she learned that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEET NÓG A SWART PERSOON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice.
After she found out her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed my Maurice and said that their outgoing babysitter who was African-American did bad work and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages on the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do so well," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple looked back on the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to stop Maurice’s occupation and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said Man Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case to "depression" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
As the case continued, the court of public opinion was quick to put the couple on social media and cut them off for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not link readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fiery if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death was "bitter sweet."
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-grained man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success kind of that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hi to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
'Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"When I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dearly.
Soon I will be with you.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the beat was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it unfolded.
I couldn't tickle or scream or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who by now was hurt by the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the trial she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had lowered my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on flight I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving Women Mail Cards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work at preventing others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been mailing cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis ’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I do every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile clarified any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I keep worrying that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you should talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his posture.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day--when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It jerks a hole through the family.
It rips us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Board Kavanaugh's future was still undecided as the FBI began to investigate.
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he had asked for--a timeless investigation that had no scope--could we possibly bring some unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under entangled party accumulation.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to investigate the FBI?
Their obsessiveness is all because of timing.
The intercoms are gone only for weeks, on November 6, if, as is expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man whom they want to have chosen to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivers its report?
There will be a voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaughh can reach at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which Mike Pence, the vice president, will allow to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overruns number 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Beeong-suck quoted data from the South’s unification cabinet and said that last year there were 1,127 wars - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human smugglers has been key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of survivors from the North are finally being offered South Korea civil rights.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DSS) between the two Koreas.
Rather than refugees, China considers the survivors to be illegal immigrants and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South who are still technically at war with each other - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks centered around the striking negotiations on nuclear weapons removal.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to cooperate for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries," says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court-renowned Brett Kavanaugh "histeries" and said that he was Temperamentally unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted this way, they would say 'histeries'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost screamed and stinged as he discussed his family and his high school for years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "minor and co-ordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against democracy.
"I think he disqualified himself from those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he had been confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he isn't competent to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. bypass appeal court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on affordable care or Roe v. Wade since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women need to handle it.
It's a righteous diaphragm, months and years' anger that boils over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for broom because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office was where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by an older woman by my neck -- a cold manager for whom I was a little scared--who dragged me into a treportal.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will rejoice, because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extra-legal relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, I found Schroeder, very frustrated, that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snowy and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finds collections and so she vowed that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave men $1,000, she would only give $250.
"Think they I get discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her talk and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated by the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry for the sexism--that she strangled.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder about how the press had reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate bail.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She cried."
How the U.S. Shina Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the US and China had been obsessive and while the battle is far from over, a dispute between the countries may be in the long term beneficial to Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by burdening important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs that affect $200 billion (£150 billion) of items and effectively halved the goods that come into the US from China.
Every time Beijing retorted in goods, prices of from five to ten percent were closing at $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-for-shoot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to meet the US's requests publicly would be too much of an embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing is playing its cards right, pressing over US trade war over the long term can positively support China by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could start an economic toll air in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than those spectators have known before," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the land that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures that their daily lives and their existence have taken.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flattened land.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had backed up the invasion.
Europe seal Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and team U.S.A. with a final point of 16.5 by 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, let his T-hold in the water at par-3-16th hole and gave up his contest to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari blinked in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players ever to go 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament's current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was launched 5/4 by the lowest - ranking player on the European team, Thorbjorn Oles of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, has 2 and 1 cases to land Poulter from England who may have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder beakers, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner at all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the torch over to his compatriot John Ram who conquered US golf legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in a few games.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at that old one," said 23-year-old Ramm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. struggled all weekend to find the clean ground with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furik spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys.
There was this morning when we put a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat down.
We're outnumbered."
