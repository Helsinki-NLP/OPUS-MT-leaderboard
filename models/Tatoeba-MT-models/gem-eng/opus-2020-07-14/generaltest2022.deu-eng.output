The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# Großkunde and therefore it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction which I should attach to the package so that it can be traced back by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another possibility of the credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be attracted to taking on a parent role for their small siblings.
However, I think big siblings also do well to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a look, help briefly, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is working alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best assess for yourself whether this fits your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him to bed for hours.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps, therefore, the psychologist's statement also comes.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your estimate ;)
Help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago, and I can still remember almost the whole story, but I don't want to get involved in the title partout anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was of fear and treating them.
At the beginning of history, an animal caretaker commits suicide by overburdening himself with food and going to his breeding cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation of his therapists, operates a clinic where he treats patients in fear.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos into the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist conducts some kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides with intent to die)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there is a large showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough story I am quite sure that the book was written in original by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or anyone could even betray the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, yes, I didn't have the password available for the Wlan.
Must first contact my husband.
But that can take some time.
What steps must I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded ?
Child, 4 j., Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wood splitter over the entire length under the thumb nail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a pinzette.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow it's for a doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost every locomotive of the track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders will automatically report to a suitable digital centre.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with appropriate control stations.
For headquarters that can program only the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses enable 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable control unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration at Mfx® compatible centres.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake trains as well as the ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage.
In addition, he also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automatic allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC circuits.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to pursue booster vaccination
Getting new Omikron cases policy and science in the UK.
By the end of the new year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England are to receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the Corona revamping vaccinations in view of the rapid increase in Omikron numbers than it has so far sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have elapsed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.
In view of the Omikron variant, we are faced with an emergency, which is why vaccination needs to be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Let's get angry now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, which increased the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am for everyone to introduce themselves with pronouns
I got rid of an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a somewhat complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background here, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to cross the feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Just the one I bought today isn't going
Obviously, the chair had an undetected defect in the sale.
How else can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
It's been working for about now.
No more 14 days.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and I wanted to buy 8 of them.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to your order and invoice it.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write here something detailed about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) contact victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really approaches me, and unfortunately too often occurs, is that many victims are not being helped or think we could not help them.
I'm quite clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and range of hearing I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment to get the kids out of this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is sometimes very close to tears myself, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, always remember that it is worth living without violence that is so unbelievably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the "League of Legends" series do?

Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball League: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg bei den Merlins Crailsheim
At least at Youngster Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Nothing again: For the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the Cup defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We still have some rage in the belly".
However, it did not lie down after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball League.
More than the naked result disappointed the way the performance was performed.
The deputy is called a statistics that express the whole dilemma: The three-quota score was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all of the young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer delivered John Patrick: "We simply weren't focused enough after the teneriffa victory, and we didn't implement what we trained."
It's like moving the ball.
His opposite reaction to Sebastian Gleim was quite different: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and the game led his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," added Gleim.
While in Patrick's team itself the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already located 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, much time to hate does not remain.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I called in a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have written them again for this reason.
We originally reported ourselves half a year ago.
Sites like plucked from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He manages to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of batons from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there will be nothing of it.
The scheduled concert was scheduled in May 2022 - "on authority" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent period must first fail, as it is called on the singer's website, which will be 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to recover their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and liked to sing as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with communists.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of percussionists and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonisists.
He has been awarded prizes many times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013) - reached the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair strongly combs back and is based on labels, Max Raabe is no longer thinking away from the current music landscape in German.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It is supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check first whether it fits in colour
It still doesn't work. I can only long for the cover sheet, but I can't leaf it.
Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created due to expropriation
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as requested in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation there is not a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the traffic lights coalition about further tightening of rental rights.
The coalition agreement foresees a rental brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market is not relaxed, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 deaths from tornadoes in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been dragged through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 dead could be to complain.
The pictures from there remind us of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes of the United States have caused severe desolations and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometre-long snowfall of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
This Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was trapped, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official figures are rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or was it completely removed from the range?
Is there the possibility to order this display in another country?
until when do you sign in?
If the delivery cannot be made in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or returned an article via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
In this way, they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - according to German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to receive Corona vaccines.
He's changed to a company he's been reading about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself in his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Help in the first own campaign
Boron to the pit!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends to the adventure About the grip pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specially for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual files are designed, and now I am writing the entry-level adventure and at the first encounter I stumble over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes will bring a carpentry with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran lake.
The further action is to develop there.
A few miles away from the village, the hero is to enlist a group of Goblins and lure them into a ambush.
I want to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
In case of non-remarking, the Goblins line up the hero in a hollow path and flank to each three left and right bows armed the furwork, while two with spears stop the furwork.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are under, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf will enter with two of his servants and will come to the hero's aid in the struggle.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How appropriate do you deus ex machine of solution 2?
Is the Encounter as an entry into the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later on, so not only is Cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will be sure to take care of many of your ideas and now I also have more confidence in my narrative.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back.
If you can then send the return notes, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

All of a sudden, the crack was there.
I'm just sitting on it
Here the lower part was damaged, i.e. almost the part with storage space.
Is everything then picked up again or just the storage room part?
I'm Genevored by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German sky has diminished more and more, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was canceled to begin on time the F1 pre-reporting.
Although the delayed start and start of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to limit everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, because Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then, in the F1 again, there was a rule dusk at the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that one can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that pavements may change the tires when there were corresponding radio claims on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL both commentators immediately knew that this possibility was possible for disappearing.
I believe that such elementary rules should be known simply when you comment on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the field of rules.
Generally not like the artificial comment style of Roos, but admit that the taste is the thing.
But I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant aberrations that make both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from Ralf Schumacher's (as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD".
Especially the latter brings a lot of disquiet in the comment that he does not seem to take it seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the lead-out Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, how to listen to F1TV because only the German sound track without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two stations also do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and this is a free TV channel.
You have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking station that broadcasts the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Ventilation pumps are excellent for providing an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifters.
This series is available in 3 versions of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run whole plants with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable for connecting several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the fan pump model, but also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (see us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trove, a shell, or something like that.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an Auströmer etc....and it can already start.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher, as the water level and be fitted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a blow valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if one day water would run backwards that runs the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, you should be covered and protected from moisture, as well as other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and are picked up here every day.
If everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little from getting anyone wrong just because it took a little longer.
It would be, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding system...of course there is no Corona here.
Please don't judge as badly, just because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, one likes to be mocked about these services, even if we're saying at the moment... they've been fucking hard.
This is also very different regionally.
If you don't be evil, you stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrests?
Can you order the legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by Blue Origin's new Shepard rocket system by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky Bezos took the freshly decorated astronauts personally after their return to reception.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa astronaut in 1961, flew Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named Blue Origin's rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers paid for their tickets: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket each did Blue Origin not tell you.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard at his work and do everything by himself.
She just flew along like that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would love to return to everything again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers of altitude
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the earth, sometimes with weightlessness, before the reusable object was braked off by large parachutes again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts regard 100 kilometres above Earth as a frontier to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: At first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to drive the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and find the subject quite exciting in itself and also in the laboratory do not bother me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
I have, of course, already informed myself about career prospects before my studies, but at the time I thought that I would like to study and become a doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially with regard to my professional prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) one hears again and again super career chances and the profession is totally sought out, on the other hand one always hears of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I would really be interested:
1) As what do you work at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What did you study / what training did you do?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and I consider in 2022 possibly canceling my studies and making an education as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have experience there, they also like to write :)
Extra Stress Before Holidays & Holiday Weekends
This topic came to my attention last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why I'm going to have a post for that now.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there are those days before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Arise" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday the most common people and farms make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So it was a long 4 day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails, which must be out before the drive-up, order here order there, everything *indistinct* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week" sounds after so much time and that can't be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shorter week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also powerfully generous.
What's this self-esteem about holidays?
What do we have holidays for if we don't like them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent on it.
My question is simple: are we the only ones that are Swiss?
Is that our Reformed Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian hometown - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply go to Ilmenau to the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by baking and babbling with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
However, until the momentous days she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to start now".
NECTON-Bio supports smooth operation of the mouse and spring regeneration.
NECTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
Most of the bird-keeping damage to poultry is due only to dietary errors.
Since the spring consists of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is essential for the formation of an impeccable spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are due to lack of or imbalance in protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be used during the use of NECTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be simply administered via the drinking water or via the soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, still not working
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway station ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and fault parts see photos, function well, the E 95 series is a heavy freight train electricomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal-fired trains in the Silesian network, possibly also from the small-scale company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are able to operate
In 1924 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG to present proposals for an electric locomotive which could transport 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530 tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tachzlag drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens boot mills with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the E 95 operating numbers 01-06.
They all survived World War II and later found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives arrived as repair goods in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The Reichsbahnenfurtungswerk Dessau has established the reliability of all six locomotives.
[4] When a growing demand for heavy freight locomotives was found for the medium German network, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were worked out in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in larger quantities, were first built.
Only when the E 94 was due to the fact that it was not possible to further increase the number of operations, did the E 95 focus on the review.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They arrived at Halle P railway station in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate orbital plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, complex control of locomotives proved problematic.
Thus, it was more often that shooters were stuck in shifting operations.
Then the beemann with hammer and wooden wedge who was on this locomotive had to solve the shooter again during the ride.
Damage to the motor vehicles was more frequent and led to months of failure at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s and no significant expansion of the electric power plant was planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most split engines, so that the E 95 was out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted only one man to occupy electric locomotives, which, due to the above difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's station, would have caused a problem in the train operation.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid 1969, they followed the E 95 01, which was replaced by the E 95 01 on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 has therefore never been used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future E 77 10 museum locomotive as a fixed heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time for the responsible people at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth receiving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external design of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as an inoperative museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Hall P community have been working on the operational design of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time as an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external painting, whereby the transformers were checked and five driving engines were able to operate.
-The locomotives were in operation until 1945 on the Silesian cableway and the branching side tracks, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of use was Silesia at first
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function well, there are optical rework at the locomotive necessary in self-work, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and storage traces.
Yes the F-parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The center beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately faulty produced.
The centre beam does not fit into the intended position.
So I'm getting a new one.
When will they be sent away?
No flattening.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right ones of the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
Main thing they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I have this sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two light injured and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area was caused, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to the report, two residents were brought to the hospital with light smoke poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume intentional fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over the investigation.
She'll arrive much later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs
To uncover fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech Chief Uğur Şahin had not yet made a public statement about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him, told Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he gets a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
In the social media there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often frowned upon by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear can only be difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet an interview circulates with the German wave, in which Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020 as well as the Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am not currently legally allowed to receive the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
In Germany, there was a prioritisation in vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been able to collect the data three times.
Fire in transformer system: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralysed a transfer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transfer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to escape without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening the lights went out in several municipalities at 41,000 people affected by the fire.
Westnett reported that many emergency power units had been in operation on Saturday until the large disturbance could finally be completely fixed on the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the municipalities concerned, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, head of the area of primary technology, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days to complete, as the Westnet-Monteurs were able to start up some lines only on a provisional basis, he explained.
According to company information, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power flows again
The fire started on Friday at 7.15 p.m., according to West Netz's report, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transfer station.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been added gradually from 2.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m. the most recently affected by the failure also had electricity.
More than 80 Western network and partner companies have been in operation.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighboring assistance.
"It is important now that the citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and report to the local fire department houses when help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the installation and operation of emergency power units, the inhabitants of Altenheimen were in particular in focus.
Moreover, according to government information, temporary places of care were set up in schools for those people who were unable to provide themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or who depend on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy these from you and pay in euros?
This is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy .
But I can't put that underlay on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 explanations of this.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them into each other and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be happy to have a feedback.
That's really easier!
Let's do it like that!
Send me the return note by e-mail?
the repair is complete now.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do this now?
Such a low credit I find almost insolent.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic combination: Combined Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined Fabian Rißle and Julian Schmid are printed on the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo once again had to be sued by the outstanding Norwegian rider Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started skiing in the track with great anticipation after the ski jump.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes, we both made new ones and use the version 4.5...
could be that they have heard of problems more often
I bought it directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book it seems to be on it too.
So if I want to open it, the message comes ups!
This document could not be opened.
File might be a bug in your customer service.
As far as I can see it it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection's gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To make the paint order even and clean, clean the components with some soapy water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color to the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 lines.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush even stroke next to the stroke.
Light overlaps of the colour layers later provide a smooth surface.
Avoid quickly wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could go through later.
Metaltones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can become unbeautiful metal scaffolding when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you build them.
The original true look achieves the models through the decals or decals.
From space signs to aircraft, ship names, decorations and car identifications: Decals give the model the last cut.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still well reachable.
An aircraft cockpit can be attached or easily attached before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, pinzettes and toothpicks are when clinging time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay it down for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you wetten their back with water briefly until the carrier paper gets dark through the wets.
Then you slide the picture only a small piece of paper and put the piece to the corresponding position on the model (which you have moistened before).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper off the side.
Attention: Always check whether the image is sitting right before you slide it completely off the paper so that it does not stick, crack or even tear.
Take off excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and I have to unsubscribe and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I read it.
AM Saturday I've already spoken to you.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thanks a lot anyway!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get this back easily?
Child wish treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we have been in child wish treatment for some time, now that it is about billing with the PKV, this suddenly stands across.
The series after:
We had requested the child's wish in advance at the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (successless) attempts, but they did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We applied again for the cost assumption of the PPS and again received 3 further trials.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more trials than promised, logically we calculate the most expensive ones with the PPS) we handed in the invoices at the PPS and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PPS wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first commitment lapse.
The second child wish was a new insurance case.
According to GTC, however, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends if there is no need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts will be made) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out in the promises that the further trials would fall with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed egg yolks) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
All right.
We're not gonna order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customer.
They are happy to pass this on to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was made and now tell me that I have to send back the thing.
I can't believe I'm completely disturbed by the chest of drawers.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the refund has been triggered and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can direct your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise they can't sell him as an office chair.
Regardless, the guarantee of 24 months is valid.
No, it's not possible to get me another kind of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
What is exactly a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's wrong with you?
And what do you think you don't like at all?
Is a very good customer of you, has already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it also reliable now?
Thank you very much.
With kind greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, there's no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus at high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" to policy expert Raphael Bosong.
However, the costs were very high and represented massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bosong the Evangelical Press Service (EPD).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of silence - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Obviously, there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to turn to it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This trend also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot go through when a Member State heads up to do its thing," as is the case with Poland, which does not even allow Frontex the EU Border Guard Agency to access the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bosong: A principle agreement on asylum policy was made difficult, as the line "frontier protection, border protection, border protection" had been strengthened.
A renewed attempt to cross-border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again tried to cross Belarus on Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday at night and returned to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been stoned in the incident near the place of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the report, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried to do so.
The EU calls on Alexander Lukashenko to have attracted them with the prospect of entry into the EU as a ruler in Minsk.
According to the press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed down border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines to bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the people's countries of origin to prevent departure there.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines," said Bosong.
"There the EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough ban days and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also had to take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not concerned that the security apparatus regularly drags thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after disputed Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is said to have done two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver darts suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase when he was supposed to have overtaken regularly.
A second objection was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
After Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in accordance.
On the last lap of Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes, he was still overtaken and had become his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase, in which the Dutch had taken over driving cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thank you for the support

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" series, author Judith Hermann read the Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds on her doorstep.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but I received no e-mail confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question has been answered.
It does not have everyone the time for your clumsy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Mrs #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return ticket.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semit means nothing.
It's like a granddaughter says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of them will not admit their i.
But Colleagues constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just let that complete.
Yeah, well, then you're a little less serious than colleagueah.
Who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply lost.
Because of me, a god has started this whole thing.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And that's how you're an enemy of science and not taking any more seriously like Colleagues.
In order to maintain an optimal field of vision, the lens should be closer to the eye as close as possible.
The specially designed aplanatically-chromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying and colour error-free up to the edge zone.
Lupen is often marked with magnification data.
However, this information applies only to precisely defined conditions, which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to take note of the information in the "Technical data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - even in the case of impact flaps.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection coating.
If the optimum conditions of use are observed - a magnifying lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
For further information, please refer to the instructions for use provided (in German and English).

Yeah, but it was called before.

Tooth sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women search the Christmas trees from
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some kuriosis situations when selling teeth.
Once a man should have returned home without his partner, because both of them could not agree.
Each year he plants well 2000 pieces for that.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some kuriosis situations.
That's what makes pre-Christmas fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I have received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will assess that accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spear.
So both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might sound something like the "Dreher", which is by far not so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network now.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit up to a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these are also available.
However, the other DLan module, which broadcasts the Wifi, no longer reaches the full 500, but the further I unload in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms located from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with fiberglass so much internet speed over the power line goes "lost"?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely elaborate to still move into the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the account
Who would have thought that now would be peace with the giroconts, looks deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm with all kinds of tricks from their customers the increases in fees of the past, the amount of free interest for negative interest continues to decline.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quadrupled for daily money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros with Giro and investment accounts and to 25 000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the initial amount in two stages, initially to EUR 50,000, and now to EUR 25,000.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an exemption of 25,000 euros or less, according to the Verivox website.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: however, there is still a legal dispute with the Consumer Centres, which in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin even got right against this regulation.
The banks are already discussing whether institutions should possibly make provisions - in the case that the upper institutions too explain the negative interest rates in principle and many millions must be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For those who, in 2021 with the "Friends" reunite and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Ferrors, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they treat themselves to a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: a ONE-TIME chip from the bag).
The fact that you are still flying to the hearts of the female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she just has bad luck - and still seeks great love.
And the baby wish has been removed from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really intimidating.
Keep hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than he thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and washed the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight belt contact, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children, had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the winning 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix win, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte wins in the Bweierbob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the target of the bob pilot.
"I figured it out once, I would have to win nine and a half per season, then I could make it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday did he prevent the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed somewhat to the material setting and made a larger advantage on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he went to the British Brad Hall.
==References====External links==
"We have gone more risky today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd win in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who drove for Stuttgart, arrived after second place this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in the first race in eighth place after fourth place.
"If I knew what else he'd do, I'd do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season with the women on her home track.
After it was only for the fourth place in the Monobob on the day before, she raced for the World Cup on Sunday at the German triple success with Shieber Deborah Levi.
With Germany's fastest Sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, two were born two in BRC Thuringia.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium in this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me along.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times were okay today," said Burghardt and stressed: "It is not just moving, but there is a lot to do around."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not quite error-free rides, but said, "It goes in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I have not just received it and therefore cannot redeem it, which is why I have at last asked for it.
Through Corona last year I had quite different problems and never had time for them.
And now his name was gone, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No only when I tip on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong goods.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, just this week, only until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls
I've got some things I just want to write and maybe it's going to be - or other people, too...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog emama - apart from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has recovered a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him, we've cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him to take a shower (because hand is in the dressing room.
He is cooled up above and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just had a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he's in his pillow lid and he's relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework that we of course split up.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and ready.
Not good, but I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I'll have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what happens then is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the holiday starts.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these spiritual clues, because otherwise I'll take this down.
Somehow I feel guilty and chaotic, but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you do it?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't put that in words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has some to do with mental loads of women, and that's why I thought I'd probably find suffering comrades here...
I certainly wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and tablebone has print.
At the first delivery, the colour was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to change the table now, will I get a different color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times, by the way.
But she was not confirmed.
Once something completely different: I found in school at the time that many religious teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian, and I always believed in it somehow.
How are you doing?
You may also be able to tell about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, will help you to want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
True Culture or something?
Hope you have a question to ask is not too private.
Can't change it or not?I like to write English that I understand well too
It's been a long time, then I'd miss it.
It's okay, thank you.
I expect to receive feedback in good time by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please try to find help with the movie
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First of all, modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) is not certain.
Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform like those of the soldiers out of the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross, and an act is created.
The Antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live himself I mean.
I believe the transition is also the burial site of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers fight each other.
If that's what I'm saying to you, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our kid slept on his stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child does much more than you think.
Make sure everything's right around here, no cucumbers, more often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ah, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but they've always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he's asleep.
Does it turn its head aside?
Can it set itself up from the belly?
Or is it with the face ahead Directly in the mattress?
You can deduce if everything's okay.
We've all grown up and when my husband came to the world, it was a walk and would have to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stammkunde" with you and have already bought many products
But then why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote a letter yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far I haven't heard back.
It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To make it clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the policy of this station is now under control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big bedding tour at the same time.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet channel.
Quote Arno: You want to be "no running hooker".
What is it now?
A 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may, of course, continue to insult the people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How are you supposed to find it all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for a Rueck call, as my supplied wooden table was defective.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought the power supply on my own was enough to run.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plug-in power supply.
Then I expanded the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Do you want ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.

No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold parts.
And whatever else you need on everyday items, thanks to practical access to the individually configurable interior, the photo equipment is well organized and portable.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) the series is presented in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has spelled out in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still provide quick access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid valve, which can be locked with the MagLitch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal clasp hook in the clasp with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has devised various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stablely destroyed, into which the closure hook can be cut.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Claps and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliably without touching the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to wander through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday fitness of the backpack: because if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus store both of them separately without problems - and access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left side of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear belts help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email of their support.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp has been delivered to me than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent back.
And that the past year went a different way than I thought I could not imagine and just couldn't redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotary brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety during braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotary brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production programme is drawn up, which is based on the properties of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tinted discs thus manufactured ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, the openings created increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, with the cuttings improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake valves.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car by their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing cracks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" by '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the country's fastest growing and thriving cities.
Areas were set up, tents opened, and Saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the country's wealth.
For many people it was called: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankratt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll look for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You're gonna have to outsmart your pioneer colleagues so you don't have to go to jail with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose simultaneously your actions, have to budget with your resources and create a Tableau that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California became the official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will be secretly and at the same time choose a location on the playing field where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning guns.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the rewarder turns to a new location and thus changes the actions available.
This continues until the purchaser has moved five times, so each location has covered up once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an assault of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough guns and the bandits are superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are No Tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have looked at it immediately.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Becoming Our Children tyrants" (2008), he triggered a heated educational debate.
The former patient:those entitled to education are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible people must never, never, ever, go about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for his development and to make the framework as big for the child as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the loss of the test obligation for triple vaccines
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a federal departure from the testing obligation for triple vaccines.
"We countries need clarity quickly, whether and from when the test requirement can be met three times for vaccination," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, "picture on Sunday".
The withdrawal of 2G plus for triple vaccines was "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional impancent," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said "that he will make a proposal for this on next Tuesday at the Health Minister's Conference".
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I best do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer shop through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most common is to hear noises/smooths, more rarely to see images and the rarest to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: Imperial cuts are the operations associated with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided for the protection of the child up to the abduction.
Previous awareness episodes should be mentioned in the anesthesia pretrial.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) involve a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment by me describes although Awareness correctly, but had no** u/Nitemarex **by definition.
Have read her comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again whether they will at least take back the defective chair.
Then we sell the second chair privately.
We lose a lot of money too.
I already sent you an e-mail that you did not answer.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice is that the goods are delivered up to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not gonna call you?
I had a question formulated
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97-year-old
He has been a theatre critic and an engineer.
Later he wrote a monumental theater story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, pressurized: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I've testified to my life's thanks."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standard wooden pallets, which are used mainly as cargo carriers in the European area.
You are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics from Austria in 2020, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was well 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria is not collected

Roasted Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect Gulasch.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook to New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I get that.
IIt is a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail of the refund on 18.01.
But until today, the money has not been received from me.
Please check.
Where there are still Christmas Bread in the Lübeck room
For many people, Gans or Ente is one of the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Now the time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas bread in the Lübeck room.
The "Drive" of a tube finish contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand, and on the other hand, the disintegration of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and distortion.
On top of that, it has already been suggested that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even make a power reserve available when it goes out loud and loud.
With POWER LEVEL regulators, the whole potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphones can also be used as a line output.
The appropriate signal is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an impressive "acoustic" sound impression yourself when using a headphones or when shooting directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 foot key, you can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "stop" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for the live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step into the future!
But had seen it with others like that.
Is there then a way to send the lamp back?
Because she hangs over a dining table too low?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chestnut?
Do we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs.
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need then are a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know whether screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the revitalisation of the international nuclear agreement are progressing according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are in short supply to some on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This was a "positive and important development" because initially there was no agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the relaunch of the agreement had been continued after just a week's interruption.
Negotiators of Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also involved in Vienna, but only indirectly in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now State with the highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was located at the Corona-Incidence on Sunday above the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had last always shown the highest national incidence, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths associated with infection were reported within one day of 2242.
200 severe Covid-19 patients were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
Message delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and hardly come after them with the identification of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery takes place only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it on the mail, that was it?
I don't have to click/give/fill anything further?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro Return fee is a frenzy in my eyes.
It is time for change
###Starting day, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
- What's the mail for?
Once you look at the activity in the past months of MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not always.
We came into a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
What's the problem?
Yeah, what's it all about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, as some things have passed here and as we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has been that many people here still have Bock on the MBundestag.
# What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundestag who wants to keep them alive.
The incitement came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, simply, sharp crowd.
After some writing and writing, several people from the community have found themselves who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders must be modified / adjusted / removed?
* How should we proceed in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a lot, but what's not bad is what we have the discord at the end.
If you want and have time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide on the future.
I ordered you a lampshade to deliver it.
Now I see that the article is too big/clobish for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there also in excess, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet is picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to let it go now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has once lived vegetarian for a while, now it is very rare to eat meat.
I myself was also a few years ago vegetarian.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And while I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end I also support animal torture.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that on their side dismay came up, she then defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and one reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without that one would put it on.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not detach from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date, on which #PRS_ORG# my return does not pick up on the spot.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, it can't be changed either.
Can I have an alternative pick-up date, please?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly back.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue equipped: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Town Hall handed over a fee of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in service since November 2020 was EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The machine car is used by the divers' fork Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they carry out water and ice-rescue tasks as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein you can count on increasing efforts: the tree of the hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought myself a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations but have synchronized, removed and the app newly loaded NOT has worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and is hoping for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment during the order process?

Thank you for putting yourself here for the whole thing, I also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we were also arms carriers in the executive, I don't want to go further!
I always find the question of right and left very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the state servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and weaponry attracting people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course deal with the living reality is also clear, because, of course, in addition to the average white, many Germans with migrant backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and therefore I do not mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because they exist in the executive rather less than at all but quite normal men and women whom you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also to these people and I have to leave because in doubt they will save your life or put it in for you.
But even if my experience sounds strange for the first time after a conservative attitude, these marginal groups are proud of Germany and feel rather less absorbed by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to be committed to them or if it means they have to be right, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me as well.
Of course, policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign use often start to pause due to negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also true that there may be a lot of right contemporaries who are engaged in a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I think that is a good fight and is also countered by political education and education!
Germany is so embroiled internationally and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have proper racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany.
I always think you're just a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wood piece are two deep sticks that were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary through child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure time), but my whole life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it picks up me and I clean up and clean up.
But it's actually never 'that someone could come to visit spontaneously'.
My husband is not (sorry) better either, but it bothers me somewhere but mostly household simply loses against work and unemployment.
The kitchen is still regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get better with a child?
We don't have any work yet, and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much as long as no visit comes and e.g. there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay slutty?
Look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I see more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have thought for a long time to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or avoidable) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
That means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have a relaxed conversation and I've been told more often that I work inextricably (which I think is already better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in the search for advice or family help.
However, I do not know whether the real day of work really is the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there's something to be bothered about in my code ("still the easiest things to deal with") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues to help ("I should really know for myself how to do it"/"I'll keep him with my stupid questions from work"/"who really has to think of me as being inferior" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it instead.
Did you get the sofa back yet?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean, give it back?
When I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be your #PRS_ORG# authenticated this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) taken with the feed divides the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastro-intestinal tract and then builds up its own protein substances, which it also needs to form spring.
The feathering of the nestling and the feathering of the muttering bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as there may be other disorders in the breeding course.
Following this curative administration of NECTON-Bio, it was appropriate to return to the daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral compound preparation).

1 g of NECTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/weighing food as the bird consumes daily and to switch water/feed daily.
A coated spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON-Bio.
In case of severe spring damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the start until the re-formation approach is visible.
After that, the normal dose is reached until the rejuvenation of the spring is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
I'm sorry, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranties in Germany are 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Have you received this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal staff member in reply to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have this problem.
A walnut tree is to be liked on our property.
So, the application for a trap to the community was made.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
However, the statutes explicitly state the walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging they use for it.
I have not received any message
Well, then I still have one sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is whether I can pay in euros and deliver the ceiling to Germany.
Can you check it out?
Eilberichtung: Heavy traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a major road accident occurred on St. 2179 between the self-Nord and Plößberg junction.
As the police's press alarm announces (14:03 hrs), a car has come into counter-trafficking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, understand.
Well, then thank you so much again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas on further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is, unfortunately, moderately good, because my dear head is just reflecting on everything you can think about.
Before I get out here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who know my situation somehow - so of you.
I'm doing the Ref as a cross-integer right now.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (to at least stay a little anonymous, I don't call anything more precise here).
But all of this was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Someday I landed at the Teaching Office and was sure that it is - even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job offers".
And it's only six months away.
I have always decided to go ahead and at least finish the Ref, after which I can still turn around.
But I am absolutely finished right now.
I've had so little free time for the last month that I've completely exhausted.
Now is a vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend and my holiday evening.
I was free there.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that even bother me.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside the Ref also runs well as far as the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body has before it completely closes - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - just when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, to take my time off if I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but paid appropriately for it and worked together in a team that worked out and not as a single fighter like this is the most time of the case.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived in the same place in a year as now and have been dissatisfied.
You see, it's all kind of messy, but maybe you've come out of this situation as outsider advice or ideas, which I'm completely done crying at the smallest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time already.
Thank you for reading and apologies for the weeping undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" cutting, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multistage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only spew.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 has once again led to a performance push of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists will find a maximum sound range here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of game dynamics and string stroke as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, in particular, the end stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behaviour, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points of Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA stops.
Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points of Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually spaceable and foldable Velcro components it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any kind of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflector cameras.
Which ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible mounting would be a DSLR camera with an engaged lens, two to three alternate lenses and a flashing.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store plenty of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava currents on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of Tehuya volcano in 1585 was 84 days longer than the longest on the Atlantic island in front of the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists have not ventured to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage at million height
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the more than 1,000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast by cold lava.
It was particularly affected by the huge banana growing, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crushing tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-building "society treaty of natural peoples", can be eluded and refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the child of Christ
It was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days to the consecration.
Previously on Nikolaustag presents were presented in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, a bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into her window one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom popular in Germany emerged to fill the boots with gifts especially for the children.
Protestants met this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they are opposed to the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ child from Nikolaus and thus established a new tradition line.
The focus of the consecration thus shifted to the evening of the holy night.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only annoys the least that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to Martin’s use of Martinsingen and Martin’s migration, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desirable luxury watches all that the heart desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift shifted to holy evening.
However, in all Christianly influenced countries, a happy dresser is in charge of the question who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether the child of Christ appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, who has been assigned some peculiarities over time.
These include, for example, his white rust bar, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian bar of the historical figure, his sled, which is drawn from reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who must have led them the way to the Child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes fabled beings bring gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that draw their sleds as troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police are shooting suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me that callers reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots had fallen and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police didn't leave a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously in every beet, garden or stony garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored to the ground with 2 ground spears.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting duration max. 10 h
- The robust plastic version can be used all year round in the outside area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that give inner color.
Quite harmless, on the other hand, »Smart Stone«: The sun alone makes this solar light look fascinating – in white or colored light (in six different colours).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a natural-shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself day by day.
Its organic rounds fit in any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stonebed.
He is also well placed in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to claim himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preliminary work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require any power supply or batteries.
Place the "lightstone" in a place that is always sunny in the daytime.
Two ground spears provided provide firm hold when needed.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module conceals »Smart Stone« discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of a break-in dusk, "Smart Stone" starts to shine automatically; in which color you decide yourself: You can choose the same six attractive light colours – in addition to daylight white.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery load level is reduced to a specified minimum or it is bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins the next day from the front.
I've done that several times already. It doesn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to continue with you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, I'm not going to order it out of principle.
If you think about it differently, you'll let me know.
Otherwise this was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

Pill problems
Hello, dear lady people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year I actually reddit my first post.
To my problem: I started taking pills about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to keep it back, because I have to take enough medicines because of chronic diseases that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had got my last two-year break from 0 to 100 explosion-like pimples and these everywhere.
So far as it was so superficial, but I was pretty upset about this and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this.
Perfume free and without candies is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, my wife's doctor didn't take me so seriously and my skin doctor's appointment is still here.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel through!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertary severe neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale knee joint and acne theme.
I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and depended on down sugar, milk and low meat mixture food, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is just the worm in there, but if you like me have the construction site everywhere, you'd rather not go looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had all her colleague Semina o. a.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concerns.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and there was all of a sudden gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
but there is it generally in large
because it is available in black size

110-kV ground cable is being rebuilt in 2022
The authorisation for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The planning decision of the government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The earth cable will connect the Tann transformer in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the free line.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue payment number:#PRS_ORG# with the send number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the label "Not possible delivery".
All three other packages have arrived so that a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a dresser made of glass and the entire sides are burst, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the dresser can't be picked up because nobody can get into my apartment.
Thanks for the message
but why only EUR 20?

No, it is for all the books, so the request at #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem
Ref: Plan lessons (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I still have big problems to plan my education in science for time.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so that in principle I can only use the tablet, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy b/w for free at school (which is annoying).
I just need a very long time at the moment to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic geofactors and with me is actually every hour.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I also do not want to invest excessive time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go out of the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the worksheets are also used.
Maybe I can get a professor of physics to work with the book for a while.
I'd really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would be happy to do the return as soon as possible for the first time.
Trade fears about the 2G regulation around the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or cured may still be allowed.
Trade considers this to be unnecessary and lamented sales disruptions.
A possible solution is also available.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations destroy retail the important Christmas business.
In the case of transactions with articles of non-daily need, sales breaks were to be complained, criticised HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey conducted by HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed negatively the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Good it runs only in retail food and online.
The Federation called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter," said the chief manager.
"2G when shopping doesn't bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staff use.
The agreement had to be granted on a national basis.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once for 2G (impaired or cured) and would have access to all shops with the received tape on that day.
In addition, sampling should be sufficient in retail, as in public transport at the level of the 3G rules (spoiled, healed or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
At last, the frequencies were around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, the turnover was around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high level of personnel and administrative effort, the Center is being tried to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called tape solution, in which "the visitors can, for example, enter their 2G card at a central location in the center once and then – equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel – enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratcher and on the frame is also an error that was tried with a yellow filler to be clogged.
That doesn't look so good.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and glued it back.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities provides for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light creates a very light stream with a soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporting situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both at the film set or at the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables the remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-access places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness adjustment in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery)
User Storage The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, one of the memory keys is simply loaded and finished by pressing for a longer period.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when the lamp is switched off, so that the known situation will be restored when new ones are switched on - very convenient for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check in front of the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery above the display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp with electricity above the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for mounting, so you can directly access your photo stand.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of fixators on both sides.
It was observed that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a nail joint is included in the delivery.
This is a great thing that is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
Shame I have received and it is too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of seglosen Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga track.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the frustration of a season start of the soul within a good hour and won furios with 5:2. "It is madness what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and said a "Pauscal praise, to each one who was with them".
At first it looked like a new shocker for the Frankfurters now ranked nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players have then returned and demonstrated a fantastic performance," says Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Also defenseman Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the scene for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morals of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a look at the result especially for the viewers.
That was the party we were trying to throw out today.
But Glasner wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but is also well positioned in terms of the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now you want to "go on step by step and keep modest" and "put it through at this level until the turn of the year".
The next game is on the program at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 h, Sky) in the course of the English week on Wednesday.
Gradually, I get the e-mail that comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me again directly or do I have to wait until the money has been returned and the order is returned again?
I would then regret to say that I will not be ordering again because it has been going on for a long time.
Have you ever been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Handball women dampers in front of quarter finals against Spain
After humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women compared with hanging heads and empty looks from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup's main round, the DHB election at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers collected a severe defeat and now in the quarter final it must be against the host Spain.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Federal Trainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the ladies (10:0).
I'm sorry we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game that we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semifinals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup Seconds next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was the back-up player Alina Grijzeels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," Xenia Smits cleared back space player and demanded, "We need to look forward quickly."
From front to back not at height
In contrast to the previous five tournament games, the German team with the Anpfiff was not on the high level.
Mistakes and technical faults in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 recovery after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijzeels successfully completed a quick counter-return.
However, the initial ignition was not expected.
The German women could hardly stand up to the aggressive cover of the Danes - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
So the game had been played early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, to the point where back-up player Mia Zschocke saw red too little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
But in the quarter final, it can be played back.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and until the break at least on five goals.
The only quiet hope of a catch-up hunt after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greenlanders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to pick up at a performance increase and went as a clear loser from the parquet.

The title is available, I am working as an vaccine in mobile vaccination teams where (until now only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, it will then go on in some vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, this deals with vaccination.").
In my area of work, the information for vaccination, indication (person is entitled to vaccination according to Corona vaccination regulations and no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation and, where appropriate, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never done so).
The vaccination itself is delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have them, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but who cannot carry out vaccinations (should?), so that I also perform most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler"?
This dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, has been used in the BR television program "We in Bavaria" for intense thought.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unspeakable by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, "everything has to go fast."
That, the people of the TV hostess heard that was completely wrong.
On what the man from Amberg announced the solution, and thus probably also in many upper pavilions he caused astonishment.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewing Bavarian television experts for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical upper part, derived somehow from the rather familiar word "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also in some that have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
It always comes after the confirmation the following error message: opens - someting wont wrong - try again later.
I re-started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Selection of tyres on the racing bike - really so armory?
This morning I woke up full of action because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour in the next week.
Said, done and I drove off with my bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurked.
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud zing and my back tire didn't want to take part in the rest of the track at all.
Because of the day of the week, I had no real way to get a replacement coat and a spare hose, I had to turn around with a little bit of a bad mood and take the first train home.
Wasn't quite so bad then, maybe it's better if I do it again before the bike tour with the tire change.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely sorry for this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike up to 2 p.m. were demolished!) and who had already called it a suboptimal because he had been driving with them for more years.
But if I think that I still have to make a tyre change when driving to 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad at this :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who surprised me, why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unflatterable.
Now, of course, this sounds very tempting.
But are these really so uncupable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tips now just to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I think I have 25x622 at the moment on the race bike.
Although there are also (apparently?) the Marathon Plus tires, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend me to other tires on a racing bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and love greetings!
Car slides against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was rallied on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained cause against a Middle Island and then on the counterroads, as the police told him.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man was stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were severely injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.
yes we have deleted all books all bony authoritized and loaded new books

After the release of our new high end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would be born again.
SOLO 15 is the new Sprinkling and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable designed foot is directly included in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people where the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but must be achieved by an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is remarkably grown up and for its size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal's SOLO 15 was matched with a slight rise in the pitch.
This is generally used in wide strips in order to optimize the too high frequencies significantly increasing bundled.
The SOLO 15 convinces exactly on the hearing spot with a very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone range can be reduced slightly to the outside and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the sound source, the placement of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo stretch is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution capacity and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended that you start thinking about the final optics of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, you need to adjust the lowering of the speaker accordingly, as the veneer again carries material.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the appropriate position in order to be able to perform the cable without any problems there.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used in a short time.
On the reverse side, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these the back wall, the lid, the front and the ground are glued up.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the material strength if they are needed, for example, if they are to be used on finished loads from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
After that all the plates of the foot, so the two sides, as well as the front follow.
By means of a suitable circular saw or a wood driller, the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall are facilitated.
Then you use a round cutter to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the footplate is glued firmly with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-drilling (2,5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connector terminal.
After cleaning the housing of wood dust (sew / blow out), start laying the cable.
The 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall is the easiest way to do this.
You push the entire and uncut cable piece for piece through the 8 mm bore into the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the housing you can lead the cable to the speaker opening and make it easy to hang out there.
The frequency path is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency folds, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency path is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bassREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot adhesives onto the opening and lock them like this.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follow the damping according to description.
Then the B 100-6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I give up an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> at last we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it is still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will begin about 0:30.
If you are already cold drinks, plan good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
