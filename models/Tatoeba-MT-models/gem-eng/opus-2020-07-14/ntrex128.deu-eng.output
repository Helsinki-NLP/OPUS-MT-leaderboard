Members of the Wales National Assembly fear confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament) leaves dismay.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament" (Welsh Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions are afraid to become the target of the joke.
One Labour Party member said that his group was concerned because the name “Twp” and “Pwp” is rhyming. ”
For non-Walisian readers: in Welsh, twp stands for 'deaf' and 'pwp' for 'Aa'.
A National Assembly member of Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was not happy and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is spoken similar to the letter u in Yorkshire spoken English.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, with the members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which provided broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the "Welsh Parliament Members" (Walish Members) or "WMPs" preferred the largest support at a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but it could be a problem to call for a consensus for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is to present a draft law within weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of National Assembly members and the design of the Committee system.
In their debate on the law, the members of the National Assembly can finally vote on their names.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to Northern Macedonia.
The referendum was set to settle a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the same name Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised in the Greek territory and has repeatedly spoken against its admission to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of names, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO is to be changed.
The bells of St. Martin's silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people with whom I spoke said that in the past there was a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
"Today there are both no more."
He said that the bar's disappearance was understandable.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves."
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will "be at the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums in which people live who do not support the remaining resorts.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be whites," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
In the 1930s, the original white Methodist community was removed.
A black congregation that kept its worship nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to stop or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang bells in July used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was 18 years ago changed to the bigger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, who were partly attracted by the lay leaders of the Church and partly by the bishops' diocese.
In July, the local councillor – the administrative body of the municipality consisting of lay leaders – expressed written reservations to the Diocese that the Diocese would try to pass the costs on to the local council, although he had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some parishioners complain of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured in California 13-year-olds diving to Lobster
In California on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark officially attacked a 13-year-old boy diving to Lobster.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the station KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled with several others to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was happy to have a praiser, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When hammel arrived at the boy's house, he found that his entire collarbone had been torn apart.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Officials for investigation and security reasons blocked access for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan for the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's tackles cosmetic departments attractive to department stores that are occupied with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and debenhams.
As part of a large-scale advance on the 2.8 billion pounds of British cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods are declining, the larger cosmetics departments are being tested in eleven branches across the country. If they are successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for possibilities to use other loading areas used for television sets, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, for the first time, the scope of its cosmetic offering doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket performs a relaunch of its “Boutique” make-up series, so that most of the products are vegan friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfumer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's financial sales outlets. The first sales point was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second one will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to make customers visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has established a number of outlets since buying the chains Argos and Habitat two years ago in hundreds of branches of Argos sales outlets and also in a number of Habitat sales outlets, which has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but ended after an argument about the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch-wide pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan insofar as an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Because of the seductive environment and the convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that questions the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones "wrong" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth 11 million pounds
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “wrong” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truely.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
The "This Morning" mother, 37, announced her withdrawal from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons” Den” Star Peter Jones by her very short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on their own new connecting contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "wrong" when the "Golden Girl" of television agreed at a tight meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to be unable to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessories brand Truly, due to their new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure its future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw was completely surprising for all concerned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
A warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold in the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, which is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost millions due to high investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the launch of the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, came in March as chairman.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of the ITV broadcast 'I'm A Celebrity'.
A Jones, a nearby source, said last night: "We are not commenting on his business affairs."
Hard words 'and then we fell in love'
He was amazed at the criticism he had of the news media for a comment some would consider to be 'non-principal' and expected for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said following a news moderator's voice:
'I gave up nothing.'
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore was praised by Trump in June as a major step towards North Korea's denuklarization.
However, the negotiations on denukularisation have gone down to the ground.
Over three months after the Singapore Summit in June, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from around the world at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "corresponding reaction" to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted that the US was committed to sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rallying speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remnants of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing out the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes ruin an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international support, so that is a bit difficult," said summation.
While Save the Children compiles a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While in Aceh Tsunami shelters were built, these on other shores are not an everyday sight.
The apparently missing tsunamisirene in Palu despite a warning entered into force has probably contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, which will be re-electing next year, suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to continued tensions of confession in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes and homes, when gangs from Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with Macheten, arrow and bow as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge achieves deep balancing against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford-Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 at a distance of about 27 meters from the gate of Chelsea.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot him towards the back.
The shot sailed high above the penitentiary and operated into the right upper corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for me.”, Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just accepted the shot."
Chelsea was hit in the 25th minute by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard in the mid-term at 1:0.
The blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Afterwards he shot a good steep pass, so that Hazard got into the penitentiary.
Hazard left the defender behind and closed the net with a left-hand shot at Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in the stadium San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is opposite the UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of Tsunamis in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the Civil Protection Authority announced on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been collapsed by the earthquake of the strength 7.5th of Friday, which had triggered up to six meters high waves, reported the official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed
After the discovery of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55. A 32-year-old was arrested for suspected murder.
The police are asking the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early phase, but I would ask everyone who stopped near John Street in Birkenhead and saw something suspicious or heard to contact us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken up something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who believe the woman has arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are being conducted, and the police told us that they are in the process of informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats again and again, 'that is so terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vehicles inside the lock and another vehicle in front of the lock.
There were several police officers inside the lock-down that monitored the housing block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call the number 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to the protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell Stadium before Parliament is the newest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England, reminiscent of the Taliban, by his fanatical puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as 'poorness' and 'try to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's statue was aimed at the palace of Westminster.
The picture tower in the English Civil Wars was neither arranged nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that, in the opinion of many, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of ongoing history debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
Its services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killer pigs bite Chinese farmers to death
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was called, was found dead with a blood-soaked artery near a pig stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
According to reports, he arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig stable was open.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on the nose.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo pig had killed the farmers.
"The legs of my cousins were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the surname "Wu" was called, was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Photos of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that pigs had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police were collecting evidence at the crime scene.
According to Yuan's family and the market authorities, reports of compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilor pig caught a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife was able to hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "supplier".
“They’re just playful.
They like to settle and are very curious... they're not ready to hurt someone.
You only have to treat them with the right level of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way through the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods causing rains in North Mexico and the South West of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 p.m. East Coast Time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a hurricane of category 1, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a trough begins to form, moving towards the west coast of the United States. On Monday, when Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, high tropical moisture is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rainfall in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will generate strong rainfalls in the South West due to interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous floods, flooding in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity results in precipitation rates from almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall are expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of floods of floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Faced with the threat of tropical rainfall, walking on foot in the desert is strongly discouraged.
Strong rainfall can result in canyons becoming raging currents, and thunderstorms bring local wind buoys as well as wind, which leads to dust.
The approaching trough brings local strong rain in parts of the southern California coast.
The total impact of a centimetre is possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris drifting in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday strong rain spreads to the Four Corners region and lasts Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the center and east of the USA, a warm beginning of October is expected with wide-ranging temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million spectators on Thursday saw the captivating statements by the Board of Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. On Friday TV stations interrupted their regular program due to a last minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, harassed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average audience numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the audience in a play-off football game or in the Oscar rental.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose supposed moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million spectators of the whole day's hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reportedly had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by cameras from CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protesting him in the elevator on his way to a hearing of the Judicial Committee was strongly indignant with words.
He stood for minutes with a reduced view while he was being trained. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and supplemented it before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks were broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee on the Forwarding of the nomination of Kavanaughs was to vote to the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only on condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, demanded to investigate the allegations against the candidate in the next week.
Flake was convinced partly by discussions with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Counts and then various senators Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance because it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation of the allegations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for withdrawal from the European Union to use Britain's future for political purposes and to undermine the national interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May is joining the Conservative Party Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her on the headlines of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson exacerbated his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal that envisages the mutual entry of tariffs through Great Britain and the EU as "all-round absurd".
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect at Louisiana State University (LSU) in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested by Baton Rouge's police.
The authority published video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police secured glasses at the crime scene and said that Simpson's DNA glasses had been found.
After a poll of Simpsons, the police reported that he had faced the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the security deposit has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coronaner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a bullet wound on the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU-Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for "their care and their quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach said Will Wade the team was "deeply shaken" over Waydes' death and "stand under shock".
"Before such a thing you're always afraid," said Wade.
The volcano spits ashes on Mexico City.
From the volcano Popocatepetl cast out the southern quarter of the Mexican capital has reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of scramble and shock.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in quarters of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists discovered that since September 2017 an earthquake of 7,1 Central Mexiko had rocked, increased activity on the vulcano located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the preparedness police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro separatists, held back by the emergency police, threw eggs into the dark clouds of dust in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, the police used their batons to control the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups were 'no forgetfulness, no forgiveness', while they were opposed to Unionists calling 'Long live Spain'.
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The electorate had opted for independence with an overwhelming majority, although the vote was low, since the opponents of the division boycotted most of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent voting in violent clashes in front of the polls.
Per-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in protesting the separatists, said he saw the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we have experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining the momentum. Many of their most famous leaders are either in the exile imposed themselves or in detention where they are waiting for their proceedings because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been curtailed by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tighter," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after home was framed by car
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been hit by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot on the car with a crossbow.
Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first gate for Livingston won the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hit turned out to be a decisive factor in the ability of Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without going out and will face the Hearts, which are eight points behind them next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his victory series in the Division to six games, that is, Chief Trainer Holt has not been defeated since his takeover of Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for playful guests
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the hit, as its directness put the Rangers before the most diverse problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but got slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was shot here to meet Craig Halkett's head shot past the gate.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate was established.
The Rangers gave a free shot, and Livingston offered a chance to take Menga to the same position, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson shot Menga. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penitentiary.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unpalatable.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced him to fight.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers Gatekeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow dragged the ball out of another standard situation from Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly entered Livingston's penal area and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two demanded crimes – one of Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one for hand play – were refused.
"Phoenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and have exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Their way of playing and their team has hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt is highly commended for the way in which he has raised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were holding onto Trab during the entire game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as they were occasionally under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was inadequate – only once could they penetrate the team of hosts – and this is something like a wake-up call for the rangers that are located in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the government chiefs of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for preventing a 25,000-person crowd from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdokan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also heard. They condemned Erdogan's policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and begrudging by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bikers die when colliding with the car
In a car crash, a cyclist died in London.
The collision took place at about 10:15 a.m., British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the sanitizer took care of the man, who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident another cyclist was killed in an accident with a driver's escape on Childreners Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and to inform his next relatives.
Road barriers and reroutings for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in unrest
According to Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison for men in unrest.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. in HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire, and still persisted.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were added to end the unrest involving eight inmates and confined to one wing.
Officials were treated on site for minor injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to repair an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police are being handed over and possibly spend longer behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, security officers were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floods (driving areas may benefit)
It rarely occurs that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is what will probably happen at the beginning of next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa pass over the southwest marked by deserts and bring the risk of floods of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest marked by deserts, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be isolated up to a total of 10 centimeters.
For those who are not at risk of floods, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain will probably be useful in part, as there are currently droughts in the South West.
According to U. S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First of all, the Hurricane path means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the hurricane will move north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit the colder water and thus weaken.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will meet in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, precipitation amounts from 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible," said weather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will cross Mexico in a northerly direction, on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, reach the Arizona border and then move up to the south of Utah until the late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
"The main danger is expected in connection with Rosa or her remains of very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the deserted southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of this rainfall, life-threatening floods and floods are expected in the desert and in water-driving debris as well as in mountainous areas of Erdrutsche.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the discovery of a 16-year-old in Somerset, three boys were arrested in their teens and a 20-year-old man under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teen was injured on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is "stable".
According to the police from Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered 'unity, anger' of the Democrats.
"A voice for judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the entire process of nomination, Kavanaugh suffered 'unity, anger' of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh announced on Thursday before the Congress and dismissed the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford, who had sexually harassed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also announced her accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in the service of the general public," he said the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electorate's participation in the intermediate elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not joining, but in reality I'm starting," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission "resistance and block".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate on Friday at the latest, said a high team member of the GOP leadership against CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victims increase
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swam away as a result of a severe earthquake and a tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi huge waves hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people came together on Friday at a party on the beach of the city of Palu, when at the time of the dawn of darkness, waves hit the beach up to six meters high and many people burst into death and destroyed everything that stood their way.
The Tsunami had preceded an earthquake of strength 7.5.
"When yesterday the threat arose from the tsunami, people still went on the beach and didn't run off immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian National Civil Protection Agency BNP at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he brought swimming cars, tree trunks and houses, he met everything on land," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had passed over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people were climbing trees on the run from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was located in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Authority of BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) stated in a statement that during the massive earthquake of Friday, energy had matched the 200-disciplinary energy of the nuclear bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were collapsed.
According to his report, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of destroyed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage along the coast could have been 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralysed by Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse', said the statement.
On Saturday, the authority was often criticized for not having informed that a Tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves met according to official information at the time of the warning.
In social media published amateur photographs show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns with calls the people on the street under him before the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall forces on the shore and swims buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a massive power failure that interrupted communication around Palu and made the authorities more difficult to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo aircraft with the support of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other vital goods.
The city airport remains closed until October and has only been reopened for relief measures.
A visit of President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was scheduled for Sunday.
The number of tsunami sacrifices has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the employees in tent accommodation in the courtyard of their office are safe, but, according to Dosebas, they passed scenes of destruction on the way.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began to do the hard job of launching disaster relief, some noted that specialized foreign workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
"At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'When the government says 'okay, this is a national disaster', we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.'
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members hoped for this on one of the wonders that shed light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater canal.
On Sunday, rescue forces freed a woman who had been stuck under debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subando, coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the Asian games that had ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Other of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa-Hotel were his students, as Mandadi added.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told us how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa-Hotel among the paraglidings made the round, whatsApp news despaired of the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, instead of blue ticks, only led to grey question marks.
"I think that means that the news was not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling a ATM in Newport on the Life
According to a Newport Police Press Release, Newport’s staff of Brink’s filling up a ATM machine stole $26,750 in Newport on the Levee Diebe on Friday morning.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man rang behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money that was destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the crime scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When announcing the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change presupposes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
It is a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not just a shortcut to his current professional name, but it has a religious significance for West in its own words.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means “the only one”, only “Ye” became – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West earlier, has also written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO pledged not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population while the 50th anniversary of the bloody reprisals against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square and killed 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were establishing themselves in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led young criminal gangs.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on AI announcements of various areas of the US government, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are so much further behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next great AI success would be achieved in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-placed American Othello player. Later, he was the leading executive at Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised previous US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to read words, researchers in the US often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China is taking away the leading academics, but the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years set up universities to work at AI.
According to Read's opinion, a changed US immigration policy could also be conducive to the AI efforts of the US.
"I think that Greencards should be offered automatically in the area of AI," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lese words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations awarded money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense set up the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where partners from industry and science should be involved. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced the investment of USD 2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than 100 million US dollars annually in AI research.
In the meantime, US laws on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
The people of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to 'North Macedonia', which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim is raised in the Greek territory. Greece has therefore introduced a veto against the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign is in doubt that the electoral participation reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was, 'Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the change in name, of which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO, is worth the price.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, since it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of this House have said that they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13.00.
The vote was, however, only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in the referendum on the change of country name, which Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and to the European Union on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
In his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian channel Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be successful, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since its takeover of power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton defense to achieve goal
On Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defenses at the 2:0 win of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hits look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtaken several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's crime scene.
He then shot a pass left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Mathew Ryan with his right shoe Brighton-Torschüter and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net just before he slipped into the net.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 am in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim versus Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the Nationals have been eliminated from the playoff competition, there is little reason to force further use.
However, the always powerful joke hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies, who have a game lead in the NL West in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for which playoffs are relevant.
The Rockies scored at least one wild card with a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why shouldn't I want to take part in this competition?"
Nationals have not announced a starting player for Sunday yet, but are inclined to have jokes cast in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practised in Bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington Law-Handler has this season a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump stops rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in relation to the Kavanaugh board chosen by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electorate's participation in the intermediate elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I don't get started, but in reality I'm starting, which is why I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means, you see the commonality, the abominableness.
They don't care who hurts them, who they have to overcome, to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission 'to resist and block'.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged and mean and horrible and dishonest."
He named the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate Judicial Committee, Senator Diane Feinstein, which triggered loud noises at the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Have you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, wax.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer allowing all opinions to be heard.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this was hardly surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a series of Labour Members to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for having a different opinion from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy did not share with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'all meetings should be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as local Labour delegates were just that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today have not been marked by this tone, and the promised 'kinder, more careful' policy has long been forgotten when it has ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged on whether or not it is accepted by the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader. Colleagues, with whom I believed to share previously similar political views, now expected me to take a turn-around and to take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it be with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – follow a chimphetirade in the social media that calls for my election, appeals to the political center and says that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I have made are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues, who face daily a flood of sexual or racist insults and yet never give in to little.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normality.
Jeremy Corbyn requested last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to be expressed, and with every motion of censure and any change in the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have often been advised not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have no problems.
But I did not go into politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally separated my classroom in the entire school who joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who most urgently need them – as a councillor as well as as cabinet minister.
I have never made a mockery of my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of Friday's request: given that the country is going to take a break for Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I do not address this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many attempts to vote or political purpose will not prevent me from acting in my opinion the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeated ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only team of ten unbeated at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defenses as well as to their better chance utilization, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have taken advantage of their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to make the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught a non-enhanced attempt.
Climo expanded the leadership of Ayr with a criminal trial before he scored a hit in the half term and then made an increased attempt alone, so that it stood at break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose began the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a prolonged interruption due to a severe injury by Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr built his advance through a trial by Stafford McDowall raised by Climo.
Then, acting as Captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase, Melrose had enormous pressure paid the additional man through a non-enhanced attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained a touchdown from the prison street behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased as it has almost been since the break-up after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxkick and released flank player Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new careers in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the restaurant after it turned out that he was called managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of his leading roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kühr seems to plan a life for Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kühr is interested in entering Glasgow's "florating restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": The Bolivian included in the country hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in La Paz in front of the sea main quarter decorated with ropes.
A sea blue flag blows on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
To recover it is a duty."
All over the country, the memory of the coastal section lost in Chile in a bloody 19th century in Chile is as lively as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court to be passed on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result of course with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians are being persecuted by the IGH's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who will face a controversial battle for his re-election next year, there is also much at stake in the Monday judgment.
"We are just about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN agency, based in the Netherlands, is not entitled to respond to the Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, notes that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has taken care of the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' warring rhetoric choked any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had been exceptionally quick.
On Monday Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end the 139 years of disputes to the mutual advantage," he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the topic of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement promises made in Singapore during a summit between the leaders of the rival states.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be facing more than three months after the summit with North Korean Head of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore shortly before launching the fast-paced nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and resistance from the United States against a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North to kneel, as a "brain spun".
Washington is sceptical and does not want to agree to the statement without Pjøngiang taking essential disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pjöngyang is serious about the omission of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris the latest collections for huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you will no longer have to search for it.
On the walkway, designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headgear for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the walkway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feathered wide edge, which just repressed the heads of the models.
As other oversized accessories, watermelons, a magic hat and even an pineapple were shown with jewels. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were lined with sewn lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
A creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkels and diving goggles, while another looked like a molten desert.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide edge, which all carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the walkway: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as large as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bass bag in reddish orange with bastfransen and a white leather hook was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMIIL: "I reckon that large hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has so much excitement that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Knowledge of Languages for World Citizens Essential
Scotland's independent schools are still distinguished by academic excellence. This has continued in 2018 with further outstanding audit results and is only underpinned by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for training and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as a world citizen.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and popular in schools as candidates.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, you will reach out to his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
The current audit results of this year we find that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved Note A during the higher exams.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Note A during the higher examinations, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Languages are today seen as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and in other places.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons that employers called for the problems of occupying vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed when it comes to preparing young people for their future occupation.
As more and more open jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Communicating directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people a head start before competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to entertain, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today's children that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, especially those of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always be able to choose a number of languages with corresponding specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may be.
At this stage, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain of fundamental importance for the future of the country, and that is why this needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as 'international communication capability'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James enter Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, waiting will be over soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday's opening game.
But how many minutes he'll be playing is not established yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week James was asked for training according to his plans for the six-game preseason plan of the Lakers.
"In this phase of my career, I don't need any preseason games to prepare for me," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five performances planned for the next week, including in his well-meaning places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the Vakance at the Supreme Court, Trump would like to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republican are at risk of losing control of the Congress.
When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as live stream on YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the Kavanaugh board nominated for the Supreme Court on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in silence for up to a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this rally series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's election team told Reuters that these five demonstrations will serve to "mobilize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"Control of the Congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel as many states as possible, while the active campaign season is approaching," said a Trump electoral speaker who did not want to call his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, "Ohio and Pennsylvania will participate and report media from Pittsburgh" at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling for tonight's event.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state that he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows willingness to fight in order to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parts might have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
As a sports concept, the swinging pendulum of the moment is a pure invention, but one that the players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So where is the moment of their opinion now?
"They were in charge with six points, and now there are four, so I think that means a small moment for us," said Jordan Spieth on leaving the venue.
Of course, Europe is in the advantage of four points, while twelve are in the forefront.
However, the Americans, according to Spieth, feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from drop to green and goes on with a good example.
The guttural enthusiasm became louder in the course of his round when he sunk an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them, after he and Thomas had dropped two holes with two points.
His coup, which decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream, which indicates that the American team is not yet out of play.
"I really have to get in and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
This is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days as the only player in the last two days and thus undoubtedly wrote the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's uneven, but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly between them and the sheer amount of flowing energy underpinned that they are the players to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
To speak of European fame would, however, be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-person hero of the morning who played together with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spanish and the Swedish to a clamp that they could not almost overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clamp.
Because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly, the four- and four-compartments look so fascinating from the distance.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe will take the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the fourers and fours from Saturday to the USA with 10:6 and goes with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the difficult Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to recover the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four in the morning against the playing American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parts, the US made more resistance and won two matches, but was unable to pick up the remainder.
Jim Furyks team needed eight points in the twelve played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newcomer, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend 'Molliwood', won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmoniously harmonised and beat the enchanted Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau with an even stronger 5/4.
Woods, who had toiled through two matches on Saturday, had his brilliance flashed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2/11 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris did not run everything according to their ideas.
The triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2/5-1 win over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4/3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup it has only happened twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a minimum of four points. However, as a title holder for Furyk’s team a decision is enough to keep the trophy.
After being second only for two days, it doesn't look as if they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament with no confidence
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would by no means unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that last year North Korea 'had taken substantial action by good will'. For example, it had stopped nuclear and rocket tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and committed itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding US reaction," he said.
'Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will by no means equip ourselves unilaterally first.'
While Ri confided in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phasewise" approach to denukularization, in which North Korea was rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed to be repeated significantly in so far as it did not reject unilateral denuklarization from the outset, as Pjongyang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a President-in-Office of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. Kim had assured him that he was working on the "denucleation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea strives for an official end to the Korea War that led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pjongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resists demands for a relaxation of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
'The United States insists on 'first denucleation' and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even against the 'explanation of the end of the war', Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to kneel is a brain spasm of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not agree with plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party on the denukularization issue instead of the US, it would not have come to this standstill in the denukularization of the Korean peninsula."
However, the sound of Ris Rede differed enormously from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States, after "the evil President" Trump Kim had called "the rocketman" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened with the "total destruction" of North Korea, pushed Kim to the United Nations with praise for his courage in regard to disarmament steps, but he said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would have to remain in place until the de-cullarization of North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – don't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denukularization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to dry out Pjongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes financially.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjongyang, he said that progress had been made just to be accused of North Korea hours later, he had made 'walking-like demands'.
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States adopted "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in primary education this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture, keeping themselves awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unneeded when it comes to paying attention.
The course was conceived by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only experiencing this now, in my last year?’
After her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university had opted for the introduction of the course after she had found that students were under heavy sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the sporting performance and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term withdrawal of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine using an interactive map of the university site.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of shifting a "night shift" was still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Sufficiently good sleep, he said, should be the 'secret weapon' of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety. In addition, a weight gain could be avoided, as sleep withdrawal put the brain in starvation mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had finished one of his courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to undertake a similar study program before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, the students should present themselves with an alarm clock for bedtime and awakening time and be aware of the damaging effects of the "blue light" that comes from electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the clock. This leads to problems during sleep.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game, when Dolly Menga's hits for Steven Gerrard's single-playing team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first away win since the 4:1-Triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard to the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind those leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before halftime, and the impoverished rangers seemed to have no chance of compensating.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers are also in danger of further trouble after Liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtaken Ayr and reached the semi-final of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took a point for the Hearts last week, and would have to be enthusiastic about how his well trained team held their opponents on step and step under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They were supposed to score a goal after only two minutes when Mengas first gave Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal. However, the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Keaghan Jacobs then reached the captain Craig Halkett for a long time, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot past the rear.
Rangers took control, but their game in the last third seemed rather hopeful than convincing.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour of a clash between him and Steven Lawless, he should have suffered a crime, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not allow the complaints of the Colombian.
The Rangers made only two goals in the first half of the year, but the former Ibrox Gatekeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits in the 34th minute might not correspond to the game, it is not to deny that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Once again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson's shot, which kept the rest and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game they are playing, where Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball from the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also later demanded a penalty shot after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: Inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as violin counter.
The violin counter has since become the standard element of science and became a standard element of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film with apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a violin counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Actually, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" debilitated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy debilitated cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect debilitated cells in the course of treatment.
The method removes immune cells from a patient that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancerous common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize debilitated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells that are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" the many types of cancer common protein HER2. Then the cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are removed immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump-Tirade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA-Kuppe ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was founded in the studio at Saturday Night Live after he praised Donald Trump for a long time and said he wanted to take office as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make America-Great-Again cape, he continued with a chimpanzee against the Democrats and stressed his support for Trump again.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? It’s racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of board Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock to social media.
It's not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the West release.
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage because of his headcovering.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with the cap."
They harassed me!
And then they say I was in a submerged area," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said, "I'm going to put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments triggered at least twice a booming call from the audience, and SNL contributors were embarrassed to touch, said Variety. One person said the magazine: "It was dead still in the studio."
West had been obliged late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West many confused with a lecture on the title "I Love it", in which he was disguised as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Danke, THAT YOU HAVE REMOVED THE MASSE."
The talkshow moderator Karen Hunter twittered, however, that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, owns and gives of himself a harmful ideology for my community (by buying his music or his clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same is true for us.", she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the macho hero’s stereotype. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling to be strong in order to be respected.
In conversation with 'The Sunday Times Culture', Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo age was to be solved.
Mr Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who also played a part in "Game of Thrones", also 31 years ago, admitted that he was "very important" in solving the problem.
"I personally at present find the question of what has been wrong with manhood," he said.
"What have we taught adult men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that television is probably partly responsible for increasing toxic masculineity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change this?
For with the young men something has clearly gone wrong."
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones". He had "ample of battlefields and horses".
As of November, Harington was seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that the best thing for him was "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife at this show, so I've kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the numerous Emmy's famous fantasy series Ygrette, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the vast majority of the new cases through sexual intercourse.
HIV has so far spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, reported Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission due to sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex relations with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to inadequate protection in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees had the data from the GOP senators leaked, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. representative's house, protests on Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has published the personal information of three republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
Democrat from Los Angeles expressed the opinion that the claims of "ultra-right" experts and websites would be disseminated.
"Lies, lies and even more horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published should include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The publication took place after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the contributions is assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was not in any way responsible for transmitting this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ explanation quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press spokesperson of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," said Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the defendant's motives.
They must be quiet and let go."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having acted too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who takes part in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he twittered.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my staff."
Criticism of “Johnny English – You Live Only Three Times” – weak spying parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-coloured new film. This also seems to be true for the revival of the “Johnny English” action group, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spion who published it” and relived with “Johnny English – Now First Right”.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject, how obvious we are, become the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glotchy, grizzly cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for a second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in non-English speaking space.
Of course, he is once again the clumsy secret agent, who apparently thinks himself cool and worldly, while, in reality, he has contributed a bit of closeness, a prank Mr. Bean and a prank of this boy, who has a single note at the opening celebration of the 2012 Olympic Games in London to the title melody of "The Hour of Victor".
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind travellers and international secret agents who played the Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades applied to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is on the rise, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the 'serious' series such as '007' and 'mission impossible' now offer self-confident comedian elements.
The humor seems to be aimed more at children than at adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mischief is not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The eternally current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British espionage network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very much to the failure of the operative, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure, which is already before the complete collapse due to its political in popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn't give much of what she can work with.
Their secret service consultants inform them that all active spies have been decapitated and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes the tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but is unofficially teaching in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of school of rock.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, who is replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terrible wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is in danger of a charismatic tech billionaire, Jason Volta, who was played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the UK's computer problems.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the grotesque spas: Dressed as a waitress, they put a chic French restaurant in fire, they provide chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the subject is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Fairly moderate.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, ‘Can’t the British film industry Rowan Atkinson play a role that really satisfies his talent?’
Labour contests to work on a plan that the British work four days a week, but should be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party wishes to report that business leaders pass on to employees the savings achieved by the AI Revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day.
This would have made the employees a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, 'fits the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - ranking Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an endeavour consistent with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
At present, however, the approach is not generally supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "In a four-day week it is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell put into practice at the Labour Conference last week his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of 'anonymous directors' and 'profit-makers' in public utilities.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their entire share, as a Labour government could make 'deductions' due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to recruit employees to the boards of companies and set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to the employees, paying up the annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in the news magazine '60 Minutes' whether the investigation by the FBI in the Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed for at least one week a final vote on his appointment to judge at the Supreme Court and raises the question of whether the results of the government could influence Republican senators in order to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could show anything that could ultimately change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told them in the trial that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, said this claim, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been chiseled into stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to break a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has fought this vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who called them could not confirm it."
It's now 36 years old.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive line-up to stars and an equally impressive mission – to combat poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to do a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project if you consider that Global Citizen will remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of looking forward to a cool free concert a useful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reported that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve different goals.
These actions should have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least USD 10 billion of which have already been paid out or contracted by fundraising.
According to the Group's estimates, the funds secured to date have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementations based in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with USD 35 million to fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions, with which the UK was asked to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But similar to the large civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will be successful, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform at this year's event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can use the Navy if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary Ryan Zinke announced.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s use in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in energy, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that sea roads remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc turned to the participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that understands itself as "the class of electricity consumers" in the USA.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, calling Russia "One Trick Pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made when the government was under Trump to expand the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, the much more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, with which according to Trump Berlin became a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline worth 11 billion US dollars, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States has received counterwinds from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," says the board of directors of the BDI Dieter Kampf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine" a presidential candidate for 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to 'examine' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
In their criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, Warren has not taken a note.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that prior to the vote, of course, an FBI investigation is required.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to the survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of the former Governor Deval Patrick; 38 percent in favour of a potential candidate, and 48 percent in favour.
Among the other names of prominent Democrats who are eligible for a possible 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin on Donald Trump-Ralley expresses himself as a post-traumatic stress disorder under which track palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he gets back, he's going to be able to imitate other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "Elephant in space" and said about her son and other veterans of war that they were coming back, that they were broken down, that they were coming back and wondering if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and D.C. support an appeal for a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new US policy that refuses victims of gang activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and districts filed an expert report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who questions politics, NBC reported news.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace-versus-sessions complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not announced.
She announced that her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused them, but US officials rejected their asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people file an application for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with great problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum on the run from domestic violence.
The federal prosecutor of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of legislation at state, state and international level".
"The Bundesgesetz requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court violates this principle," was stated in the CFI's statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse to enter the country has an adverse impact on the economy in the US, since immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workers.
In June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs no longer grant asylum.
"Asyl exists for those who leave their home country because they are persecuted or because of fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan by granting asylum to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems people face every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her small fevering son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to gather their plentiful wealth and wealth and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu’s military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the continuing severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he reported the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. ambassadors accuse China of tyranny with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper sent a four-page announcement in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing’s capital city of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering with the US Congress elections on November 6, an accusation that China contests.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has attempted to interfere in US elections correspond to the announcement of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an exuberant trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
Chinese reimbursement duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and former long-standing Governor of Iowa, who exports large quantities of agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing has damaged workers, owners of agricultural holdings and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by making propaganda announcements in its own free press in the USA.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming America's proven tradition of free expression and the independent press by switching paid advertising on the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"By contrast, you will find only a limited number of votes against here in Beijing and will not find a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese could have about China's worrying economic development, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans disperse voters before the interim elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming interim elections, which could be made by women in particular.
The mood in this connection was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they are continuing with a vote.
"Such things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last minute advance (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to dampen angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily paper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the hall of the Senate called "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to adhere to the nomination of Kavanaughs and reported that despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with voters in the suburbs and with younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't choose."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidates are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
'It is not just about the vote of the panel, final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it', Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, informed the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree with whom they should believe because of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably Kavanaugh believed.
Furthermore, 38% stated that they believe Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying to his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an oath-making statement last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitalia to her when she was at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to prevent Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a market with the aim of establishing a competition on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source solid platform of Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can select where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee suggested that the intent behind Inrupt was the "world domination".
"We need to be active now," he said on the topic of startup.
'It is a historic moment.'
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library and other private and corporate tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide alone who can access any data.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea behind inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding skills to make solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been appointed to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not be exchanging with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made, in which their entire business models are completely transformed overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a post on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a significant role in the debate on grid neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the Web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carrier of the Viktoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Viktoria Cross during World War I was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 due to his engagement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British War Award.
His two grandchildren revealed a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later he pushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before he rushed forward with a field weapon alone and shut off three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were something he could never live up to, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero became visible mainly through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not surprised to see Peppa Pig suddenly.
Some remained untouched after they stayed awake until early morning hours to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to the movie character as some sort of bad joke.
"Because of a government regulation, these contents are considered non-youth-free, so that at 6 o'clock a children's mission had to be changed," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the marketing and communication field at Bellator when he was interviewed for the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the schedule to take future viewers from the United Kingdom into account.
"I think the problem might be solved in the replay game," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday at the audience in the UK, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay on it.
There was a lot of communication at the time of the change. It went pretty much apart and it wasn't always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical problem.
What was not the case was a government problem.
I promise this won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case. And we have tried to provide the fans with the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels at home about sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a jumper in various Olympic games, says that he has grown up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old thought that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Lavorne he said he spoke on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victory at the Olympics is no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses illness for several months.
In the first shipment of Laverne, he said that earlier he regarded himself as inferior compared to others, since love for boys and girls was totally unacceptable socially.
He said: "To this day, feeling is inferior to others and different from the others, reason for my power and strength, and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this subject because he fortunately wanted to live without restrictions and without discrimination and to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. Knowing to fall in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference was never a topic.
He means if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games with 14 for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, it is hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire vision has changed since then.
Last year, he had turned everything around gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important than the Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be on the front page.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he continued.
In the following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I only knew it was always my dream to dive in the Olympics in front of the local audience – that was the madness," he said.
His first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – was influenced by it too. He heard the song in the run-up to the Olympics and still cared for goosebumps.

Mickelson, currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will record his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that it doesn't turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer in these tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points behind the 12 single games put a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Fury confidently expressed himself to Mickelson and could not add much to it.
"He was perfectly aware of his present role, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's famous personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he'd be in two games.
I had introduced myself more, but that's how it went, and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most rider Cup games performed on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup racetrack that never quite matched the highlights of its personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had to strike 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He is funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he is a great person who is popular with the whole team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little more this week. It was fun to see them.
He is a truly interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can soon be over with the lead.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only just over the finish line came and led with the smallest possible advantage and achieved a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
"The thought remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," said Bjørn (pictured in the photo), after he had seen the victory of 5–3 of the class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
It's going to be okay tomorrow.
Get in the bag and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing's only over when the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I've always said that I'm concentrating on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what's facing us on the other hand: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance his players have performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overstep that.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow, individual services are in the foreground, and this is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things are good, but if you're out there alone, you're tested up to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart to Jim Furyk will make sure that his players individually cut out better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Fury himself stood on both sides of those great turnarounds on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner’s side before he stood on the side of the losers after Europe’s “Wonder of Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum moves in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we try to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of counter-matching, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as another European in the upper half of the ranking.
"I decided for the boys in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The newest frigates of the German Navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace the years of warships from the Cold War. However, according to local media, it will be delivered due to faulty systems and rapid growing costs only at the earliest next year.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new "Baden-Wuerttemberg" class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time which called for a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after the extradition.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and target missiles as well as core technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may lead to the ageing of the state-of-the-art warships, which Germany is supposed to represent as sea power, according to Die Zeit.
Last year, the Freggate F125, followed by disaster, went into headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a series of significant "software and hardware faults" which made the new ship useless in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships in the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to loss of performance and prevents the marine from carrying out upgrade measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of 'Rhineland-Palatinate' was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost increased to stunning €3.1 billion, compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the newest frigates are particularly important given the recent warnings that Germany's sea power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's military officer, confirmed that the Navy was "going out of use".
Bartels said that the problem grew over time, since old ships were out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research work is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future nature conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown Langohr and water bats in Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the plot to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
When analysing all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and what species does it do.
Then a map and a report of the habitat is created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that have an effect on sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flyers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by house cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes because of their night hunting habits when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echotype to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave area in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Gutsmanager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threeave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things that we do not yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we carry out these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it was possible that the accidental destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and destroy the entire population on site.
Bats are under protection and it is illegal to kill them, to harass them, or to destroy them or their nest sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish friend of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and in many of our species we don't know how they are about their populations."
Ronaldo disbands rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape charges against him "fake news" and said that people want to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine The mirror that published the allegations.
The national team storm of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence on the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo named the reports “Fake News” hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to get famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror on the grounds of the allegations which, according to Reuters, they described as 'inadmissible reporting on private-sector suspects'.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded compensation for “moral damages at a level equivalent to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident should have occurred in 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After getting to know each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room where, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada, he mainly raped them anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to her knees after the alleged incident, and she said that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was agreeable.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because she had "anxiety for retribution" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to break up the agreement, as it is still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was standing just before the alleged incident to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid and changed this summer in a 100 million euros deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘everlasting regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “repent forever” if, according to Brexit, it lost its status as a leading global car manufacturer, said Minister for Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He continued to say that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant at Derby, should Britain leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of border delays in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
Last year, the factory in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our plant at an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears about a hard EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini plant in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers both from the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at Derbyshire plant, which would last longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the senior official of the Unite union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience of this job never comes back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to information from the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be 'moved for another week', while the dispute between the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversees the work of the special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates the interferences of Russia, links between Trump's advisers and Russia, and a possible judicial impediment by the president.
The question whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thus endanger Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and the president's appointment with the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports on his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump said he would not let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was moved to avoid collapsing with the hearing before the US Senate Judicial Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, stated.
On Friday, Trump arranged a one-week FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On a question to the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "A date has not yet been set for this; it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences did not show an aversion to the 'effect hashish' of the TV reporters, but admitted: 'I would not deny that they are operating an effect hashish'.
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more question-and-answer rounds than any President before him," she said, without any precise evidence: "We have seen these figures."
There will still be press conferences, according to Sanders, but it is “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States direct questions, but far better than to speak to me.
We often try to do this and you have seen that we have done this often over the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when, in front of the assembled reporters, he performed a bizarre appearance from the rudder.
Minister of Health writes about Brexit concerns about EU workers in Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health is addressing people from EU countries who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and express their wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the cost of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times that must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency after a head injury
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodore, as reported by Mike Organ of Tennessee State.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff supplied abercrombie on the side line with oxygen before it was placed on a carry-on and transported for further investigations.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type or extent of injury are yet known" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a Redshirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, which increased his total number to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp taxes for real estate purchases in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. The additional revenue will benefit homeless persons in accordance with the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step will end Jeremy Corbyn's success campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will concern all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, benefiting the multiple income of homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters who promise to provide more affordable living space and take top-earners to the sights.
The increase in stamping tax is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional revenue is to be given to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the two-year increase in second-dwelling and rental leftover properties, the surcharge could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance estimates by taking the step with additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom, thus increasing prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, particularly in the capital, have become “spirit cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson decided to reduce the stamp tax in order to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of holding up real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's 'dwelling damage'.
The opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for housing reforms that range from a rental price commitment to a ban on spaces without a good reason.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which the life of generation to generation should be improved.
And that means repairing our broken apartment market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far for too many people and the indifference of homelessness remains a problem too great."
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says that it is his “greatest goal” to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of kicking the club out of the North-East of England's new life, which is in third place in the League One and missing the top three points.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that was it," Ross told the broadcast sports sound of BBC Scotland.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always drags me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I was successful in association management."
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic said not to be afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names with such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured in my mind at the moment whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably appreciate my time here only as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy head of Dumbarton and a 15-month training activity in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than ever before in his playing career at Clyde, Hardlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a true way of divorce," he recalls when he assumed the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny because I didn't feel bad, could live well from it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I have always wanted to manage and now I do it. I have never felt so comfortable in my skin as an adult throughout my life."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heat wave in the summer has slowed the revenue of Britain's crisp pubs, while restaurant chains are under greater pressure.
Public and bar companies recorded an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but, according to statistics, revenue from restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Anhalt sunshine and England’s longer than expected continued participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which pubs recorded sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, restaurant hit it even harder.
The 1.8 percent decrease in the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a world-adjusted sales development, which grew higher than they did at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffer in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, analysts for the RSM leisure and restaurant industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for the out-of-home sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to sustained cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at any worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food, and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the much needed breath."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that it hides from its parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has found an increase on so-called 'Fake Insta' pages
The message sparks fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" to show their parents.
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message sparks fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students reported having a clean "main account" that they can show their parents to own private accounts as well.
One mother, who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who asked the other to " rape me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which gave way to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being seduced into creating online rooms in which parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'stim of athletes' in the Scottish sports council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member in the council of Scottish Athletics-Dachverband Scottish Athletics at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding athlete and the chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution to sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, calls his own four Olympic gold medals and today often appears as BBC experts, could no longer run after a transient bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can say if or how far I'm going to heal.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the net with an advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared with the milking of cows.
In order to launch the "first low-noise milk pump worldwide" according to its own specification, the consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has published a music video which is not very serious in order to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines such as: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a cock" or "if you haven't noticed it, these are not euthanasias but my breasts."
In the chorus it continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the web.
With 77.000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions from the audience, many of whom say that it is harmless to the "frights" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Just as we do, they must become pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days of birth," said a comment.
The milk pump from Elvie fits discreetly into a still bra (elvie/mother)
Another comment was: “Exceptably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "Such a non-reality advertising."
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," one person wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at the workplace or in toilets) and feel like "cow".
This is not an advertisement for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps indicate how to feel like dairy cows.
The pump of Elvie, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: "The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it earned a daring and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumping and all the challenges involved at the heart, while at the same time presenting the incredible sense of freedom that allows the new pump.
This is not the first time that the pump of Elvie got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants were brought quietly and quietly to a tent city on the Texan border
The number of interned migrants children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things because intensified rhetoric and measures by the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children with supervisors.
Traditionally, most caregivers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become even the target of an expulsion when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caretakers and other adult members of their household would have to print their fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the Customs Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 per cent of those who are either self-employed or members of a household of a caregiver are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are non-residents.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with the children’s cases, the officials introduced new rules, which according to the staff of the accommodation for some children, required to appear in court within one month instead of 60 days after the detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video switching and not personally to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
If negative decisions are taken, the person is quickly expelled.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to information from the accommodation staff as well as reports that have been known from the system over the past month, that they are being anxious and depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are heightened at a larger institution like Tornado, as there are signs that a child has problems that are easier to overlook due to the size.
They also explained that it could strengthen traumas that many of the children already suffer when they are taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish crews to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil and were "treated accordingly" with the pretext of fighting terrorism.
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror was almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people died and millions more people were expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned up" both by terrorist groups and by "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has deployed some 2000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return had been met and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" to prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable their return," he said.
'They are politicizing a really purely humanitarian matter.'
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid was granted for Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the UN stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel high-rise Idlib represents the possibility of initiating political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, allied to Al-Qaeda, will be carried out which will be 'extinguished'.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the terms of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and stated that his work should be limited to the "review of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, it should not, as many liberal spectators probably hope, end his presidency prematurely or a scandal.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no evidence that the audience would be sick of it.
Since 2014, the switch-on ratios at the best transmission time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the set-up to 3.5 million viewers in evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that magically attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series 'Designated Survivor' on TV channel ABC about a cabinet member who will be president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he’s making me laugh’” Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertaining.
Of course, contrary to television, the stories from Washington can determine the future of the basic decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning it off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it is also possible to be an informed citizen if you are aware that you have already watched six hours of a round of experts using sources from the so-called "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (shown Washington Post a "clothes rich in self-esteem") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's tearing description of Trump's, um, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
“A part of what he does can be felt like a reality show he imagines every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily action applications (a dispute with the football league NFL breaking down the fence, Kim Jong-un praises).
You can't afford to miss a episode, otherwise you won't come along anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but it was in and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn't get off the screen, not if Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was right in front of the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy missions at the time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was a kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donations flow the narrowest races around seats in Congress during the intermediate elections
It is little surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly drawn borders of the electoral district, which led to two officials in the race sitting around the same seat.
The recently re-drawn suburb district in Pittsburg allows the Democratic Conor Lamb to enter, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapped with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were attacked by the Constitution and manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of electoral funding between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th constituency of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and Trump won the lead with 20 percentage points.
Police experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The US tested El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then returned.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with the president of Panama's Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama to partner the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to remove the heads of all U.S. foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of 'the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan', says Heather Nauert, Minister of State spokesperson in a statement at the beginning of the month.
However, in the case of El Salvador, only consideration was given to penalties estimated at 140 million dollars in the year 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicides.
While internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the US.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wished the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference that was held in mid-October, in order to give a sign of the importance that the government of the Assembly attaches to it, according to diplomatic statements.
The three American diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new sharp announcements or criminal sanctions from Washington.
A government speaker from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak on the internal meetings under the terms of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next big surprise could be the report by the special investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller now allegedly also investigates whether Trump's campaign team has been conspiring with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, Trump faced himself with an organ that forces him to account, exactly at the time he passed on, to step back before the voters; and possibly before a jury of swearings.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that Donald Trump's case, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we need to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West had resisted him and had supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in devil's kitchen since last year's newspaper reported that he suggested recording the president secretly and speculating about whether he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the representation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and the false statement?
And above all, will we vote in the middle elections for a congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we'll be in the middle of a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Chekhoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away 60 years later, to set Sabbath candles on the table with the cross of the hook.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive Remis against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
"This was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good," says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we went home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but overall, a decision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a heavy game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Afraid of old age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, only a few of them talked to their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance division of Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your long-term financial decisions can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn over legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a guardian so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about taking medicine or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What is the medical treatment?"
Who takes care of the dog?

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shots that took place at about 02:30 p.m. as 'wild acts'.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities said. The number of dead should still rise.
Because of the outstanding communication systems, auxiliary forces were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 persons were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary as the earthquake and the tsunami took place.
Donggala is a district of government located in the northwest of Sulawesi Island over a coastline of over 300 km (180 miles).
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, lived in 2017 estimated 299,900 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue from the Central Sulawesis industry, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was met in 1996 by a Tsunami where nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on December 26 which hit 14 countries and cost 226,000 people lives in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatras between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the Sumatras coast.
2006: An earthquake with a strength of 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the South Coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with a strength of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died of collapse in buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular among tourists, and claimed more than 500 lives on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor Alaskas and former candidates for Vice-President's office, was arrested due to allegations of body injury.
The 29-year-old palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of suspicion of domestic violence, inhibition of domestic violence and resistance to state violence, as a report published by the Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a friend when he wanted to get in touch with the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is under investigation in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and it was collected a security deposit of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when he was asked for his plea, he answered with "Not guilty, certainly," according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three class A crimes, which can be spent up to a year in prison and a fine of up to USD 250,000.
He is also burdened with an inviolability of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Alaska Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, violation of the notification of a crime and possession of weapons in connection with the incident.
His friend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she traced the behavior of her son to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted and it is expected that the number of dead will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the Tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Prosecution Demands Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York’s Terrorist Attack
The federal prosecutor in New York called for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the terrorist attack of New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has been no longer imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the Home Depot building market chain for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he raced on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, passing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs have to prove that Saipov had 'targeted' the eight victims and added 'conscious' serious injuries to the body, it is stated in the Memorandum of Understanding for the claim of the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court paper.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigating court, Saipov, filed an appeal in 22 points involving eight charges of the murder against the background of organised crime, normally used by state prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as an accusation of the practice and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack calls for 'basic planning and intent', according to the prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov committed the act as 'abominable, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss," said the explanation.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer been pursuing a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was committed in New York during a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who two years earlier were guilty of the conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, was born in the days and months after the attack of lack of remorse, according to court documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was actually inspired after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also demanded, according to police reports, to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, a public defender representing Saipov, said that she was "of course disappointed" because of the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to call for the death penalty, instead of a confession in exchange for a lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all parties," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charges not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MEP calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
The former head of the Ukip party said that politicians must 'feel the pressure' of the Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should conduct negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backman Peter Bone explained to the Birmingham demonstrators that the United Kingdom would be “ready to go outside” if Farage Brexit ministers were.
The challenge facing May in reconciling its deeply disputed parties was exacerbated by the fact that members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping her compromise plan Chequers on track despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the oppositionary Labour Party to decide between their package and the 'chaos'.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leaf demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the trash’.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would already be outside," he said.
Wellingborough's honourable Member added: 'I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers is a waste.'
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people had changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit advocate of Conservative Andrea Jenkenys was also at the demonstration and explained to reporters: ‘I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a pointed message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister will keep her jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians need to ‘feel pressure’, that they should just be cheating on the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” says Farage.
“They try to cheat Brexit, and that’s why we are here today to tell them, ‘that’s not what you’re coming from’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is shortly before betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will help us win the referendum and never come to rest, as long as we are not independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A few activists waved banners from the Toriest Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the tories that had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
There's just no good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to “examine” the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would "examine the presidential candidate".
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts.
Warren, an outstanding critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the Senate's re-election against the Republican MPs in Massachusetts's Geoff Diehl Parliament, who was vice-president of Trump's campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the focus of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke has been their 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's official appearance.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to "go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrested after killing on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of the fatal shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference to arrest the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 o'clock in the morning Eastern Time.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury on his head and died as a result of this injury," according to information from the sports media portal 247 sports by the police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday explained the media.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been at the scene and possession of a weapon and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 start-ups in the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the stable order of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton enter the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box one round later and landed behind Vettel, but overtook Hamilton after a short wheel-on-wheel maneuver, where the Ferrari pilot defiantly released the inside with the risk of holding off after two moves in order to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the back squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round in the seventh place.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri made an excellent performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me by.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of a campaign on Senator Diane Feinstein, who insisted on not passing on the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he charged the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh with sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement before the Senate's judicial committee did not address directly, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are "grudging, evil and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when you see the rage when you see people who are angry and mean and vicious and dishonest," said the President.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Thinking of your answer... Publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
All right, just a minute, please.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was played with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the Leak comes from her office.
"I have not hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, I have not published your story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for secrecy."
Her Dementi did not seem to be coming well with the president, who said on Saturday night at the election campaign event: “I tell you one, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In its continuous defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual abuse by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
One sees the commonality, the evil, they don't care about who hurts them when they get under the wheels to gain power and control," said the president, according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat again on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were led by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier in the early stages.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team back to balance before Dwyer made the Giants' leadership again.
Francois Bouchard went out for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe who struck Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, where the Giant won the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the template when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie left for his compensation after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants before the half-time break when he reached his second gate of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard joined again with a power play event in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then won his team with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in the Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air Force pilots died after he made sure hundreds of people in a plane escaped the earthquake
A pilot pilot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to safely launch an aircraft with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are caught in ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to be sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousand. The National Civil Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
'The number is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached', said the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho authority.
Waves with a height of up to 6 meters have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN stated: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech in front of the country’s military: “I ask you all day and night to work to accomplish all the tasks associated with evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" says CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini is now reported by a missing person after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that conducted the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting on a missing person after she first claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a communication that they cannot say anything about a passenger's whereabouts until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials were told that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday six passengers were still in the hospital but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy both explained that the aircraft landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane was flying out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
"This is a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade to the emergency exits on the side of the falling aircraft by means of hip-deep water.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working near the improvement of a site were rushing with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data of the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people have died in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The charge ended on Saturday her evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of expelling a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett spent hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers at her death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was together with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, says the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he reported to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford joined the stand on Saturday and said that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis reported to have known Chambers at their time of death for two weeks.
But cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost some time after Chamber's death their messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone.
"He took them out of his life," says Hale.
The defense is expected to start their pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumed that the proceedings were subsequently before the jury that day.

Another black one?!
New Yorker nanny sued couple for a release after "racist" text message
A New York nanny sues a couple because of a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misguided message from the mother in which she complained that she was "a black one yet."
The couple disputed to be racist and compared the dispute with a 'burden'.
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new day's mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she approached her first working day in 2016.
"NEAWALEEEEEEEINE, NOT A SWARZE," wrote her husband's Plasco-Flaxman in a textual message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice. Twice.
After recognizing her Fauxpas, the “wishly touched” Plasco-Flaxman Maurice dismissed and claimed that the open-minded African-American day-mother had done bad work and instead expected a Philippine woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day of work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the 350 dollars a day, which she should have lasted for over six months, for which the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," said the newspaper on Friday, "I know that is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racist accusations and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice after they had insulted them to no longer be able to trust.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained husband Joel Plasco of the post office.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with a "pressing" and said that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want to interest such a person?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and appealed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bearer to write the children's book, had no problem with it, had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death was "bitter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she described as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and didn't brag," says Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that doctors gave her little chance," says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave you to keep their heart at the pumping, slowly stopped and left their bodies.
She had died just before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or howl because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who didn't get any of what she was going through on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives by suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting stations.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18, when he took suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten up a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, since he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his brother, 11 years old.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have a consequence."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't stay still: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt down or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was at the bottom of the road. When the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that it had to go through: “It tears a huge hole into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all carry on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in sleep while the FBI starts investigating
'I thought that if we could actually get something like this that he asked for, that is to say, a time-limited investigation, we could perhaps get a little one-off', said Flake on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an investigation from the FBI?
Your reluctance can be traced back to timing alone.
The mid-term elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans fail to cut down as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone listener to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to decide on a parity vote, and to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflows ‘sinkt’ under Kim
The number of North Korean invaders to South Korea has fallen in power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-zeug, which refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Reconciliation, stated that 1127 offenders were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of the survivors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the invaders to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pjöngyang for talks that focused on the negotiations for the denukularization that had been set up.
In June, as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, they agreed to work on a denucleated Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Mir Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Nancy Pelosi House called judges candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was indisputable to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not resist the impression that a woman who had acted in this way had been called ‘hysterical’," Pelosi said about her reaction to the statement by Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and stood out in tears just before talking about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated assassination" organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as they showed that he was biased towards Democrats.
"I believe that he has declared himself ineffective with these statements and the way in which he brought about the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh of the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge's office," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions Kavanaugh's against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, since he was valued as a conservative judge.
In his hearings Kavanaugh turned out questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We now do not need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'Ah, this is not wonderful'," says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months and years of overwhelming anger and she does not get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said she was crying when she gets angry, but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts to cry, tell the person she said to: “You may think that she is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then they just keep talking.
I found this ingenious."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I was crying because of an indescribable rage and by an older woman, an undercooled manager, before whom I was always a little afraid, packed on the collar and pulled into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship named Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"That was not a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
Since the election campaign had already progressed, it was at the back of the acquisition of funds, and it vowed not to compete if it was not to earn 2 million dollars.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who donated men $1,000 supported their campaign only with $250.
"Do they believe that I get a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so of her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made it so difficult for the voters instead of the delegates, and anger about sexism, that she was so overwhelmed that she was close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I was experiencing a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“One could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my gravestone.
"She cried?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the US and China
The opening ointments of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term digging between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he committed criminal tariffs for important Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new criminal tariffs on goods worth 200 billion dollars, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing struck back in the same way each time and recently raised a penalty of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China pledged to respond to any US action and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon stumble.
If Washington were to be slowed down, it would be too bad for China's President, Xi Jinping, but a public knock on the United States would be far too flattering.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays out its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision could either create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have known before," says Abigail Grace, a scientific assistant who focuses on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria was 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the reconstruction of the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the circumstances in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rebuilding the territories destroyed by terrorists in order to return to normality.
All conditions had now been given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993 in Europe.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with much of the tournament, sank his way down on the 16th line (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player ever with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have made a contribution," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed on the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won in the individual encounters against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods I've been watching since my childhood on television," says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had all weekend problems to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players performed well.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
