Politicians in Wales afraid to "like fools"
There was dismay among some members of the Welsh National Assembly about a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the Assembly's name to Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the change of name could give rise to ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
One member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context the Welsh letter w is spoken in the same way as the letter u is spoken in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a legislative proposal on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on the names which Members of Parliament will be given is, of course, up to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, where there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AM, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option was most endorsed in a public consultation.
AM's suggests apparently alternative options, but the struggle for consensus can prove difficult for the chairman of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on the reforms contains other changes in the way in which the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what they should be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
The voters vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement on the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposes the vote and says that he will support the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is just a price paid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent while the churches of Harlem fight
"The older people I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialise in other ways these days," he said.
"Barer no longer constitutes the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money collected from selling assets does not last long and that they are "before or later, where they started up".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of those people who do not help the neighborhood's recurring resorts.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the owner apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the clock game.
The priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the clock game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not find a substitute for him.
What has been played out in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them caught up with the church leaders, others of the diocese.
In July, the council of the parish council, the head of the parish, composed of leading laymen, wrote to the bishops about the concerns that the bishopship "would try to push the expenses further" to the council of the congregation, although the council of the congregation had not been involved in employing the architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
Shark hurts 13 years on dive after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then together with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just an excitement to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All of his collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, seeing when he came to the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported critically.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked.
The lifeguard Larry Giles said by a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed the access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours in security and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in style with storm gases.
As part of a great deal of effort to absorb the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and residential products are falling. The larger ranges of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they turn out to be a success.
Investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets look for new products for shelves used in the past for television, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have more space with branded areas in style with those you see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches the range of Boutique Makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the tester perfume shop Fragrance Shop is located in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and developing against buying small quantities of food daily with local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to make people visit them.
Mike Coupe, Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores are going to look like stormgasins, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of groceries and have made purchases more profitable.
The previous supermarket attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended with an argument about how the performance of the pharmacies in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and decor of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in particularly trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the ingesting environment and the practical locations mean that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "racial" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' The Star Peter Jones left "racial", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This Morning Host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones furiously, after she withdraws from their lucrative life-style fire at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "racial", when the popular TV woman during an exciting meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, meant that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop-brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project which she would have to deal with for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from This Morning Host, which is among the UK’s highest-income stars, can cost the company several million due to large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby has to be a fire ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin who hosted ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Hard talk, and then we fell in love.
He made a mockery of the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment that "is not worthy of a president" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody on a newsword.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a meeting more, after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho on Saturday told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "correspondent reaction" from the US in relation to the initial action taken by North Korea against disarmament.
He noted that the United States is continuing instead with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump took a more optimistic view of the speech at his election meeting.
"North Korea is doing really well," he said.
"There was a scene for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – termination of rocketsts, help with the release of hostages and the repatriation of earthly remains from American military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this densely packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes ravage island and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations, for example, were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population remained homeless, no state disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international relief.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children combines a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly suffering, it is badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami resorts are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunamisir was missing, and it probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital vessel that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's deficient infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in line with the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge compensates at the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a scoring on the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind by 1-0.
He pointed to the ball at the left foot before he made a high shot against the most distant pole.
The ball flew high above the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting into the position of getting the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 by the halfleg, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea-angriber delivered the heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set the speed up on the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's orbital half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle lane.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the most distant pole with a left foot shot past Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Napoli in the group game in the Champions League at 15 Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 15 Thursday in London.
Deaths from tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 informs the country's disaster preparedness early on Sunday.
Many prisoners were reported in the rubble from buildings that fell down after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the judge scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, told the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the most recent memorial of the debate on the "rewrite of history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposals as "crazy" and a "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed for his grandfather Thomas's actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth paying tribute.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth paying tribute and remembering."
Dræbergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified under his last name "Yuan", was found dead with an excruciating artery of heart rate and mutilated in blood near a pig's path on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to give pigs injections with pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig path next to was open.
He said there was a big thorn in the pig's path with blood in his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan went into the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police are collecting evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig masturbated a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News reported that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just medical.
Those tricks, they're very curious... they're not about hurting you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to provide heavy rain in large parts of the southwestern United States
As predicted, the hurricane is becoming weaker as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rain with floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had a win of 38 m/s, a category 1 hurricane, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure outlet is forming across the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the low pressure emitter that is approaching, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the days to come.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, liquid falls and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will generate rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform canyons into roaring rivers and thunders will create strong local winds and create dust blows.
The approaching low - pressure outlet will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of an overall rainfall of more than 13 mm, which can give smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets cooler, but there remains relatively warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east areas.
It could reach 26 degrees Fahrenheit [26 ° C.] in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern US in the first half of October.
More than 20 million saw the consultation of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million saw Thursday's gripping testimony from the nominee to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that interrupted the regular programs to tell about Friday's late development: An agreement that was made by the senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaughh in a drunken state grunted at her and tried to take her clothes off to a gymnast.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional explanation that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw that Friday.
The company listed average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available audiences from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a audience that corresponds to a fight under the NFL playoffs or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose meaningful hosts have strongly backed up the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the Judicial Committee.
He was standing with a downward look for several minutes while he was being reviled, and CNN sent live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All the TV stations covered live a few hours later when the Judicial Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the belief that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, which the democrats, who are in the minority of the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by talks with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the right to vote in favour of Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister accuses critics of "just politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "legacy" with the future of Britain and undermined national interests, as happened in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to that with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Shot rope on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being responsible for the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned under the suspicion of negligent manslaughter, the Baton Rouge police reported.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the hearing of Simpson, the police said he confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, the police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports leader at the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "circle and hunt for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "knuste" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"It's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," said Wade.
The volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring rum and shaking over several rounds.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car routes in neighbourhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake that measured 7.1 on the judge scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters who want independence, collided with rioters as several thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists kept rioters back, threw with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Fights also occurred later in the day when the police used their staff to keep the fighting down.
Over several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing Forgotten, Nothing Forgived" and met with Unionist demonstrators shouting "Long Living Spain".
14 people received treatment for minor injuries occurring during the protests reported to the local press.
The vote is still very tense in the region of independence one year after the vote of 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The electorate voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electoral alliance was low, and those who opposed the liberation boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at polling sites throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night by Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dares hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Although they had a narrow, but important, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties have fought to maintain momentum, and many of their best known leaders have either moved into exile or sit in dention and await judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded protests on his phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There'll be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who has been awaiting his trial since last year, announced that he would be preparing for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to dispel the setback of democratic values and the subjection we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a car arrived several times in a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened at Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 7.30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may also be an armbrush fired against the car at some point.
Shot from Menga gives Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured victory
The uprisings Livingston overcame Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the league in this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, as they are eight points after, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers' visit to Europe League of Rapid Vienna gets Thursday.
Livingston, in return, expands their undefeated stripe for six games, and Chief Coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of cash stamina
Holt's team should have been ahead of them long before they scored, and their direct playing style created huge problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but handed over across the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse head ahead of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could give the endurance problems in death ball situations.
And it was under the conditions that the important goal came.
Rangers went free park, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the arrangement for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the center of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession but had struggled to get through the home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was forced to rescue Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was abducted with the feet of Rangers goalie Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's death ball situations.
There were regular deliveries into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two demands for a penalty park – after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton's replacement and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenonomic" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Famous effort and strong results for Livingston.
All played amazingly and exceeds expectations of their ascending journey.
Their playing style and trope are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he stepped in.
There were a lot of heroes.
Chief Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the fight.
Rangers lacked yet inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their closures lacked sharpness – only once they got the naked home team – and it is a great wake-up for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cool
There was smile and blue sky Saturday (September 29,) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany that aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disunity has arisen over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, big mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police, for security reasons, held a crowd of 25 000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a lot of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also took note and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat of others.
Accident on the way to Deptford: Cyclist dies in crash by car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a crash with a car whose driver fled the site, on Childreners Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been relocated, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers have been harmed in a high - security prison, according to Prison Office.
There was unrest in the prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 B.C.E. on Sunday, and the turmoil is still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are brought in to deal with the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for less facial damage on site.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "In particular trained prison staff are committed to dealing with the current unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damages.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are resolved that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, rioters were called to prison to deal with serious unrest, where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm floods (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure hits Arizona, but it is most likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the south-west USA and create a risk of storm flood.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about the storm flood for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the border with Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those without risk of storm floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit, because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to American drought surveillance, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa is expected to land on the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and is therefore falling in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical current on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain on parts of Mexico can become powerful and give rise to a great risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm is expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora with a potential of up to 254 mm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona early on Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storm floods and floating falls in the deserts as well as landslides in the hillside.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset report.
Officers have urged all those who may have mobile recordings of the events to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaughh was the subject of the democratic party's "wrath and anger"
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a electoral meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, the anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness explanation in front of the Congress Thursday and strongly denied the sentimental accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually committing herself to her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also made a statement at the hearing on his allegations.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of Republicans attending the mid-term polls.
"In five weeks there will be one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around fighting for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "fight against and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, a person in the Republican party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, death toll growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at the time of foaming, many sucked in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the judge scale.
"When the tsunamitrus arose yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach. They did not immediately run and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the towed cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before the hit coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Destinies continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Board (BPPT) said in an announcement that the energy emitted during Friday's great earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found stuck under the rubble from collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and injuries could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala, located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There lives over 300,000 here," said the Red Cross in an announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
On Saturday the board was criticized from many fronts not to inform them that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time period when the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings shared by social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building that desperately shouts warnings about the tsuamia coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power failure that dispelled communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun sending cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but there is still a great need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's staff from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter during delays installed in the yard at their account. They came past areas with extensive destruction on the way, said Doseba.
"They told me that so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organizations began to work hard to put the aid work back on, complaints arose that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad must come only if the area in which the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open up to international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held fast in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that brighten the dark tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandadi, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how during the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were attending the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one gray fly instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes $26,750 while filling up ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole $26.750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was filling a ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not tell us how many were involved in the incident.
Everyone with information about the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
He announced the shift on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place prior to his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande at the show, which for "emotional reasons," said the show creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier in the year when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and whether the binding line is included.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th year for a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements were raging in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says the investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have issued reports on artificial intelligence, but the United States is still lacking a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, however, introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation within artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognised previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionary could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence must have offered work permits automatically.
The Chinese State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies' distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over USD 100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which seeks to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has remained silent for several months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to achieve membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country towards the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the electorate will represent the 50 % required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot said, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the Yugoslav collapse.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they will comply with the result of the vote and enforce it.
The change of names would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The State Electoral Commission said that no irregularities had been reported at 13 p.m.
However, the electoral participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the country’s name, which would open up to membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje prepared Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small scene and pulled chairs up in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want membership with raised arms, not the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would give a strong boost to investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving their vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "security of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote – less than the required electoral participation.
Another opinion poll made by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 % plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provincial Government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights all over Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 win Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received a drop-off on the middle lane at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran right past three Brighton defenders before he swung out on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boots to override the Brighton goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with her feet," said the City Manager Pep Guardiola reports.
"We talked about him playing around 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
That target came in after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice drop along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before he led Sterling towards the most distant pole.
The Sky Blues forward sprung the ball into the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City fights against Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to occupy the caste on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a chance to participate in the playoffs for Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild-card space with a 5-2 victory over National Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
"Even if we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the game knowingly that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the enough highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet declared the start-up statement for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer into such a situation as a pitcher.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the record for the 34th time, trained his cast Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is located on 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 knitouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans meeting at the polling points at the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big ones – you can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That's why I'm traveling around fighting for amazing candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to get power back with all the resources available, and you can see how vicious they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we don't want to give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have, as a mission, "arrest against and block."
"And you have seen it over the past four days," he said, "and called the Democrats "peaceful and evil and disgusting and lying."
He spoke of the highest democratic senator in the Senate's judicial committee, Diane Feinstein, by name, which triggered the loud bow of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, no, wait – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the last one in a number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome - just because we have made our views known.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship campaign was about criticizing me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In view of the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically enough similar problems to those of Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local parliamentarian, Friday evening meetings have been just like that.
Today the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not so, and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighted as to whether the party's management can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared political views began to expect me to make a turnaround and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or about the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and that does not really matter what I say – I follow a long line of gross messages on the social media that calls for the rejection and opposition of the middle-seeking policy and tells me that I should not be a member of the Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are being addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the willingness of those colleagues who are being overcrowded with sexism or racism every day, but still fight on.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would create a tolerant culture.
In reality, however, it is no longer a spacious organization, and with each motion of censure or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay down on myself and I'm not so loud, I have to "get by."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, who had left our classroom in a declining state, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been a city council member or a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when it comes to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of resignation or political suitability will prevent me from acting on what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr will be top team
Two late scorings may have got the final result to draw a not quite truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of opportunity, which brought home home, and coach Peter Murchie had the absolute right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the battle of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty park just before the half leg. He scored and then got a soloscorning, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, which was followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out out of the course on stretchers. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the jump with a scoring from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Working Ayr leader Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
The home team came again, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the poles and followed up with a more almost after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flute player Gregor Henry off to the home track's fifth scoring.
Still Game-Star on the lookout for new career in the restoration industry
Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it came out that he has taken the director's post for an authorised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person in together with his partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kühr is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Aktriebmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kühr would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the Indian State of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol around the fleet's headquarters, encircled by rains, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
In the whole of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict on resources is still strong, and the same is the longing to sail in the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court on 1 October after five years of vote.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and naturally awaits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Court of Justice in The Hague will inform Bolivia that, after decades of discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot to play on Monday's judgment.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take the party of Bolivia – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has no power to transfer Chilean territory and has determined that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court rejected the judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have set back.
"The story of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' war rhetoric has done it off with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was abnormally swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and benefit both sides," he said.
Mr Calzadilla also refused that Morales, which is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there's no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to respect promises made at a Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments were made in the wake of the apparently relaunch of the sealed nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "wanted dream" that continued sanctions and the US's opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps against disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism over whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted the catwalk veiled for a collection of remarkable extra-large-size headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hat has dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catwalking creations.
The most impressive work from Valentino was an elaborate with a feather-like wide shadow covering the heads of models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled snorkel and masked scuba diving gear, and others resembled a melted wafer ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you're lucky.
Stylspeiders predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The fighting hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeter wide shadow that is seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which is behind the most impractical hatred spread across the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the model showing it.
The orange sauna bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle were the most eye-catching in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitag said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in ordinary stores next summer. The designer has had such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it has continued in 2018 with a number of outstanding exam results, which are even reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, hit that head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it will strike the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of the students received grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as topic choice at the same level as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills carried out in 2014 found that 17 % of the reasons why employers were unable to fill vacancies with language skills were due to lack of skills.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will in the future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a lead to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage of 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you are able to speak more languages, especially those from developing countries, children are better able to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required to achieve success, no matter what the future offers.
At this stage, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in the training.
Modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland's youth.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edward is head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will watch LeBron James play his first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in the opening of Sunday before the start of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet fixed how many minutes he is playing.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is most likely not going to play the whole game.
After the training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
"Where I'm in my career I don't have to fight before the start of the season to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start a stripe election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed Judge for the vacant seat at the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to back up the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish time) night between Saturday November 29th and Sunday November 30th 2018.
You can watch Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely be talking about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, which is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to allegations of sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the primary objective of this series of electoral meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that next week's five electoral meetings aim to "create energy among volunteers and support when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we are entering the busy campaign time," said Reuters, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name.
Tonight's election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to take up the task of giving him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team U.S. has shown combat gestures and tries to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday single duels
After three unilateral rounds of Saturday's four-man duellers, maybe what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least through competitions like this one.
So where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we'll probably see that as momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before he held the four-ft.
Of course, Europe has the advantage; they are four points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel, however, that they have little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud shouts of cheer got higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important well, which secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two blows behind after two duels.
His well that assured them the fight in hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the sort of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength and focus on your own battle," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but sympathetic couples have received four points in four games and appear to be flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a booky Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy apparently floats on both to and from the wild audience shows that it is they who will be the hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were to be captured by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National.
First of all, synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the quadruples when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never near to get out.
Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
The games with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duellers have also shown that Team USA has the battle spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates leadership on 10-6 ahead of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of America of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a busy Tiger Woods and has so far received four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance to foursomes, they won four matches, but they were still behind.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles if they're going to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just another couple in Ryder Cup history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a brave Woods and the American debut Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5/4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant flashes, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's fourballs and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and received a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number three in the world.
Europe, however, is as they want it to be, on a slightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Triple Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a tough 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the single battles. Since Furyks currently have the Cup, however, they only have to achieve indefinite to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will not disarm unilaterally if there is no trust
On Saturday the Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust of the United States and that the country will not unilaterally abandon their nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the general assembly of the worldwide organization that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dispersing an area for nuclear tests and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we will take the first steps and disarm unilaterally."
While While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-divided" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps.
Ri referred to a joint announcement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a seated US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korea War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to bleeding up for tight international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wishful dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the American leader pointed out at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the USA, the negotiations would not be locked down."
Nevertheless, the tone of the Ris speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the launch of North Korea's rockets against mainland America was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on suicide mission.
Last year Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that the sanctions have to remain until North Korea calms down.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a schedule for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, definitive, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased financial sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours after accusing him of making "walking demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile facility as well as an atomic complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent steps", he demanded, were the safety lifts that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study all night kept up by large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
"When the stage was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get this first to know now that I'm at the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve one's academic and sporting performance as well as one's overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dorm room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one's sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep and how important sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, the participants hear about how long - term lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
The participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect your health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking an "all-nighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on the students have caused sleep deprivation to be a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even discourages weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped last year Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses at his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course at the entire university.
He hopes that the next thing will be that all graduates are offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to go to bed. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can move at the diurnal rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered yet another defeat on the field, when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's uncooperative team had to go to Thanks to a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out after their first win on the field since the 4-1st Triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the only second defeat in 18 matches as a coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts on the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond.
Rangers now go down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up a third place after Hibernian with only the goal score to difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as line judges Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a tossed object, which seemed to come from the open-air section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the setup that reached Betfed Cups semifinale by toning past Ayr.
However, Holt set out with the same 11, who shaved a point of Hearts' lead last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents across the track.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes inside the game when Menga's first delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt was over.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked his ass past the rear pole.
Rangers, however, took control, but played more hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was at least not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson recognized the Colombian appeals about the penitentiary when he and Steven Lawless broke together after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head impact and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Even though Livis's opening in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said to be worthy of their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't deal with a death ball situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga who could easily kick it in.
During the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave a paw when the flute player sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the final part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with sure hand before Lithgow lifted next to the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty park after being dried with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way.
Yearbook: Inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morgen": On September 30th, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELLER... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the device known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a permanent component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado" film, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the leading role as a peasant scientist:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals does."
Evans: "Stop it, now it's on!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he wanted to fill 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are re-injected
A test vaccine is a promising vaccine in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "gets several cancers to develop", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was deflected when he hailed the US President Donald Trump and said that he himself would stand up as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After playing this evening's third song Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again case, he began a thundering speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's racist?'
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have long since left the United States," he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's judicial committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the recordings were not shown, the comedian Chris Rock West's teased on the social media.
It's not certain if Rock tried to show West by setting up the tapes.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of her headwear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't wear that hat out there."
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deep," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I am sunk?" and said that he would take on his Superman cap because it means that "you can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience gave at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, says Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was bombing in the studio."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: TAKE NOT TO LADE YOU OF THE PUBLISH."
Talkshow bet Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and it's fine."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art"), who embraces and exudes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed to.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he has taken the name change to the "entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapkolla Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Appeal for attempted murder on a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday at a restaurant in Eastern Belfast.

The intentions are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longing for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs out after the stereotypical macho-hero and says that this kind of TV character means that young men often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he felt that "something has gone wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently got married to his Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem is "very much on his mind".
"At the moment, it's very important to me – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculineity due to the very masculine characteristics.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is nourished?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the streets that make them feel like men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he would not make successors to the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer and said that he is "complete with battlefields and horses".
Kit is involved from November in a re-recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygrette as Kit's character, Jon Snow, fell in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
Much of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with other men marry sooner or later because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are caused by a lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data about Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied on Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The democracy of Los Angeles claimed that the allegations originated from websites and supported "the extreme right wing".
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies," wrote the Waters in a Twitter posting.
The published information contained allegedly home addresses and phone numbers of the American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday on the Internet by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate dealing with allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as the Gateway Poundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of the Waters staff, The Hill writes.
"This unfounded accusation is totally untrue and a direct lie," Waters continued.
"The inclusion of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false charges, is by no means responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is totally untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' release quickly got criticism online, including from former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, you can't get angry.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the critics of the Democrats of Kavanaugh, who were criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also made his opinion known on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official announcement she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the powers of order regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We want to ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – overwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British ice cream, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the new export potential of the country become dry, sarcastic, self-satious, about how difficult it is for us?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have got his permission to make the brewers renewed again-again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the humiliated secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and duly clattered by him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of the Fire song at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international lukewarm pants that left chaos in his wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this recent shot on the tribe of JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval suit, and the propellers ringed against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor is quite underscoring and strangely superfluous, especially now that more "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impressible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as ingenious and focused as Atkinson's silent movie foolleries in the role as Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a prime minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it is the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a high-class school, but who in secret teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for a kind of school of rock education in espionage.
English hastened back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hard tried previous right hand Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough has now become married to an over-enthusiast but well-meaning submarine captain – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the kingly intelligence service's all-round Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is intriguing close to getting involved with the charismatic and creepy tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: Dressed as servants, they set fire to an excellent French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnaroch as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the closing sequence of the film, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of children's television.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't help but think with the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does his talent justice?
Labour refuses to barsle with four-day working week plan with unchanged pay for the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can only spend a four-day working week, but get paid for five.
The party will allegedly have managers to use their artificial intelligence (AI) savings to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have three days of weekend without losing their salary.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not unanimously supported in the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to withdraw power from "anonymous directors" and "exploit" in utilities.
The shadow finance minister's plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the forefront could "abstain" them from immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to have employees in company boards and to set up including owner funds, which would allocate 10 per cent of the private company's share value to employees who would receive up to £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their vote
The FBI investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig out something that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came up – and I said, "Did you?"
He was steel set, definite and unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to have been chiselled in stone.
"I've decided with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it had to change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is a host city for the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end world poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park's large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will attract attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that is struggling to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertians need to perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful action that can draw attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – i.e. that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter posting?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to set binding targets and policy measures equivalent to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 objectives and actions that had become due to their actions, which amounted to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong individuals. They strive to "help children experience their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to address nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now promised funds to improve the nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In answer to one of the website's frequently asked questions, saying: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the movements towards apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy sports, says the US Secretary of State for the Interior
"If necessary," Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, exposing the US Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria – especially where they operate on invitation from the legitimate government – is a pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And according to him, there are methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States, with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage by sea and, if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization that regards itself as "the voice of the US energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are basically the same.
"The economic opportunities vis-à-vis Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These opinions come after the Trump administration has been aiming to increase European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, speakers for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which according to Trump has made Berlin the "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said the Russian Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said the head of the BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator from Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential elections after the mid-term elections, she said on Saturday.
At a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering setting up.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I would like to give strong consideration to the presidential election."
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump to the City Council and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing about our democracy," she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Friday, on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI will have to investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday opinion poll shows that the majority of Warren's own backland does not believe that she should set up in 2020.
According to a poll of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32 % supported the potential candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% and 48% against a possible stand-up.
Other high-profile democratic candidates discussed in the presidential elections in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Bid states that he announces his final decision in January, writes the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through after he gets home, makes me relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return home with," she told the audience at a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for the "elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think whether there is respect for that, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the notification of domestic violence and to be in possession of a drunken weapon, says Dan Bennet, a spokesperson for the Wasillas police.
18 states and D.C. supports opposition to new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law that refuses asylum for victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and D.C. delivered on Friday in Washington a party-dependent statement in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The applicant's full name in the case Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but American officials refused her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers come, as countries with extensive problems of domestic gangs and violence.
The new U.S. asylum legislation overturned a decision by the U.S. Foreign Assembly in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia's state attorney, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "regards decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against the principle," states the party-dependent declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejection of immigrants harms the American economy, as it is more likely that they will become independent and "provide the necessary labour."
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions removed the right of immigration judges to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standing," said Sessions in its announcement of the law of 11 June.
It has never been intended that asylum should solve all problems – or just all serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
While the death rate doubles, the attempts will be to find survivors in Palu desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling her little feverish boy at an evacuation center in the ruined town of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance comes in with dead bodies.
We need clean water."
The residents now returned to their ruined home to sort in soaked possessions and to save what they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals, also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to follow.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes when he told him how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was masturbated against a broken wall, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and added that his family was going to the wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of infinite methods and propaganda ads
One week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American newspaper that drummed for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the American ambassador in China blames Beijing for using the US press to spread propaganda.
The US president, Donald Trump, referred on Wednesday to China Dailys paid for entry into Des Moines Register – Iova's best selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in November 6th Congress elections. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war where they have imposed customs duties on each other's imports in several ways.
China’s reprisals in the trade war were to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican party, believed Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China, former Governor for a few years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a director of the Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "obtains the use of the infinite methods of running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, there will be only a few disagreements. And you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people towards China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under tight control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women prior to the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warn analysts
While many top republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the coming mid-election, especially from women.
The case has put the emotions in the boil, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be undone," said Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) request for an FBI investigation in 11 hours will soften anger voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill this Friday.
Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrators shouted: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation are coming to a new height," said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say it has already reached a high level; it is right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29 years of age – who rarely vote, despite not being able to like the president."
Even before Ford's public accusations of the Supreme Court's sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that if Republicans continued to nominate, it could be a failure.
"It has become a worse root for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final result, or about Kavanaugh being held responsible; it's also about how the Republicans handled it here and how they treated her," points Guy Cecil, president of the United States of America – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have divided positions as to who they should believe in after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new opinion from YouGov shows that 41% of those polled either definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying under his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's appeal, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another one, writes Deborah Ramirez to The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee last week that Kavanaughh fully committed suicide when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominated her for a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company joked Berner's Lee that the plan for Inrupt is "dominance of the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's managing director, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to pool resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps using the available tools on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely so that all their business models suddenly become redundant."
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a headline on Medium last Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The spiritual recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I is hailed
The only priest of England who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I will be celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, under the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning activity.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 through a very thick mist and under heavy fire from machine gun and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people with the "greatest man's courage" before only attacking an artillery and harmlessly made three cannons.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann at 72 said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to join the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but got instead Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night watching the star-spangled Bellator 206 and then being denied to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown through the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for this particular fight.
A fan at Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Grisen Gurli, yes."
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said that they will work to include English viewers in the planning ahead.
"When thinking about the re-dispatching, I think we can make it work," Coker said.
"But the clock is six Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when a change was made, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We only have five games instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had a "minor" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt worth less than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't happen to him until he got into the bigger classes, that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope."
He also said that he was less inclined to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the radio program that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
Daley was a guest in Lavere's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his childhood, because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "From today, the feelings of memory and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high profile LGBT champion and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The three-way world champion said that he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through as much as young – he went to his first OL at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed."
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets to London in 2012 – when he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 OL and won the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the opening of the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mikkelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson records on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who records for the 12th time to be in the competition, which is held every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Fury because of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the events of the United States as usual, the five - doubled Grand Winner had to act as a cheerleader and practice at his game in the hope of fixing his face.
Even at the height of his career he had the most direct drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the track at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes the wild shots.
And if the track was not large enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet the always accurate winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, starting the 12 single games, start off fast, Mickelson's fight can be decisive.
Fury did not express surprising faith in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a slap on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd be playing two games.
I thought he was gonna play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it was supposed to be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldos beats the record for most games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite been able to measure itself with his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven drawdowns, even though Fury said that his presence contributes with something infinitable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the holding room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cup single-tracking can quickly become annoying.
The Danes debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just about to be caught before the finish line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna be full in the morning.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it is trying to win the trophy, and that is where our focus lies.
I have always said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Satisfied at his players' performance on a difficult track, Bjørn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that count, and it is something quite different.
It's great to be out there with a partner, when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you'll be tested on all the parameters as a golfer.
That's what players need to understand – bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he's also going to get the best out of himself."
Otherwise, it looks to opponent Jim Furik who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fury himself has experienced conversations last day. First on the winner team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miraclet of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as one saw at Brookline, as one saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the midfields.
We put our team together in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel for. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead backwards and facing Rory McIlroy in the top battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
The new warship of Germany is being postponed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans have to wait for at least one year due to technical problems and an escalating price, writing local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first six months of 2019 according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have become part of the fleet in 2014, but after-sale problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the ageing frigates from the Bremen class.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: It should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear to be an overseas power force – will already be obsolete when they are deployed, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125-fregat created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" that made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software error was of particular importance as the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – it is only half of that crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was far too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the possibility of future updates by the fleet.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" are said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failure, the price of the project, which includes training the crew, is also by becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleeting force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running out of ready-to-emission ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Snipers for the Secret Life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eyed bats and waterflagmus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record bat activities during the season.
Data are also collected from NTS personnel and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show which type does what.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Natural conservation consultant for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and Great Britain has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban extension projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. Also can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
The NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the area around Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The caretaker of the area, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is a lot you don't know about bats, so the work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before making maintenance tasks on property, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, thereby risk destroying an entire local population.
Bats are saved and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or their shipowner.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bat, and too many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape while lawyers sue German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are prepared to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It claims that he paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, wrote Der Spiegel last Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have called, according to Reuters, "an unforgivable publication of suspicions of privacy."
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class equivalent to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly took back to the player’s room where he must have raped her anal according to the report filed in Clark County City Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "one percent".
The case papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to reverse the agreement because she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a change from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event was due to take place, and this summer changed to the Italian major club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever", if it lost its status as leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily lower production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
Clark said, "We need a deal."
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March," said the Managing Director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is to deal with the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a withdrawal without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, said the company.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "compositioned, so that they are precisely avoided at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The opinions of Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we have to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again."
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed for a week more", as the verdict of the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over the shoulder during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, links between Trump's helpers and Russia and the president's possible obstacle to the course of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thus risk Mueller's independence has been a matter of gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein considered wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the opportunity to dismiss the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor went that he would quit.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, had to testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is no set date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed for a week with everything going on in Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to the TV journalists' game for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they're playing up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source, "We've looked at the figures."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "If the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to make it a great opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health contacts EU healthcare staff after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, and it appears that decisions are expected to be taken in the autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for a possibly Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts that each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from outside and outside the EU have valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system to the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after primary injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was urgently operated after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports from Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the event took place before the break.
"He went to the sidelines and just fell out there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and took him into further investigation.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombies operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are not "any details of the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he suffered the damage.
Abercrombie studies in the second year and is on her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five strikes on Saturday before he left the game, giving him 18 strikes this season.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp fee when they buy houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp fee when they buy a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the conservative party, must help the homeless.
This move must dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamping fee when they buy properties in the UK for the benefit of the homeless.
The draw will be seen as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after them with the highest income.
The rise in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The additional fee, which is added above the current stamping fee and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent may reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 % of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become " ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp tax in order to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don't use. He asked May to drop quotas on cheap homes to solve the UK's 'bad housing situation'.
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching series of housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the withdrawal of the lessor's opportunity to put people on the street if they comply with the lease contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my Presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as for hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become a coach in Scotland"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become the coach of Scotland.
The 42-shot enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East Club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking for St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always drawn me.
But that possibility would only arise if I was successful in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as a trainer for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says that he had no worries about following such established names in such a big club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success from if 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs at home in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll only see myself as a success here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in career as a coach after a period of assisting training at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to come back after being jerked down in the third row and transformed St Mirren from the rush to the title winner for the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkyrk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I guess it was a proper way of separation," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought that training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, served wisely, and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you're going through on a weekly basis.
There is still such stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't been more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., shows survey
The heat wave this summer has increased the performance of England's pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
The sale of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have dropped by 4.8%, showing figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who has collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long World Cup have meant that July follows the June pattern, where the pubs experienced more sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Publishers and bars focused on the sale of beverages clearly managed the best and experienced progress similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pupper with focus on food in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages rose by 6.6% a month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, analysing the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, the weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still struggling, even though a decrease in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt over rising costs.
The long, warm summer couldn't come at a worse time for the food industry, and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will give a hard-pressed breathing room."
The overall increase in sales for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, indicating the decrease in newly started fires.

Every five children have a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Every five children – down to 11 years of age – have secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, show investigation.
A study of 20,000 school students in grade 4-9 reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being put up
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
Every five children all the way down to 11 years create accounts on the social media they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the fourth grade reveals massive growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being put up.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, then a teenager who urged others to "violate me".
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to have private accounts.
The manager of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is scary that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the athletes' vote" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as the Executive Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great prestige in the athletic world of Scotland, Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics of Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the athlete's voice, and I hope that I can contribute and help set out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of its four OL gold medals in the 200 and 400 meter races at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and who are now often commentators for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote, "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show whether I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am perfectly healthy, have learned to walk again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for chest pump comparing mothers with cows gets mixed reception online
A breast-pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-fed mothers to cows that milk.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement that should show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a bowl full of hay for a song in which it says, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't too much, it's my boobs."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I'll feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I'll milk my bosom."
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has got a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "reds" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.

Another wrote: "I can understand enough traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What an insensitive advertising."
Others defended the advertising, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievably funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd have had one.
Breast-feeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like 'buyers'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breast-bh, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom the new pump can give."
This is not the first time that the pump from Elvie has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border guards has not changed. This is partly due to a tougher rhetoric and Trump administration’s tougher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who were seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had pure criminal records.
"Aside from 80% of those who are sponsors or members of sponsors' households, they are illegally staying in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people," said Albence.
In the attempt to deal more quickly with children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of even meeting up and talking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those judged to be unjustified shall be deported promptly.
The longer children stay in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression that can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts, it says from relief workers and from reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep an eye on the suffering of a child.
They added that emigration to a tent village without mental preparation or the possibility of saying goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria informs US, French and Turkish "employees" that they must withdraw immediately
When the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces' residence in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they "will be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "nearly is over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared up all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "extending unjustified fear", which caused the refugees to disappear.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these repatriations," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that assistance will not be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Because of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, was avoided against the province, where three million live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would go after the jihadists from the Nusra Front, a leader group of Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
The United Nations Mission Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new committee in order to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for an election.
Moualem has placed conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee and states that the work of the panel must be limited to "to review the legislation of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.
Based on the logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the Supreme Court case and scandals end his pre-emptive term, which many liberal viewers may hope for.
Undoubtedly, in what will be "The most dramatic end of a presidential term ever!"
There is currently no sign of vision fatigue.
Since 2014, the best time of transmission has almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million in the evenings with big news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the director of the ABC-drama Designated Survivor about a head of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a rate in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' said Scovell.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But contrary to all other television programs, the stories coming from Washington can decide between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged admired.
And yet it's more than being an enlightened citizen when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's ostrich jacket at $15,000 ("clothed with hybrids", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's vivid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"Something that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotating crew of the Trump show and daily surprises (damaging with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC, while he recorded CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows before, and people said, 'It's the beginning at the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find their way to the close midway elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two "Congressional Districts", two Congressional Districts are fighting for the same seat.
This recently converted suburban district of Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special elections last spring.
Lamb stands up against another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17.
The maps were restated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in January that the old district was illegally placed in the favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has launched a fight for financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a March election with high alertness for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been on Republicans' hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with a few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump's management team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to call the leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, Foreign Minister's spokeswoman in an announcement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador was punished. They received about $140 million of the United States in 2017 to include drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties proposed, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on admission permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials set out a summit on security and economic development, which should continue to hold last year's meeting, which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in the middle of September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway and thus dropped the consideration of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to send a signal of the importance that the Americans attach to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American publishers secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who is close to the administration and who also spoke out of a condition of anonymity.
Known History
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, for which there are considerable and publicly available evidence.
It is reported that Mueller will also direct his investigation into the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
Should Congress come on new hands, Trump will likely be held accountable while preparing to meet the voters again and, of course, in time a jury of his fellows.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's finality is inevitable – and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to put in a coup against Hitler, if only the West could have resisted him by supporting the Chechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the long bloodbath thereafter.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning, and the inestimable march of democracy is taking hold.
In the United States there are now several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is imprecise.
"How do we react if the F.B.I.'s recently sought investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is cancelled or not properly implemented – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote for the mid-election vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied the home country of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away 60 years later to light up the Sabbath lights on the table with the crossbow.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers go on Thursday towards SK Rapid Vienna. After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have good opportunities with a victory against the Austrians to move on from group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting the seasonal debut before the 2-2 fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could've taken the stabs home, but all in all that was probably a fair result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we got out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in last match. But with the audience behind us I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, there were only a few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in Nationswide’s study reported that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% told me they were talking to their kids about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not tell them about your wishes in good time.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices may be crucial factors for costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the economy for it.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal battles in the race.
Get a proxy so that you can get an entrusted person to handle your medical treatment and ensure that doctors and medical staff comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic authority.
If so, you will appoint an trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who's looking after the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in the 40's and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 02.30, as "incidentally random."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami which hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency relief workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 persons were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sudanese province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a government that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the Central Sudanese economy, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala, according to Indonesia’s disaster centre, have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was hit again by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically on the so-called fervor of the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and not until April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake that measured 6.8, struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that broke down the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the town of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake that measured 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya government in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son was charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, preventing the notification of domestic violence, and to oppose arrest, according to the report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a security deposit of $500, reports KTUU.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, where he declared himself "not entirely guilty," reports the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A crimes, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can lead to a single day's punishment in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently pending at Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing the notification of a violent crime at home and the possession of weapons in affected condition in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after explaining his son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of Central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are circulating videos that show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu when the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC convicted of the rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to sentence the death penalty to Sayvollo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people – a rare punishment that was finally convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to perform an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were slaughtered.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the Declaration of intent on capital punishment in New York's southern district.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these intentions.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov for a trial of 22 points, including eight allegations of murder in gangsters, typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "extensive planning and preparation," said the prosecutors and described Saipov's performance as "impressive, malicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, physical injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last brought charges against a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder of two suppliers of drugs but ended up in life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was recently imposed in a state case in New York in 1953. Then the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no signs of regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was doing well.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung up in his hospital room, and the officers told me.
He has refused to take charge of the 22 counts of the prosecution.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the charges not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the public army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be "marked" by the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The private Conservative MEP Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have been "out now" whose Farage had been the Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge in relation to bringing together the deeply divided party is emphasized by the fact that conservative remainers participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks by both the Brexites, the Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that, despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leaf in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrape the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister from Wellingborough added, "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we're going to scrape Chequers."
Concerning the background to his European opposition, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the fact that the public's position should have changed since the 2016 vote: "The British people should have changed their minds and would like to remain in the European Union is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now drop Chequers and start listening."
As a pointed remark to May, she added: "Premier Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the procession that politicians should be able to "mark the press" if they fail to vote in 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They'll betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You have to make sure that the political class who is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army here in the country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud Britain."
While marching remainers through Birmingham before a totims marched into the city center.
Scattered activists waved with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis made a mockery of the security problems with the Conservative party app before the meeting.
"It is the people who claim to have access to the IT systems and technology of Canada, to border controls, to free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's all a joke.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly preparing for the presidential elections" after the mid-election in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts democrats talked about his future at a town council meeting on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will in November try to re-elect the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
You've wondered if she'd challenge Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the town hall, since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to stand up for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time that "women go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front."
Arrest in case of shots at LSU's Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday at an ET news meeting at 11.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help to identify a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of the injuries," said Sheriff Murphy J. Paul, according to the medium 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to be present, possessing a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in custody of the East Baton Rouge District police.
Sims was a two meter high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started inside ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a decisive role in the race.
From the driver's position Bothas got off to a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton completely off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first, leaving Hamilton to fight the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes car went into pit a bit later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when, after some wheel contact, the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to leave the inner lane after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstapp started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that he led a large part of the race when, in an attempt at a rapid closure, he failed to change the deck to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go to pit at 44th round, but couldn't speed up the last eight rounds, so the Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Valtteri made it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job to secure both the first and the second place," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sex abuse.
At an electoral meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that events in the Senate showed that people were "bad and ugly and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who licked it?
Remember her answer... it was you who leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter on Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's election session: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president's continued defense of the nominee to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They don't spend any money trying to take power back.
You can see the wickedness, the abominations, they don't care who they have to drum to gain power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did well again after Friday's lost Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants came forward quickly with two targets of attack by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled down on the runway before Dwyer again brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals more.
It was the third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's team that came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in the Friday's fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides where Giants went out as victors in the three previous matches.
Dwyer spent the fourth minute on 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assist, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as completely after he died in order to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers came safely down to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake last Friday, the Sulawesi Island hit and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even though Mr Anthonius Gunawan Agung's 21-year-old colleagues escaped from life, he refused to leave his seat in the floating control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed back in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway, got safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll can reach thousands, and the country's emergency response informs that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death rate is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to get to them," said the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet [6 m] high waves have destroyed Palu, who is carrying out a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in relief and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with several bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the stores have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are getting into.
It is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to perform all the tasks of evacuation.
You guys ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year when more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini is now saying that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though he had previously announced that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for further information on passengers, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had gone to the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers stayed in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed on very low water.
"That was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go into water for life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew panicked and yelled and that he had suffered minor damage.
The American Navy said that sailors working to renovate a quay nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines during the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyses determine the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor completed his evidence on Saturday under the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave several hours of testimony as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teledata to merge the progress of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed that he, together with his friend Michael Sanford, visited the police at Sanford.
Sanford sat in the stand on Saturday and told him he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "stupid because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile data showed that they had known each other for only one week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is planned to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that same day.
The High Breed: What is political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They want to return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Babysitting in New York City is suing couples for firing with "racist" text messages
A nanny in New York is suing a couple of discriminatory firings after receiving a text message from a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racist, but compared the case with "depressive".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is the mother of two, expressed his horror at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEY, DO NOT END A SORTH PERSON," wrote the Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she would send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad for her work, and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the firing and compensation for 350 dollars a day in the six months when she should have lived with the family, even if this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't afford to do something like this," she said to the Friday newspaper and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone to whom you had been unhurried, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with "depression" and that his wife had been born two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really going after someone like that?
It is not very kind," added the investment adviser.
Although the trial is still in progress, the People's Court has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that the readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's quite fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small clothing bear, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th year of the publication of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: You are proud of them, even though it is not really your profit.
I think a little bit he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Said goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing her daughter was driven to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart going slowly lost its effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperous went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving Women Try to Stop Suicide Shoprs
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he had a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with a infected smile.
"His smile was known by all.
People said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him when he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there's someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your own thoughts – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-standing girlfriend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about him being sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact at all with them."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear, while the FBI is starting investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time study – we could perhaps get some agreement," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "falling from the hind" in the middle of the locked party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI do their research?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the highest judicial office in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him as Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean skippers 'falls' during Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean deportees to South Korea has fallen, since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-zeug referred to data from the South Korea Ministry of Coalition and said that there were 1,127 dropouts last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human trafficking were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang hasn't made any official comments.
The vast majority of deputies from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
The government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border approaching North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China sees the hopes as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, so that they are often forced to come home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has improved markedly over the past few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea on an overall level.
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is ruled out that we will disarm ourselves," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is unsuitable for the Supreme Court
The head of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Supreme Court judge, "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, they would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the sentimental accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also denounced the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "Greek and coordinated characterism" arranged by the left wing, angered that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself from the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went outside when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say that if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly in the court he's in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, preconceived person must contest a job as judge and expect us to say 'yes, it is not just great'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a fair outcome, the anger of several months and years that is raging, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I received great support from a woman who was a boss who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she spoke to: "You might think I am sorry for my crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permitted as an expression of anger, partly because they are misinterpreted in substance.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by an elderly woman – a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll take care that they got on you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Colorado Congress of Democrats, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed in having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and resigned as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could as well stand up herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a particularly thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind fundraising, so she promised she would not participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a talk about not wanting to stop, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she had a lump in her throat.
"You could think I got a nervous breakdown," Schroeder reminded her of how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
That way, the trade war between the United States and China can be an advantage to Beijing
The opening ointments in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, divide between countries can be an advantage to Beijing in the long run, say experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese export products, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The greatest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion is, in principle, half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Every time Beijing has returned, at the latest by imposing customs duties of 5-10 % on US goods for USD 60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world’s second largest economy probably does not exist at the moment.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means that they give in, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it will be far too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards properly, the US trade war pressure can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A speedy decision in either Washington or Beijing can create groundwork for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than one thought," said Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, believes Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for refugees to return and asks for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now in place to enable refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries which helped to support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe gained the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on pairs 3 at the 16th hole, which made him lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have got 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5/4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do for it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really glad to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort, and I'm glad I could help," said one emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He forwards the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who fell the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in a single match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a joke statistics for one of the best golfers ever who's won 14 big titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had trouble finding the form all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Fury, said after his team's disappointing show, "I'm proud of the guys, because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe countermeasures.
We lost.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we will move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
