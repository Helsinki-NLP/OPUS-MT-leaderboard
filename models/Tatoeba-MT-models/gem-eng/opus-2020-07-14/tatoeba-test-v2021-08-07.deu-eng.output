The main task of the kings was to set up a tomb of which one thought it would seem as timeless as the stars would be over the sand of the time, in which otherwise everything would sink. The planning of the afterlife was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led them to remember in the walls of this tomb, in which the stone was carved the scenes. Certainly much was beautified, and in later times even battles were presented that had not taken place at all.
