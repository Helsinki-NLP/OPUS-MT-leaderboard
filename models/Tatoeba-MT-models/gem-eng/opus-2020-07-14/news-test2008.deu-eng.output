Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the eurozone was the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, prices were higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were based on only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leitzens in contrast to the American, British, and Canadian banks. Its discretion would favour the rise in raw material prices and the slight decline in unemployment, which would favour the emergence of a spiral of inflation.
The ECB seeks to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is located in the Zwickmühle: inflation has to be "absorbed" in order to exclude subsequent needs for action.
At 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve-year record high; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The increase in inflation in the euro area was responsible for increasing food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans has also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products were also very expensive in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but in 2009 it is estimated that it will decrease to 1.9 percent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts assume a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts estimate that the ECB will reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Location Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the Socialists, according to Gallup, have reached an unprecedented trough of 13 percent.
In the case of party-favored voters, the difference is clear thanks to the strong determination of the opposition advocates: More than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) vote for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry gate: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic sentiment has worsened further - never before was the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "very bad" so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "reasonably bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is expected to be improved.
A Gallup survey carried out in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historical high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "very bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proponents for Viktor Orbán represent 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could also be tackled without change of government.
If, after the unrest of last October, 35% had spoken out for the government and the head of government, this figure is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) see the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty" and another 20% would "probably" give their vote.
For comparison: if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns with certainty, another 15% would think their participation "probably". Given these tendencies, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would be against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital daily allowance.
Applied to the group participating in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Again most expensive, Tesco increases by almost one-fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser commercial triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1,000 HUF were recorded.
After prices in the food markets have been "approached" in last December, prices have not been significantly reduced by percentage, compared with the already high level of previous prices.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they had paid for in the last year is far below 9,000 HUF not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, but the prices for powder breast fillets, walnuts and poppy have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg of breadweeks for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive fall in the price of the product to less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola pan bottle of less than 200 forint, thus costing the drink including a deposit only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year cut in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Also the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest off.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" basket compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Ochtan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of today was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1,206,00 Forint in the previous year, but the increase in VAT was noticeable at the prices of last Christmas.
This is precisely the process that has affected trade: apparently the department stores could not quite decide which price range they should apply to the individual articles, as the impact of the price increase on consumption was unpredictable.
(If the dealer is planning poorly the rate of circulation of a product, it can be significant gains in the price range which is based on traffic intensity.)
Last year's "Napi" shopping cart cost-value-relatedly, it was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the 2006 value by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference at the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost more at 1.630,00 Forint than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was observed, the price of the daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic food, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 percent price over the period of 12 months.
So in about beside flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" basket, this seems almost impossible at the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has risen by barely more than 10 percent in the worst case case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the suppliers - at least they were able to turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden commercial triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets across the loading tables.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes at the cash desk in all three warehouses, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain about the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals that have been caused by improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overburdening of the beds, the overburdening of the staff - all factors that are incompatible with the control of the infections, as the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places the disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalised after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation could not be performed due to the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
Until 10 December this year, multi-resistant pathogen infections were reported from hospitals in 1094 to the National Nosocomomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark digit should be higher.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in its nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, inflammation of the tonsils, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the substances are too high or incorrectly applied, they are derived from the well-responsive bacteria antibiotics-resistant, which spread rapidly in the hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poor immune system, but also in elderly, or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. Sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital everyday life.
You shouldn't confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA only doesn't exist where she's not being searched.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics needed for treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for the control of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Bröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospitals should investigate the patients in question and isolate MRSA-infected immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practised so often.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation from the State health insurance fund.
Therefore, most cases would only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, says the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the European Union side, there are strict recommendations on the relevant use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and pathogens.
Antibiotics should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary in order to avoid resistance to the drug, but these directives are not always complied with by hospitals.
Among the outpatients, or patients in the basic care, microbiological samples were even more rare, says Karolina Bröócz.
Save in the disinfectants
Scientific evidence that MRSA is most commonly transferred from one patient to another by the caregiver.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks are of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection or contact, but in the local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are closely intertwined, although there should be an epidemiological distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Börócz further notes, unfortunately, in the less financially well-established hospitals it is even apparent that disinfectants are being spared, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that can actually favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Bröócz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in control causes the health insurance enormous costs, therefore they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
After first signs the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Head of the Death Lender Police was not drunk.
In the case of fatal car accidents caused by police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest State Attorney General on Friday after the official report was presented on the case.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police chief booked his own car in the XXII. District into Kossuth Lajos Straße and crossed a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked location.
(But this is not a milding circumstance for StVO - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra stripe, aftergang.)
The pedestrian has suffered his injuries after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then withdrew his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday, amounting to EUR 400 million in total, to be spent on education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved a EUR 300 million framework in 2006 for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also intended to be devoted to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will later be decided in the framework of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly take place in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The metro line 4 was also available at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary clarified the details of the underground financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The interest on loans is EURIBOR-bound, the loan will be made available free of commission by the EIB with a suspension of 8 years.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is paying attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, but which is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most sought after patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun-coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessbar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will also attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the excellently affordable area of Russians, more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office areas offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradise, thus attracting tourists in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foreseeing investors are therefore already buying in a big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties of 50 to 100,000 euros, or come down houses of 5 to 15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive due to the ever-increasing demand.
Although real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria within the EU, prices have increased by 21 per cent per year over the past five years.
The cost of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are advising on Bali's roadmap, which sets out emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is now a heated debate between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate specific figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue at the conference is whether the industrialized countries are ready to support developing countries financially, as well as technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on support for developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary’s 6 per cent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by the 1990 values), regardless of whether the "after 2012 agreement" was successful, or not. The Union would even be willing to commit itself to a 30% reduction, provided other major industrial countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to comply with their obligations by force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8% with its 15 Member States at that time.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly come into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, which also highlighted the importance of the IPCC, the International Nobel Peace Prize (IPCC), the UN Scientific Committee on Climate Change in its recent report.
This would delay emission reduction, and the increase in Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army Presses YouTube
Units of the British Army have published photographs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos to the network since March 2006 about operations conducted against the Taliban, reports the BBC.
The miniature cameras mounted on helmets are controlled at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defencehead quarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such kind of published propaganda was almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message in themselves, confirming the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
U.S. Basket with Game
However, the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, besides the carefully processed, censored recordings, also create the net - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken of at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war sites in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, many filmed videos have already been loaded onto the platform, but this "watch" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise in the somewhat different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-like simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mondika Lamperth is by no means quirky: Instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a work conference in which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magical Christmas atmosphere with Tombola or incitement to the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already registered the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the defence resort, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of the Orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Party" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort makes about 25 million available for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NMO) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport hit the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint's expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, it is expected to accommodate about 350 of the 600 employees.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live-acts and tombola-release.
The National Agency for Development (NFMO) held its 4.7 million Forint-priced Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rental was 1 million forint and the rest was spent on more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFCU is also invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the authorities.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFCU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
Upon request from [origo] one told: There was no mandatory dress or suit at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Work, and Self-Government are preparing themselves for puritan celebrations.
The Health Ministry organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Mondika Lamperth officially invites her employees not at all to a Christmas celebration, but to the annual conference.
You expect about 180 guests, who - the press department - only host coffee and pogates, so the celebration with 350,000 forint ends.
Self-Government Minister Gordon Bajnai will be starting with his colleagues just in the department's aula.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 forint per head - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incitement.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the employees of the PM have been celebrating in this way each year.
However, there will not be a real party-stimulation - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the party was appointed for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year reception on 20 January, the Ministry's Christmas celebration is due this time.
The one hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"), according to the information of the resort the editions are measured with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally start with a short speech from the minister and sound with restraining mutilation.
As the respective press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebrations at either the foreign or the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the costs of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the ceremony at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation shall form their coordination committee for the indefinite duration of Monday's strike.
On Saturday a large protest assembly is held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum to the Health Insurance Act - the downturn of work begins.
It is expected to have a strike-related, significant traffic handicap, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport services (BKV) are also on strike until 13.00.
Details of the strike on Monday are announced jointly by the league unions and the union federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also established, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly is held, and on Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will lay down their work for an indefinite period, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike started on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees meet to discuss the further action.
Because of the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even possible that it will be voted on the Health Insurance Act only in the later evenings, or even at midnight.
The strike that starts on Monday will have to be expected with considerable roadblocks: the railways will lay down their work for an indefinite period, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will stand still.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks in many places in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is updated continuously on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others plan temporary job losses.
Until Thursday afternoon, there has been no agreement on sufficient performance between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZZZ, although more and more people are on the way by train right around the holiday of Christmas.
According to previous reports, the BKV will work from start-up to 3 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, i.e. the Democratic Teachers' Union, have called for two or two or eight hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is striking nationwide ageing at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for the Cooperation of Trade Unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Question No 3 states that the eligible professional groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that VDSZZ, a member of the league trade unions, did not accept the annexation related to the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases State risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division), the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "movement for a better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "risk warning report" states: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancement of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic confrontations in the short term".
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard strategy, which is probably aimed at provocation of such a conflict, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built up their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary gender".
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have been significantly damaged, not least thanks to the enormous attention given by the local and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since autumn 2006 the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been constantly under way, so that since summer 2007 several organisations called "national self-defence society" have been established.
"These groups are meant to define themselves as civil organizations, while openly boasting of preparing their members - sometimes armed - for defence tasks (disaster protection, state defence, order-keeping), calling for the inability of the police, army, or state itself," it said.
And further: all this happens in accordance with that method, which tries to seduce various political aspirations, based on the political and party perversion of the population, as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is not merely on the circumvention of legal hurdles that may arise in the course of the registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis can be seen, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-raising factor for relations with neighbouring countries as well.
"In recent months, Hungarian Guards have been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultra-nationalist politicians from certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policy in the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - said it.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose founding was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the birth of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass excavatings that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately to the occasion of the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the objective of the organisation of "national protection" is.
In your opinion, over the past 17 years, there has been a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inextricably and indistinct - according to the Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have started a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats with the organisation of their own protection, says the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said on request from the News Office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changing trends identified, the public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
Holidays in Hungary are precisely regulated by law, so that the practice of redeploying the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year gives us fewer days.
In the EU and in America, too, we see something different under "Federal Day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and days free of work.
Unemployed days are usually ecclesial holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new year are days without work - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
All year long we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The public holidays are the 15th of March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the founding of the state, on May 1st, will be celebrated the work, on November 1st and 2nd, we will remember our dead.
In addition, there are every two holidays on Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shifting" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before that, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked out, the Minister of Labour has been in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers, public employees and civil servants.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on public holidays, are excluded.
Today, the working order is only confused by the holiday at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country will remain formal, as most will take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year, or the special holiday for it.
In the next year there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redundancies in working days than this year.
The calendar is first set up around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a day of rest.
The second re-disposal will be on the 23rd of October: Saturday, 18th of October you will have to finish Friday, 24th of October.
The end of the year, however, will remain unreserved in the sign of the holidays, after everything will lie and stand from December 24, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues at work
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages we never receive - harmless lies that no longer occur to us: they bring "colour" into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether one gets used to these little inconveniences or is better placed to the challenge and tries to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best one regrets it and tries to make it up again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and confessing to being reckless, one would have forgotten to deliver the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can really create unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly anything more nervous than picking up a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - is it gone this morning?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without questions, we should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So don't put any envelopes or post-it out of the office, because it could hit one of your own: none more if you really need it.
Gettratsche on the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means of halting a trade that has already been made in the world.
Who did it to who?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues should not, as far as possible, be tied to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his inner secret, we should not abuse that confidence!
The best thing to do is to keep silent as a grave, instead of directing those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Is there no reason to report a disease?
If you call in the office to report yourself ill under the call for painful headaches, because you feel really unwell, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, inescapable of doing it, fixed-term projects must now be done by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to do it in the office the next day, or that something could come between you and why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with absence.
sum, geeks, phone calls
One is just in the depths of his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud geeks of the ladies?
I don't want to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
Colleagues should not be bothered with summaries, singing, loud conversations (leading across their heads), getramps, prolonged shivering, or nerds.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not in a task (write, plan, organize) deepened.
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed in due time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or messages, one should not seek the fault of one's own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best way to admit his mistakes is to apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up the mistake again, or the failure to make up for it, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sleeping: Comfort for at home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then you should dress so poorly if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress accordingly in the office - if you wish, also nice and elegant!
To make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of all morning traffic.
The radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a true sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the jam differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, as many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the Garagenrock is "in" again with its guitar recital, the local electropop proves: there is new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, music himself in the band Yonderboi before he began to walk his own way - perhaps because a host house does not have two pipes.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, however, only when one had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had started in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" rated its first album from 2002 under the top 50 local albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, was the almost only trend-setter that was marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but none of them were interested in wearing this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album, now released entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", could open new paths to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term is derived from the time when Baláz's Zságer was still on the move with another band.
The airy, flying sound would also be fine, but in addition to the etheric character of music, the louder guitar, the influences of Rock'n'Roll, are due to the zeitgeist and the trends.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the Millenáris premiere.
A song from the album has even made it into a radiobeater - the mr2 Petőfi, who has been broadcasting pop music from early to late, has gradually recorded the listener with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas"), and set the earworm.
So everything's okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: I don't think the term "play music" means much.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also be produced only for the sale that makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The audience's willingness to listen works in accordance with this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that pass around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the unripe changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one thing has occurred to me: If you want to make everybody right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, except that you try to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves as a team player who trusts in the musical presence of the other and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of Mr.2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is the first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style deliberately staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn't have any plans to write a hit that was supposed to hold as a draft horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the soundorgy and the slightly more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six female singers?
Why exactly her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized apeates "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did you plan it for the girls?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs "something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I've sung the melody that same night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on top and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I remember I was pretty electrified at the time, but it already took the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing completely together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood on the stage behind.
Is it intended?
For example, the fact that they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not deliberately want to let them get solo roles.
In the number it is also about forgetting one's ego a little, forgetting who came out and where it is going, we simply allow this particular wing, which raises the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we have felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work none at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes to The Girls", where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes continuously with the concerts and also now that I have "released" the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Irrespective brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Soilless fraudster
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It was almost five billion euros because of it.
It seems, however, that Kervail was only a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, beyond that, certainly was not incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
But as Kervail's statements, which the French media published, for example, the daily Le Monde, indicate, he was a person who achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claimed in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros just at the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February there was already the first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had early payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kervail did not believe this and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had won up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Just when I earned the first half of a billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kervail admits and continues to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has falsified documents so that they don't get to him.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Already during my first conversation in 2005 I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kervail explained to the investigating officers.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"This is like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses allegedly knew about everything, or else they knew.
"As long as I made money, you closed your eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year the big blow came.
One day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make it right.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they come upon him?
Suspected of being on holiday.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look into his cards," said Kerma's finale.
The Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Minister and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes which will enable the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion in the next few years (about SEK 365 billion).
It is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 percent of the funds available to the Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be worth 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is designed to provide entrepreneurs and companies with funding for innovative businesses.
Companies will thus obtain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the current EU fund money acquisition, the Czech Republic is among the new accession countries the least successful so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty years imprisonment for ex-presidents
An appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind grids is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the jailers whether to leave Alemán's punishment at home, or whether to go to jail.
A court observed four years ago that Alemán had regularly shifted government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The year before was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not therefore allow him to refuse him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little-observed, yet very important law in all its silence.
That's paradoxical.
Everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to him.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The government budgets are among three weak points in the past social-democratic governments, which the budget cannot resolve at once for 2008:
The first is the high share of expenditure which is compulsory by law, not only in terms of pensions, but also in terms of social expenditure, which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and partly under control.
A true time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors, in addition to income from taxes, levies and bank loans, have issued additional sources of investment, often unthinkable debt securities, which have made them increasingly indebted to their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks they had received from the State as a result of privatisation.
Now this source is already sealed.
To the extent that we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
for a number of years, like the rest of the world, our economy has been undergoing a phase of growth whose ČSSD boasts without letup.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed even more to the State.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, in view of the global scale, are at least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been completely superfluous in recent years.
Even if it has been possible to delete part of the crazy populist spending adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a shift of retirement age and pension reform next year, practically any policy in this country will end, and, no matter who is in power, nothing will remain to him as a mere administrator.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that there will be officials from ruling politicians who mechanically divide the majority of tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be quite superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years what was going on.
If we do not want it to be a real matter for politicians to become purely administrative officials, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees, to want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these make it possible to gradually enforce a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Cope With Crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
For example, more than 100 billion dollars are going to enter the currency markets via auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it easier for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that the central banks of each state agree on such a coordinated approach to defence or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is supposed to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can grant," wrote Bernard Baumohl, a report for his customers from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do this," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if banks have difficult access to loans themselves, loans for their customers will also be more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided after they failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate, which is used to lend money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other money, and that although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the warming up of the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries most.
President Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism was now addressed at the final UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he stated that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which represents a strange mixture of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a firecracker that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet cartoons of my views."
So now interested people could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatetologist, but he felt he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he was academic, able to understand and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main statement of the book, he stated that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are thus normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore pose no threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are superfluous, inadequate and unacceptable.
In addition, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considered it unacceptable to impose other unproved views on him as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environment, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
600,000 drivers failed to change their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for the exchange in order for the authorities to manage to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will travel on the streets without valid driving rights.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive anymore have not exchanged their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of certificates, the offices of the capital are being oversold with requests, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration manufactures around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licence.
The exhibition will take 20 days for a new driver's license.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must add 500 crowns.
Motorists who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license threaten money from January onwards.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also use it with a warning when violating the law.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, the one from the church can also receive a punishment that does not go on at all.
He could, it was said, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called upon the offices to exercise mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns penalty.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not a personal card that everyone, and one valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are invalid.
However, motorists must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licenses from the years 1994 to 2000 have three more years for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having made a common cause with the gangs of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years imprisonment.
This was decided by the Supreme Court of Prague in a judgment in force, which reduced its sentence by two years or so.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this matter, but first he is faced with the initial judgment.
In other trials, however, he had already received sentences of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned for more.
In January, a district court accused 19 people, mainly because of participation in robbery, and the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused objected from the beginning to the charge with the reason that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police communicated information from the sources of the police, including Berdych criminals, covered various robbery attacks, and helped members of the gangs to withdraw from the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the profits.
The charge is about crimes committed by the gangs between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robbery, whose victims often suffered severe injuries, but also for prosecution and illicit possession of weapons.
In house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser remote tube and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gangs have enriched themselves by many millions of crowns due to their robbery.
In addition to almost 20 men in this proceeding, the Courts of Berdych and a number of others recognized legal force as guilty because of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's perimeter have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main negotiations have so far been to Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and who are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children in exchange - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a decommissioning clinic, the attorney of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, asks for 12 million crowns of compensation plus court fees from the hospital in Třebíč.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore totally opposed to the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high a number of times," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"But in order to be able to express an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that had the other side created.
We're going to find out if it has any bearing at all.
However, we are of the opinion that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of places together," stressed Dostál.
The amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for compensation negotiations an opinion that had been prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and symptoms of stress in different strengths and depths.
The men were better off with the stress situation, even if they were faced with accusations, they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, are doing worse with the aftermath of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba combined the content.
On 9 December last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the Decommissioning Clinic in Třebíč.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100,000 crowns as a substitute for expenses incurred by them as a result of the failure of the hospital in Třebíč, the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are compulsorily insured by law.
In case of doubt, they have to use a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low claims, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally of millions.
Polivka came to his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polivka lost the dispute around the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polivka did not take part in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably file a appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," said Polívka's lawyer after the negotiation.
In the words of "Walachisches Reich" everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is dispute for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitic in our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
However, this did not coincide with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom at that time.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
From an initially fun action, a business and entrepreneurial activity crystallized out, and the Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachisches Kingdom".
In 1997 Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka made public in the program "Manege" for his business intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walloon Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who had devoted themselves intensely to him.
The cooperation of the parties which are now divided lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš began to break up the disputes that engulfed in the abduction "King Boleslavs I. until the Sankt-Nimmerleins-Tag".
The lead role then took on the suggestion of Harabiš's Jarmila Šuláková as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an action against Harabiš and his company which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the contest prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
A new king was to come out of this.
Details and an appointment he didn't want to tell.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be like the king's move in the Walachian.
The king should be chosen for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Wind the front parts
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just keep reviewing my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of 207, I had to complain, for example, about the lack of head clearance on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the bodywork of the combi is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quick On
I just go through the interior to avoid too much repetition.
It is a rather successful design, where I object only because of the busy middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may complain about short seats or head restraints.
On the other hand, the situation has improved considerably compared to 206.
With regard to space, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork here.
In the combi, the previously mentioned lack of head freedom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo bay.
I must call it very well loadable and space-saving (also because of the foldable rear window).
The hollow rooms are equipped with straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and hold even heavier items.
But let's talk about the charge volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains clearly recognizable by 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when a stroller is invited.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat cargo space after folding the rear seats or the very low load edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test vehicle was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, it's supposed to be a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatback.
He's quiet, he's low in consumption, and he's going well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems like his exhaust clogs with a flap, then I can only be excited by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the height of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test vehicle proposes once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper release, electric window elevators behind and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but you'll figure out the additional equipment of a Fabia and you'll arrive at a very similar amount.
So only the decision remains, which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
At British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, causing local fears about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where conflicts between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Arbitration, harassment and delinquency among students have focused on relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused objected that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls were said to have made racist remarks to the man and tossed him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pears and then blew his seat," a mother of Slovak students from The Times newspaper described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even referred to the conflict with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks have been reported coming here for job search.
Some 30,000 Slovak students thus attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this will be fulfilled if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with cellars offering pizza, ice cream and captivating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to a large extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was its bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was liked to be seen and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high houses grew, over the wide boulevards drove cars, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars from the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails for you as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties travel around Havana until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long fallen apart in the salty and moist air.
Mag Havana, in particular its oldest part, have been heavily submerged, nowhere can you find in the vicinity as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleared out, such as Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a Marotte, which is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow-track runs to the sugar factories.
Your fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cleaning and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers are there for some time in the museum.
Excursions
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
It is no longer necessary to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Just keep mentioning that there is a museum in the already mentioned estate Hemingways, whose visit should not escape the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, accumulate fertile soil in their caves, through which weathered rock areas of dense vegetation are covered.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factory.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city was founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied itself in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fiftieth years of the last century that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "talk of sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which is lively after the darkness, and where the music does not fade until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in eastern Cuba is one of the most beautiful in the island.
This view is certainly influenced by the way to it.
Both streets, which lead from Guantánamo, must overcome high and crooked mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba took UNESCO into its world heritage directory thanks to its pristine nature.
The best chocolate is produced there, in the church you will see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several Table Mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess themselves, about all that could be written many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should design a concrete plan for the next few years, following the words of Minister of Defence Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan was not based on their ideas, and the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this in Scottish Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States called the NATO units for more activity by its Minister of Defense Robert Gates, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in strengthening development aid.
"In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start developing the economy and security themselves," says British Minister of Defence Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years according to the American army.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, even sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have deployed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organisation and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they call on other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, expressed himself.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan to countries and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters agency at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months there has also been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticized for being passive.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are located in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fight demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
This week the British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan non-starred: The Germans make games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing the table tennis.
The German imagery went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will speed up to one trillion in 2009
A government debt of 84000 crowns is payable in each Czech Republic.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion wives this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The Czech Republic's government debt rose to 842.7 billion by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on public debt from the beginning of October.
A debt of 84000 crowns is paid in every Czech Republic.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"Up to now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, says: "To exceed a trillion, we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it were to be shown that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take up to 2010.
But I'm not going out of such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The government debt is caused by the government's debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by taxes, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
Domestic government debt has increased to 719.4 billion this year.
The government's external debt now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion at the end of September and since June has dropped by 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The overall debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter over the year, which is really much in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that growth is mainly recorded in the debt securities, where growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before pension reform comes," said Pikora.
Better Than Expected
The funding strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to absorb 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is mainly due to the government deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
In addition, the maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency is 13.3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and the European Investment Bank's borrowing rates of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
After her lawyer was reported, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum and then sentenced to expulsion.
The Briton was accused of allowing six to seven years of students to give the name of Mahomet to a Teddy bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be fed up.
After parents of students complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter starts in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reported headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Muhammad as their favourite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she had never done anything to draw close to a religious faith, I only regret that she has asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is that it is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many of the teachers, who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Remember that the first name of Muhammad is also the second most commonly given name in Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a form of honor to the prophets (which is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you, for example, give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The members of the Troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by Albanian speakers to 90% could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko filed their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika had received a new commission from the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their commission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing the negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a one-way solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo’s administration of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under the supervision of the EU to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council should not choose to do so in their favour.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past , which has led to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
In his view, Serbian President Boris Tradic always sought a compromise and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is especially a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 90s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made solely and exclusively in the Security Council, where their Russian allies have a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: at the Security Council.
Mr Sejdiu replied to the journalists that the Kosovo parliament would have the last word on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanian-speaking population would run out in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush brings an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which met on Tuesday under its leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians have to destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel has to stop its colonization work, Bush explained, reminding the two parties of their commitment to the Roadmap for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities, under Abbas, aim at a peace agreement that should resolve all open issues without exception, and including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that are primarily the causes of conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the course of the 1948 conflict in today's State of Israel.
According to the American president Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide a solution for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor on his part, he committed himself to conducting the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to making efforts to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, a Palestinian and a neighbouring Israeli, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received insurance in this sense from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries in the way that Israel offers peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including Ostjerusalem.
Annapolis represents a cleavage in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab Prince in his interview with the Arabic daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), a police car headed for Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on Rue Louise-Michel.
He had no use, but was on strip, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a police spokesperson.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, thus not released for public transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without a helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after ignoring its progress from the right, a policeman continued to declare.
Alcohol control carried out in the passenger car is very negative.
The condition of the car (encapsulated wing, split windshield, torn-off shock rod) testifies to the toughness of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Girry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation on the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons at risk", in agreement with the main Public Security Board of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that it excluded the investigation of the IGPN at this stage from the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely, that this small-power wheel has arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, some kind of rivet, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained in each other until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles were confiscated and will be subject to technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were buried yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, as a result of which the police had quickly left the scene of the accident, and this, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN is very careful, it would exclude all serious errors as well.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of investigations for which further investigations are necessary and in which one has to be very careful.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these moments shortly after the accident.
He had a direct view of the scene from one of his windows.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed cop who limped.
Two more tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth telephoned .
Given the tension that quickly developed around the incident and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of young people, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I am not going to let the police claim that the young people had not been helped.
These young people have been given first aid.
The fire brigade came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, stressing the prosecutor.
In Pakistan the tension rises
On Monday, the Pakistani police struck down the first demonstrations, two days before General Musharraf had been declared in distress.
According to evidence, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tears gas grenades that employed the officers there.
Then they threw stones at the police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested temporarily.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorneys called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionals, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations had taken place in Multan (Middle) and Peshawar (North East).
On Monday the lawyers' movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the need to do so, and to those who took an oath from Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
He had to take a position in a direct election on 6 October in the following days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was discharged and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, declared the Magistrate of The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the upper command of the army and to become a civilian president no longer applies since the call for emergency, stated the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
It was expected that he would submit his military uniform by November 15th, the date on which his first term as President ends.
The Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denounced the persistent rumors in the country, according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of drug users aged between 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births today were carefully planned.
For one of five pairs even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector who is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A daring exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmoniy module from the spacecraft Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that is soon to be taken up by the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply her with power.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17,5 tonnes heavy module for power generation via solar panels already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After it had been replaced, the crew made it into the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, with a voltage of 76 metres.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can fold up like accordion was damaged by a taped cable on a length of about 1 meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a check-out and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best space walkers.
Large, resilient, very clever, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-hire trained doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After having carefully assessed the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some sort of rail in the damaged place.
He was supported by a second space walker who remained near the lock, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with an insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar panels that produce several hundred volts, had the astronauts invented and built on board the station.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector had fully re-opened before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to enter Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion to counter the A400M residues, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decrease in the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again referring to the residues caused by the slow progress of the A400M engine, which delay the flight of the virgin aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft are between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent group of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to this cost, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, without further detail.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
In memory, the EADS business performance fell from 86% in 2006 due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
Choice of the Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urns: The mass of Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything clear when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied with providing a new attack point against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have disappeared.
She marries an electoral campaign stained by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Zioganov says there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations on the last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration, according to his lawyer continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
After these parliamentary elections, two very important questions arose:
Who will be Putin's successor as President?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is unable to stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the United States of Russia, will the government and President be elected?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovietus, they are not the master of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University even goes back further: In this country, which was christianized for five centuries after Europe, bourgeois society has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again attached to the model of a paternalist state, which was completely adopted by the population, the more, since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians forcibly renounce the personal responsibility they have recently shown after the collapse of the USSR.
Think about it for what long?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the world of business.
And the administrative elite understands to hold the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) are leading the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often tantamount to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Consider what for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to replace them?
A heavy reminder
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, except with a humanitarian intention, that is to say, individually and on behalf of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven States entrusted with their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heckle information
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health status of forced labour, explains Reto Masters, the director of this archive, who are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners of the concentration camps or the warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are working on tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
It is not possible to expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism of the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
The mutual trade between India and Europe currently reaches EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will drive forward the two economic areas enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion and services worth EUR 10 billion each year, declared this week Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission’s Delegation to New Delhi, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England notes the alarm and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned to contain the current recurring concern about the credit terms and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly severe at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it shall notify them in a notice.
The Bank further states that in this way, at 12.15 GMT 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be circulated on 6 December, at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE circulates in an open market operation liquidity for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is prepared to take further steps to obtain the different interest rates of interbank loans from day to day with their basic interest rate.
The interbank rate of interest varied from day to day on Wednesday was 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate has been down to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums circulated by the Bank of England have been linked to fines which the banks had withheld from using.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many suggested signing for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text drawn up in the framework of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, of which 50% was intended for employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After the UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which caused some violent word changes between majority and opposition, some hours before the television contribution by Nicolas Sarkozy about purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of their proposals as an amendment to the legislative project for the correction of the finances that had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is being born
As a result of numerous rumours regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones told C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lullapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 at a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event in which he has ever attended, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work alongside each other in parallel to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Regrettably, we have remained in political debate about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Happyly we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the Lolapalooza Festival in 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago, after it has been profiled together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival in 2002.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax credits in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours are more of a place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts into each other, while at the same time conveying the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuse to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal when no less than the Terminator opposes.
These lock attempts are part of the delegation's tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, appeals to Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those whom one considers to be the best," he says.
The run at the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the top priority of cinema there is at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange leading to a one-year rally? Disunity among the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already breaking hands with regard to the coming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts are not able to draw up any safe forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that only statistically speaking, the month of December is normally associated with positive market developments on the stock market
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock exchange price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant. These investments are mainly affected by the lack of secure equity funds in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the up-to-date trend.
As a result, these experts believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral trend in price fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent to which the US bank's interest rate may fall, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the risk of the increase in inflation.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce a upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a 4 % value since its highest mark on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the Investment Funds and the traditional grant made each year for the pension fund.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could develop somewhat differently this year, especially due to the end-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus immediately after the bridge day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a near technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, whose magnitudes depend on the consequences of the US mortgage crisis.
The analyst trusts that these results are positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of the values to drive the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana of Intermoney matters that this year the great values are in line.
Among value earners, the expert would count the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from the Bank Inversis assures us that the rises in relation to the banking and industrial sectors will be accompanied.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACS has been on a pick-up course and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same course, according to the expert.
As regards the increased consumption behaviour during the Christmas day, in the last half of the year the periodic consumption will determine the market behaviour.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed two declines in the course.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex raised 35 by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
The fact that 2008 will be the fifth successful year in a row (the Ibex has been increasing by 8.36%) and also a year-end rally will be shown.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of his stores.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically important regions of Spain.
For the institute that operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a big milestone.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, since Poplar is the first banking group, the jump is dared to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeated the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to seek agreement, with 75% of all branches being closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday in the afternoon, though not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening hours will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, are able to capture the buying-in customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as they are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will reorganise the premises of those branches already located in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of opening hours is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The relevant bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but involved increased staffing, since a branch did not need more than six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The locations of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocred. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking staff.
The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The broadcaster he had led had increased his value by twice his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4,488,88 million, with Mediaset controlling the principal share of capital (52%), and Vocento participating only at 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value amounts to 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies is rising, in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días), to 2,518.53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies , Vasile says.
Uncertainly, there is still the question of to what extent we can actually act as a stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago his plan to raise this year to the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publicisespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the TV business only increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
In 2006, Alejandro Echevarría's company, led by Alejandro Echevarría, saw the analysts see the main factor for the better market performance of Telecinco.
Vasile, however, assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for official disclosure.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have always indicated much more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the end-mol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is due to the decrease in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
It also reduced the expected earnings of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.

Ibersecuritities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
Two.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buying) measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 as a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.

JPMorgan: recommends reducing expectations in both cases in view of the similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress agrees with the MIDID directive which entered into force on 1 November.
At the same time as the parliamentary drafting, which ended today with the congress decision in the Senate on the proposals for amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members who, in their negotiations and votes, had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regime that guarantees investor safety and regulates individual entrepreneurial activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which re-introduces the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and a promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows both specialised firms and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consultancy companies which associate themselves with the investment and intermediary companies of securities.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding to the regulated circulation markets the multilateral systems of the securities business and the systems for the internationalisation of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to register the focus of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and all projects carried out in order to facilitate their control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission subsequently saw further changes, with the decision that, due to its high level of risk for the investor, the debt securities covered by titles must now be regarded as complex financial resources, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the occupations of diplomats in the economy was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation was adopted which restricted the fields of work reserved for economic scientists.
The Senate, on its part, identified new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator working on external accounts, which do not require authorisation from the CNMV, and its services to commercialise products and to generate customers at the same time offer several investment companies.
The harmonised Consumer Price Index (VPI) has risen by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which by publishing the data seek a local and quality comparison with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by using the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) suggested that the indicator established in advance only served as a benchmark and therefore did not have to comply with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (VPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes , the increase in the VPI was a temporary development in November , while at the same time ensuring that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months .
However , Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good , the inflation differential of Spain to the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
In addition, he stated that there were less surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
The value of Northern Rock has fallen by more than half after the Bank had called for emergency credit in the middle of September of last year, and now it is only EUR 12,000 million (this amounts to EUR 16800 million).
At that time, the Bank’s assets were record 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of trust of customers and, despite the 100% guarantee of the government, will continue to decrease until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin, who would continue the group after the takeover under the Virgin Money brand, has to raise about a quarter of the British banks' income, which will come from the plants in the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their 30 billion target.
The Group of Multimillionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his prominent advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to launch 50,000 million pounds (approx. €70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, where three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder, to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the city of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of Partido Popular and, at that time, chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, after information from Cadena SER, be the original conductor of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales accused the main suspect of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the attorney of the popular , and therefore privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested on leaving his client's residence on the basis of important burdensome documents related to the plot.
To this end, other sources of information from the alleged order payments report Morales to a Galician construction company, which had foreseen the conclusion of a urban contract, in which the construction of a 200 hectares of land was decided.
Eight people are currently under investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and to take the fall of an election victory at Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President-in-Office and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will thus list the PSOE candidates in the forthcoming General Elections in Toledo and, in the event of a Socialist election, take over the office of the Congress President.
So it was announced by José Blanco, Organizational Secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the party headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the forthcoming elections, the politician from Mancha would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had announced last November 15th that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public policy, and use himself instead in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the government president had been constantly pushing for his return to political activity.
He also pointed out that, as in the appointment of Vice-President of the Economy, the party did not want to prevent citizens from taking over the Congress President's post in the event of an election victory and called this an act of transparency .
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a house of respect and not the insult or the shrew to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time you get the impression that the only place where you can't talk calmly and calmly in Madrid is Congress; the president of the government was interrupted in the Senate once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken over the office, as otherwise his political counterparts would call it arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to unmerciful criticism both by climate change skeptics and by those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of it, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of the Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings him to the forefront of the countries that have met the minimum requirements of the Kyoto Protocol in the light of a lack of explanation of their actions or non-action by its government, which has contributed decisively to Spain's being at the forefront of the EU.
Who are the ones responsible for failing to meet the requirements to which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to Spanish citizens the measures it proposes to take against climate change without turning around.
Which companies are affected, which behaviour of citizens is to be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and which economic consequences result.
More specifically, whoever must sacrifice himself and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there will be no such statements in the future.
Just because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be taken against climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero's election strategy appeared to be so dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding edition, decorate the meetings, and inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not indicate that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future, or we can only refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana in Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the mayor's secretary and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody because of the suspected suspicion of urban violations, today it was called out of investigative circles.
The City Council was arrested at its residence, from where it was brought to the municipal office and in its premises until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the urban administration and at the municipal building management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests were linked to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it appeared that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be redesigned. This should be built on the property 4000 apartments after the local administration had given it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation which is prompted and carried out by the First Court of Totonas.
The first six prisoners were brought to the judge today.
According to investigation teams, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales are also identified.
In addition, his ex-wife, the owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend who lives in Murcia, is under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the group Nuaria , the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to have served as a sub-group of Nuaria and received the lubrication money.
Investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban crime, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out 11 further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies that were directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding industry, who should have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was assigned to build the largest residential complex of the locality belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which it was necessary to rebuild. The goal was to implement a construction project which would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.

If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to invent a price-name different name with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is located at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper, on November 18th; incidentally on that day whose issue contained criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy of Jokela's school.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturant who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the president of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, invited the teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the sub-level curriculum for philosophy in high school.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be punishable by six months of imprisonment.
But once again, if you rob a music business of a value of 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, theft will be classified as a criminal offence, yet the penalty will be lower than for a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you split a car and give it back 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music-data exchange.
Taking part in a rebellious conflict, a three to 12 month prison sentence (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) is followed by a six-month withdrawal of freedom from data exchange up to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose author's authorization has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, well, if my colleague should be right, then someone has done a pretty good job of screwing up his demands.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more of them.
So the feelings generated by the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared by means of an tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct with their answer and thus also received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, it also became more brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Minister of State from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been invariably following the crimes of the Balkan Wars for eight years. Her seat is in the prosecution of the criminal court of former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the chief responsibles of the massacre of Srebrenica - with the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - namely the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the loose.
Its names are on the list of directors from Switzerland Marcel Schüpbach as a model for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a Polit-Thriller, follows the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her project to track the missing criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to narrow their networks more closely.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance covering a possible damage caused by the driver includes a high cost, which in turn depends on different factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
To own a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we're dealing with here.
Auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the insurance premium agreed and is obliged, in return for damages, to present the amount of the compensation in question.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which is composed of several factors, including age, gender, the time of issue of the driving licence, family status, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall determine their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and thus also according to the company's conviction, they tend to be less accidents than single persons.
The benefits attached to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and therefore also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
Insurance must take a number of points into account when setting up the premium.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points that should be considered when choosing insurance in order not only to make a performance-oriented choice but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds meet numerous obstacles in choosing cheap insurance, such as low driving practices and young driving licences.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance policy to take out full insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full case with self-share, so that the benefits of full insurance cover but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage itself.
The amount is determined prior to the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain at First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance policy, which assures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
Moreover, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hands to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit card is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company concerned.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in tariffs.
The amount of credits and fines depends on the company and its revenues.
If the company has a successful year behind it, it may allow to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most appropriate to opt for full insurance with self-employment.
Usually young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, the Spanish President of the European company explains, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been removed.
Nevertheless, in the case of a married customer who has no children, it is more advisable to take out full insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the corresponding person.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, full insurance with self-employment (in the case of an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. If you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy should be used only for the third vehicle year.
They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera states.
For pensioners, it is possible to take out full insurance with self-employment (with an amount of EUR 150) or an extended insurance, which will only be used with a sufficiently high credit card.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough choice that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eighth finale in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will be fighting in San Siro next Tuesday for the missing point to achieve their respective goals before the completion of the Champions League pre-conference. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the Scottish will decide on their participation.
The Italian team has already confirmed five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow still needs another one with nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time at the 13th in the semifinals for the final, which will take place at the 16th.
Thus, this group will be completed before all others and the decision-making at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow know that they would have a better starting position in the eighth final in the event of victory.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be able to compete in a defeat of FC Shakhtar in order to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because with nine points equality the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milaners will try to avoid the Scots in the evening. They hope to achieve for the second time in a row the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League, after they were defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a gate of Kaka in the post-play period (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw-off on the hand.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for Rossoneri's victory, the team will have to concentrate on its own game, as both reaching the eighth-final and joining the UEFA will depend on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit Vancouver for the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour.
The Spice Girls set off for their first tour after the release of the band in 2000 in the Canadian Vancouver.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) just before the start of their concert at GM Place de Vancouver, explained that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the sold-out stadium, where a video on the story of the band, which had provided terror at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage, which had previously given them the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who made the GM Palace glow, although his wife’s nerves Victoria had banned him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Schow Victoria Beckham told us that the British Star didn't get our wardrobe to face once, and that's why I'm really excited about what he's going to think about.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the group in 1998, due to internal disagreements two years later, led to the dissolution of the group, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that feelings had changed to the spice girls.
And that's why I thought why not, so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said she was separating the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer was also told that the disputes were resolved and that they were all very happy to be back.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special engine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, reported by the TV station CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nanny girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will appear in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23rd December.
New concerns about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of damaging Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is managed by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is monitored very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
Previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state of gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more because the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said Ukraine's Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters news agency.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] across Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas is one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the largest gas deposits worldwide, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom complements its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the principal financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish state health service did not have any precise ideas regarding the number of his foreign staff.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The principal financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October at Old Bailey and was burdened with the suspected car bomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the public health service will carry out checks prior to the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The principal auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Management Board should adopt guidelines on criminal records that help employers to control in different countries.
"Although we have found references to these controls in some staff documents, these were not routinely carried out."
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines with a high degree prior to the appointment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign healthcare workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of the appointment of potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is probably higher, also because the Boards have problems identifying those employees who are off indefinitely.
The investigation continued to establish that established control procedures were largely complied with by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its pre-employment policies and guidelines for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was a matter for me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on pre-employment controls for all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division Predominates Film Award Ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has hosted five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.

Dame Judi Dench was awarded the best lead actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for putting the British film into the world public.
The prizes were given in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis ascent to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for only 3 million pounds.
Nevertheless, he has brought in two prizes to Dutch photographer Corbijn, so far best known for the cool cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - as Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary.
The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian Mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstonon, who is called to play tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize, which was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my type of man, a great actor of his time, I am truly honored."
The independent film awards, known as biphas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terror plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells was planning to smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong fast Eingreift squad to protect plants following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an in-ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the prisoners were part of a cell led by a "racete expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, 22 of the prisoners tried to kill clerics and security forces.
The government has warned clergy to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the hardliners under the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida militias consider many clerics in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policies of the royal family that dominate the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to aim for the provincial Saudi government - have it in foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy plant.
"This was a very great effort on the part of the security forces over the last five months," a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior told the government television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims who are being branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from an orbital European spaceship show that the planet is even more like an aversion to the Earth than it has been known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, however the Venus of the Sun is somewhat closer.
Billions of years ago, there would have been conditions on Venus, which would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbraked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express spacecraft spacecraft spacecraft probe, which has examined the plant for a year, provide a sobering view of how Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like the Earth, possibly with an habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
With Romeo said he didn't think it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate finally declared himself ready for the presidency to engage in a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters take questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28th, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the Democrats asked about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflect exactly this time the state of the Republican party that breaks down in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with those who chose the upcoming YouTube clips to show.
However, immigration was at the centre of the first half hour of the debate, which has long been devoted to a single topic.
The topic is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to operate a ballot box when they heard things they liked: The TV set noticed peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly about the boundaries.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he has been tireless in terms of illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his house.
The two were particularly opposed as a questioner to ask whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to hack into this topic.
None of the two men have serious opportunities in nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they had been using immigration spaucets earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This theme, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly raised in a problematic way than other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be regarded as torture.
One of the questions asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations at first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see if Jesus would support her, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabees ascent in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donation and his applause storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two were shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party had not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkling to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, it is not particularly slippery.
No title seems to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes to be lulled.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has spent more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) for the British ruling Labour Party over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without which Gordon Brown would have done well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the call for an election, in a demonic way insulting British intelligence by claiming that polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the dreaded Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean has developed.
The unsavory rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought corporate associations against the government.
The tax-exempt loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative fusseries.
A trio of retired generals began an uprising in the Oberhaus from protesting against cuts in military spending: being Minister of the Armed Forces, they claimed, is a part-time job.
Now there are the varied donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and her former Chief Executive) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown breaks in irrevocably direction of departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point where they feel it is impossible to govern.
Neither do people trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not even have to be there for long, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to get lost; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability documents, for example, are related to decisions taken by Brown as a Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's failure - as in the long "money for noble title" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that it was him.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely defrauded.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new spirit of political donation is a good example.
The Garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be the case, but the decision on this did not stand up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financier, who was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping after a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to make the measure full, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "learning lessons" are not very complicated.
When the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Besides there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, how to find something permanent for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, which has been idle for six months, and progress with a radical reform of political party funding.
This would require the Labour's hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through indefensible integrity and solid competence.
Card Shark
Is the credit crisis America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that the back fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is in violation, predators have the country's credit card market in view.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion when the risk of contamination of unfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both out-of-book and column rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or are too late for more than 30 days.
The HSBC announced last month that it has collected 1.4 billion dollars of fees from its American consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card recipients.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and filaments are still low.
According to Moody's credit rating agency, the third quarter total of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
In part, the deterioration in the rates can be explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a large part of the credit card losses; the number of registrations (and thus summary fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports on sound payment rates that show how much of its debt pays off consumers each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that spending volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debt, now that home loans dry out.
However, card exhibitors look at the cash flow instead of capital, therefore falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall when the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt is becoming more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and revalue the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British benches confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to trial for their role in the fraudulent system with the former principal financier of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their application to justice on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had pleaded innocently for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before US district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty for a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during delivery procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, its case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 pointed out to Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation relating to the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to pluck out a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron championships that helped to tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it really had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow wrongly dismissed Enron as paying 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others charged about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed in two charges for conspiracies for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is sentenced to six years in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is a three-year sentence and one month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, broke down in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer make billions of debt veiled or dwindling businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling will end a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracies, fraud and other charges have been null and void since he died last year of heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth on the last Friday at the Millionaires Exhibition, a four-day orgy of show-up consumption, which was held in a shattered exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly arrived Russians in everything, from mahogany-capped yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orange Porsche into the vision at the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas at its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were regarded as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear to be the world's most free-to-use publishers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
This week in Moscow, and elsewhere, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, totaling 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 133,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
For the first time she had visited the fair together with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they march through the halls in evening clothing on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, name themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking for the cars and I'm trying to decide between the infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to target the new empires, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand for several hours in a jam to visit a pungent warehouse that unswervingly placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knife, Mövenpick Eiskrem, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically sitting at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a rembrandt image made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper climbers."
In fact, dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brand with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a commercial show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, missionaries of millionaires or simply tourists pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil said that he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the big orange Porsche for $10,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, said a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, that he would have sold three autocooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are identical to the chain arm tires, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette.
The cost: 22,000 dollars for a four-station.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise of the local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British example, which were filled with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said that his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
Passersby stopped to throw the piles of money around, mobile phone photos, while they leaned back in the middle of the reserve wealth, get caught by friends, or just to plug in a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Missed operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest Thanksgiving as Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod kept two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the boxer of the medical body viewer arrive," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
They heard that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a mourning through the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was widely known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," said Mr. McCarthy about Ms. Arroyo in a telephon interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer who works for the alcohol control commission, leaving two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the prosecutor of Union County Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgical treatment.
"That's one of the options," said Ms. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to tell me if Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether a part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a twisted rose smoke stands in the narrow front yard and calls a Dalmatian behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find his way into the provincial and hard political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets through further interest rate cuts, strengthened by alarming comments from the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, president of the central bank, said that politics had to react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continuing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm dismal markets, in view of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped to calm Wall Street down, in view of further bad news from the US economy, now that US real estate sales reached a new record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global employees, in a cost-reduction measure to offset heavy losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these offices will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289,40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressures on markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank, granted to the European commercial banks, had been granted a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to supply additional capital to the money markets in London increased when the three-month "Libor" loan rates for the UK banks increased by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, calls at least under this special title, is here to help the chief coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan decide to do so, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electorate, if not even for those in part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth fight position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgements are necessary that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked if John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good conclusions that know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a major influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time, if he can take a wicket and a bat has to get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better than James Anderson in the last season, for example, who apparently will be playing in the first test, even when Stephen Harrison declares himself healthy and how the wind swings into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a point of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough into an important testkricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, will follow their conservative instincts and instincts for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's network meeting at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay speaks 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his stroke, which was still obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex enjoys life.
He is not impressed by anything on a Kricketplatz and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he recently had a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and to call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from afar, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he swings his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, the right time to choose another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be there well, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visas expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, before arriving 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy from a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni physician.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad, and how it was safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to reverse at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the United States, helped drive Al-Qaeda out of her bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Slikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Slikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the U.S. increase and the growth of local "groups affected", which armed and defend their districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and abstinence in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to give no more visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-saar state yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this slogan self-imposed the smallest federal state at its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland educational system, which is placed at fifth place in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
From tradition, the universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
But also the country children bring the Saarland in an above average number to the universities - many of them without graduation at the high school.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, educational expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the Federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also considerably expanded.
According to the population, the second best in Germany is the provision of dual degree programmes.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education of Saarland has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we started a number of reforms in the general schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that has now also been copied by other states.
If pupils' performance improves sustainably, future comparative studies will only be shown.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students declined from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Saarland did not increase as strongly as other Länder.
Bayern's better off.
And to the drudgery of the Saarland, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise one could point out in this area.
For the language of the neighbours is obligatory in Gymnasia - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez reverses the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks will tick differently soon than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez has the timepiece in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela announced, a new law states that clocks will be adjusted to world times less than four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone which there is no other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The Left Nationalist said that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he will not have relations with either the Head of State or the Colombian Government.
"I cannot do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the Alleland have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
The result of the dispute was the decision Uribes to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia, where it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spucked his face" in Venezuela with his decision, criticizing Chávez on Sunday.
Chávez is also widely spoken in Spain.
A new phone ringtone provides terror in the country: "Por qé no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who, at the recent Iberoamerican summit, was delighted by the constant call of the left-wing populist, who had run over his mouth.
Germans threatens 2007 wage reduction
Despite the strong economic cycle, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees could really expect 2007 with less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price of food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New burdens could also apply to workers in unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent for the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Employment Agency is not to be embarrassed to have to ask for loans or grants, the SPD politician has been quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the increase in prices of food and petroleum products has driven inflation to the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices rose by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
In spite of its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more like what has been thought of so far: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind vortex of Poland, as they occur on earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of around 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russel reports from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has created life on earth: thunderstorms should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly any living thing on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it's a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the 1990s no more probes were on the way to research this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results now presented in several "nature" articles underline not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighbor planet and Earth are bigger than initially assumed," says Esa.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strangle at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the Earth's winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, is circling around the sun in almost 225 days.
But he turns himself around much slower: A Venus Day takes 243 days on earth.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar is hardly reminiscent of the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under quite similar conditions.
Both of them gathered water that remained on earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler takes care of Germany's reputation and asked the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world in this question," Köhler said to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Anyone knows that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but took Merkel in protection from the accusation, they run a new China policy.
"The German Chancellor has not taken a break from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had expressed indirect dismay at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by a number of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the chancellor's office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only unloaded the German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to the SPIEGEL information.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China denied it when European politicians in official function received the religious leaders of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other current provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France
Roadfighting with the police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France.
Everything had to be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from being discharged into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister for the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot with shotguns at the police: After the heavy youth gangs in France, Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar development in Germany.
"We need to make sure that we do not also build up and discharge social explosives in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said, the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, countries and municipalities have already worked with emphasis on reducing problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Islamic Conference, the first success has already been achieved."
However, it is too early for de-warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy road kills with the police during the past nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings also burned.
Greater integration efforts by the Federal Government were called upon by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the French Krawalle, Kolat warned against "neighboring effects".
The situation in Germany was not as fragile as it was in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people under 25 years of age was "overaveragely high".
More training places must be provided, above all.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in families".
Moreover, many young people with migration backgrounds did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
It was necessary to give young people "a quick opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were in use, a helicopter flew the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash bins and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of around 1000 security forces has provided peace.
The police will go through as long as necessary, Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, some 80 policemen were injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the follow-up night, unrest took over Toulouse.
The Krawalls set fire to a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutors, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The firmer's remote appearance shows that the coalition is in the end - and that there is nothing to be expected of itself.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After their inconsolable appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was strenuous and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that should finally be ruled by it.
The allegation that she focused too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an extremely high rate.
That is provincial, she said, and first showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented to everyone how much their accusations are.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling of feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a disfellowshiped politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in trouble there himself.
For example, climate protection: because it praises itself unstoppably for the decisions of Heiligendamm, it does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
Above all, the self-loath - so much modesty the CDU boss had failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flakes that the upswing comes to the people.
She thus damages her image as a pragmatist, solving the problems instead of speaking nicely to the world.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a fringe appearance.
Child poverty and the concerns of the lowly ones?
She's got a few extras left.
It is significant how often it promises to be when it comes to childbirth.
Three approaches need Merkel there to get a half straight set out.
It stumbles like on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard fight - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The suspense of the candidates is already eroded on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney suggests to his contravent Rudy Giuliani.
On the other hand, this counters with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," Giuliani replied, suggesting to the former Governor of Massachusetts that he employs private immigrants without paperwork.
The candidates are blowing up the attack: Since the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30-second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his contrahendant Ron Paul, who alone in the round calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also receives strong reading from the Vietnam veterans of the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method that simulates drownings as torture.
However, the fact that the major issues of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates shows the reactions of the local audience in St. Petersburg in Florida.
When conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium welcomes them.
Once again it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, "and in front of the base and the television audience, he pleaded that he still belonged to the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the sling when, in his opinion, he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf First Rules in Civil
One day after his resignation as head of army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf has been defended as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday he had handed over his post as head of army to his associate Ashfaq Kiyani and thereby bowed to international pressure especially from the USA.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unbloody military coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf will, according to General Attorney Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus meet another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which had occupied Musharraf after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had weighted lawyers with him, had rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern region of northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four more were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventies again plays: The three band members of Harmonia took up their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the Revival, an average of their great time appears "Live 1974".
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The appropriate sensation then takes place in the form of three set men at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of them, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius crowns in a flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, gets focused on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
And sometimes it adds accidentally to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band Harmonia is playing again, has provided some excitement under Krautrock lovers.
Where one may reveal here: Targeted demands revealed that the name was so persistent, even though the collective pop memory was so persistent, to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should not the Germans too celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially in England and America, what is called misleading herbrock was always more important than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life's Work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, it was seen in questioning German pop faces.
When Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the surprise did not know any limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later jumped at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overcrowded with harmony because the trio existed only two years and at that time also developed a much lower effect than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First, one played under the Berliner Schaubühne in the basement.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label maintained by the Church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then acted as a guitarist at Neu!, the then perhaps most radical German group.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as a fugitive city.
Less ideological than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
It's more like a crazy artist.
It is said that in the Sperrmüll there was also a Wimpel of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing club and a name for art.
Some held Harmonia from it.
The first album was "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so calm and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
The rice collection did not serve alone the self-finding.
The CD "Live 1974" now released was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record scene of almost 50 people, as someone thinks he is missing.
By Rother then came the desire to force and occasionally practise Harmony.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful ever since it was Harmonia.
The Grimessemer Livealbum is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an original German contribution to living music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Berlin Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, during the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the Briton, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Love Parade inventor Dr. Motte.
What would be the full range of the influences of the Krautrock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legend formation serves projections of other black and white photos of our wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No more by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drums to unlock the instruments via self-made effects devices unheard of tones.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the Technically Intensified Tuftler.
The choir of the house doesn't change anything about that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, the sound clouds are husted and whispered and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (forcework) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia can't get away with it even now.
Even the most obvious is thoroughly considered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can give you great happiness from the nerves or fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
Two films of "The Hunting Party" and "Murderary Peace" are again concerned with the Balkan war.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and baller or they are too touching.
Richard Gere is also unable to help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice-interesting roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove one's desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes a hunt" (Why must film title today always be as long and will be like locator tariff agreements?) perhaps?
He provides a wonderful eye-catching portrayal: basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been done if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long been behind him, but who, as a ruinous monument to his decline, has still retained considerable remains of the once charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production of "Murder peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films continue.
With "Murder peace" one can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbin from Kosovar hedgemen, on which one quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that not even the Serbs are represented here as the sole root of all evils, the far-sea flat film loses too quickly in baller and action.
There remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be investigated in an exemplary way, why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are emerging to detect the Serbian war criminal "the fox" could have become a new "apocalypse Now" with another director and screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are a bit fretful: Both times small teams go to the woods to do something the military can't do, and both times it's going to be a trip to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the downtrodden cynic with the heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has yet another romantic affair with a Muslim boss who was later murdered.
"The Hunting Party" then goes down the stream when the reporters succeed in the time-lapse process within the last five minutes, what Nato, CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have failed in five years: catching the war criminals and leaving the Muslim Bosnians to justice.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the cinema.
The film has a profound human concern.
He wants to suggest that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (there they should exceptionally agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensely because of secret political agreements.
But the good idea and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
It says about the wood mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I sympathize with the swollen bulldozers, indicating: how strenuous it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those swelling heads, but they suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War Film.
Recently, in this paper, it has been reported that all of Iraq's films were Hollywood's big flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always, if a star wanders around the world's crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jeneits all Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blut Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close for a while.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood was able to film a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" that are now considered classic have not been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home on two screens in real time, even just too much about the world's conflicts.
And this robs the screenwriters of the carelessness they need to tell good stories.
After all, "being or nothing" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastic distanced artist's view of the Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked in parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "That's just because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel way and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Beust reaps criticism for Olympia Absage
The demise of the mayor of Hamburg's application for Summer Olympics has led to strong criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But Beust urges realism in assessing the chances.
The Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared on Wednesday a waiver as "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivational forces in the city as the Olympiaidee.
"Without this objective, the sport policy momentum would not be able to maintain to the same degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained unrealistic on Wednesday with previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions would be unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation on an application from Munich for the 2018 Winter Games expected for the beginning of December.
"This preference means, for us, that we will not have a realistic chance in the period we have thought of until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreaming for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beusts' statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years, Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to build a chance by already burying the plans at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
An absence of the application is also contrary to the opinion of the Head of Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General German Association of Higher Education.
There by Beust called Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Hochschulsportverband had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfaktion asked the Senate not to use valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map of Olympia and blocked the construction of the apartment," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Kleinen Grassbrook always demanded integrated planning for Olympia and later use of housing, the CDU had set the "event factor" on one side.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had given rise to a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg failed in Leipzig, however.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Who connects the terms Sweden and wooden chests is thinking of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently in Sweden fabricated wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the well-listed Brillo boxes from "Typ Stockholm" listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago has aroused doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of the year 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now coming to a sobering conclusion: the six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has made to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and most of the approximately one hundred more Brillo boxes of "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is shattered, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's approval, produced hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: These were not from Warhol for cost reasons, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not works of art, but their role models, just exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol probably granted permission to produce a few Brillo wood caskets in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Zeitzeugen now speaks of about fifteen crates, which at that time have rightly been included in the art and auction history as authorised original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes called "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than 100 000 dollars at auctions.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited around a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had then left him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 crates were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three Swedish private holdings in addition to the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press strips were first ground and shredded, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the colour was applied directly to the press panel without any foundation, not to oil, but to acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced to investigate the "serious allegations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, there has been unspeakable silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had lost their lives in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
The hotel had previously been bombarded by government officials using tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly set up with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, apparently crossed over to him and joined in his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government troops blocked the district around the distinguished hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously ordered the elite of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Her government has been overestimated by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was the main scene of attempted mutiny by about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours at the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
20.05 percent of the capital is now held.

In addition, companies have entered into talks on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile telecommunications products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United-Internet speaker.
The two companies set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
First, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of more than ten percent of Freenet and not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to further increase all options, in particular their participation in Freenet AG.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
The persistent and hard to see poker around Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The United Internet and Drillisch holding held 6,01 percent of the freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will add another four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of Vatas investment company had already been agreed in August.
