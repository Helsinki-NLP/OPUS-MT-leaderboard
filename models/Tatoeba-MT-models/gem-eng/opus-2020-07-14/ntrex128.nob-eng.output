Welsh Members do not want to appear as «muppets»
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today under the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
As a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament, the proposal will be adopted.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative from Labour explained his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means "dustede", and pwp means "bäsj".
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ‘unsatisfied’ and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the conservative party said that his group was ‘open’ for the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British word for ‘dust’.
In this context, Welsh letter W is spoken in a similar way to the letter U in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: ‘Of course, the members themselves have the last right of destination as to the name with which they are to be referred.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing general support for the rebuff of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members) was supported by the Commission, but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
It seems that the representatives suggest other options, but to get all the parties to reach an agreement can lead to the head office of President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a draft legislation for the change of name in the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the national Parliament, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
The representatives have the latest voting rights on what to call them when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the polling towers to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on the name of their country to be changed to ‘North Macedonia Republic’.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the Northern Neighbour constitutes a requirement in its territory and has on several occasions opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the change of names, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The support players of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in name is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stills – the crickets of Harlem wear
"The old ones I spoke to have told me that before in the time there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘Now there are none of the parts.’
He said the bar's departure was understandable.
"People associate socially with each other in other ways", he says.
«Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which all visit regularly.»
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. ‘And sooner or later, they are back at the beginning.’
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining resorts.
“Most of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only accelerate the day when these churches have to close the doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Union moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main handlers – because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioner had planned for the reconstruction they bought a carillon.
Prest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was «the church bells of the poor people».
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘a cultural tax’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are hired by the church's legion and others by the bishopship.
The Church Council — the administration of the congregation, composed of laymen — wrote to the bishops in July about its concern that the bishops would “try to force the costs” on the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or the contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of openness on the part of the bishops.
Hai hurts thirteen-year-old lobster dolls in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he appeared after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to drag the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel he thought at first that the boy cried out of the excitement of having caught a lobster, but he realized afterward that the boy shouted 'I was bitten!'
I was bitten!'
His whole collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, who discovered the damage as he reached up to the boy.
'I cried out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'', added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is distributed in critical condition.
The type of shark that performed the attack is not known.
Navy captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had serious injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to commit itself to the beauty market of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's challenge is Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with department store-like makeup and beauty shelves, manned by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong intake in the 2.8 million beauty markets of the United Kingdom, which are constantly experiencing growth while the sales figures for clothing and home items fall. If the experiment proves successful, the concept will be expanded to several shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the attempts by the supermarket to find a new use of the site previously used for TVs, microwaves and home items.
Sainsbury's has said that they will double the number of beauty products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also have better space in noted brand areas, just as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because this is becoming increasingly demand-driven among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop has to test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's shops. One opened in Croydon in south London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Networking and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the sales are going to look more and more like a commodity magazine, as the supermarket takes up the fight against cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods away from food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after purchasing both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The last attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty care departments and pharmacies failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was phased out following a dispute over the distribution of income from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sale of its 281 store pottery to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy, GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury decorators, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury, said: "We have transformed the look and design of the beauty shelves to create more inviting surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are so prepared to provide advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty competitor representing a new experience of action.’
Peter Jones is ‘racial’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is programme manager in This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on their own new gold-plated contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “racial” at an admirable meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. This was where the gold girl of the television admitted that her new agreements – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time left to their clothes and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she is going to leave Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom on the way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was definitely Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next decades.
Everyone is absolutely shocked that she has chosen to withdraw.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that is now ready for sale.»
Experts believe that the This Morning Programme Manager, who is among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company several million pounds due to large investments in products such as cushions and lights,mood and food clothes, and a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-children's mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman of the board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% ownership interest in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S brand ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin which will host the ITV I'm A Celebrity.
A source standing near Jones said yesterday 'We will not comment on his business affairs'.
Checkmates "and then we fell in love"
He knew of the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider a little presidenty, and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
‘I have not given away anything at all.’
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a great mess on the road to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a ‘correspondent response’ from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States has, instead, continued to have sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a gathering of his voters.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as putting a stop to rocketsters, helping to get the hostages released and to get the lives sent home by American officials.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
‘It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this stepped arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,’ said Trump and pointed in the area straight ahead.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia are raging an island and killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, non-resident NPISHs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of more than 10 % of the residents of Lombox, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be sent in.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging," Sumbung explained.
Save the children now assembles a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Emergency Management Office, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Taking into account Indonesia's earthquakes, the country is terribly poorly prepared to deal with nature's anger.
Lying for protection against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning system on Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death rates.
Even in the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made upgrading Indonesia's fall-back infrastructure a major feature of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and on the railways.
But lack of money has been a major problem for Joko's administration, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from sustained sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have moved to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1000 people were killed and more tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs were destroyed in the streets with machetes, arrows and bow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in battle against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the Premier League defeat against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes in the fight at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it towards the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box, with the ball falling toward the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante come and hit the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it further.’
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a passport with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the midway and pushed into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic brought a quick handover in the middle lane.
He then fired off a great breakthrough fit that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left foot kicking past Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group game of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death tolls from the tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
Death rates following the earthquakes of Indonesia and tsunami have increased to 832, notified the country’s crisis management budget early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings collapsing after the earthquake with a strike of 7,5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, explained the agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A homicide investigation has begun after the corpse of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 at Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of killing.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contacting them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I want to ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi driver, who may have caught something on their car camera, to make contact – they may have information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated when he told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats “it’s so terrible” over and over again.
At 14 there were two police cars behind the lockdown, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the lockdown and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to ‘log 247’ as of 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial that has been dragged into the debate on 'Rewrite History'.
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures that were carried out by his fanatical puritanic followers.
But the Comwell Society of History described Jeremy Crick’s publishing house as ‘malicious’ and ‘an attempt to rewrite history’.
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing production of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800's opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many still think deserve to be hailed.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is becoming by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, seen as Parliament's defender against outside pressure – in his time it was of course talking about the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.»
Killing Pigs Killing Chinese Peanuts
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in south-west China, according to local news reports.
The man, only mentioned by the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered with blood from a cracked artery near a begge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to place vaccines on pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the town of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had apparently travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig's path was open.
He said that inside the pig pen, there was a big mistake in blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
"Being to my cousin was bloody and malted" explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed Yuan went into the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else.
The Yuan's family and the market's management are clearly negotiating compensation for the death.
Even if there's a ssource, it's not the first time it's been registered that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a Massachusetts farm and caused serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to ordinary, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
‘They only play.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You must only show adequate respect.»
The remains of the Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the south-west of the United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler seas on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be passing through north-Mexico and south-west America during the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity northward towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the interaction between tropical moisture and the thread approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the south-west in the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular south areas of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can lead to a wide range of rushing rivers, and thunders will lead to local gusts that can contain dust and sand.
The thread approaching will result in local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along southern California.
Total rainfalls above 1.3 cm are possible, which can lead to liquid rust and rapid, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations all over the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics keep very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout the Central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of Central and East America are likely to start hot in October, with degrees high in the 20th century from Southern Plains to parts of north-east America.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate reporting indicates that East America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, divided into six TV networks, saw Thursday's gripping witness from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that must have taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's great surprise in the last second, when it appeared that the senator for Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaughh felt her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In a passionate witness Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average number of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC ratings.
Number of seats was not immediately available to other networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give you a little perspective, this number is the same as the final game of the American football championship or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led by the networks, with an average audience of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued to be high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican office made a statement that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the lift to a court hearing while protesters screamed at him.
He stood with lowered glances for several minutes while he was scorched out, while the event was sent directly on the CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling our country the truth?"
He was told, "You have the power when so many women are powerless."
Flake pointed out that his office had come up with an opinion, and said as the elevator doors closed down that he would have more to say about the matter at committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearing directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued throughout the Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to the Counts and then several other senators.
Flakes' choice had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of ‘political game’ around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, the British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to play ‘political games’ with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the national interests.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs was ‘in total ridiculous’.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police attack Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the LSU player's death
The police have attacked a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and targeted for deliberate killing, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the Basque.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admits to having shot and killed Wayde.
His deposit is set at USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The forensics officer of East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a bullet wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana Stat Police for their work group on the collection of refugees, the federal police laboratory, the Southern University police force and the local population for contributing to the investigation that led to an attack.
LSU’s sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for his ‘hard work and search for justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball trainer Will Wade said the team was "cracked" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
The volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash spraying out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico's public crisis prevention office, warned Mexico's population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity went into the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within one day.
Ethate monitored several cases of roaring and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash that covered windscreens on the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico city.
Geophysicians have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital after a 7.1-shrinking Central Mexico earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters of independence had a clash with the police, while several thousand attended competing demonstration stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot police, and bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later in the day, when the police used batons to limit the fighting.
For several hours, independent demonstrators stood and shouted ‘Never forget, never forgive’, face to face with Unionist demonstrators shouting ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during protests, according to the local press.
The tension remains high in the exorbitant region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming number of redundancies, but it was poor attendance because the vote was boycotted by most of those who opposed the liberation.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote that was held at polling stations across the region.
Release teams went on the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist prosthesis with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope of being independent of Catalonia.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy about getting voice, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive win in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems with holding up pressure this year, as many of their well-known leaders have gone into self-inflicted exile or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
‘The situation is getting more and more tense’, he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison pending a court case since last year, announced that he will be at the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the oppression and the regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired against the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the win
Reverended Livinston amazed Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's other losses after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to the Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won away in the Premier League this season and is playing against the leaders of Hearts, which is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home fight against Rapid Wien in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained uninjured through six battles in the division.
Livingston misses opportunities against its sleepy guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but the bomb on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send forward the kick after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The host was playing Rangers in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for their guests at the ball of death.
And that's how the decisive goal came into being.
Rangers gave off a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga clear track, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
At this stage the Rangers had had the ball mostly all the time, but the home team defense had proved to be impervious and goal-watched Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-coring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a short-fitting.
Crossings continued to enter the Livingston Box and were still rescued, while two criminal claims – once after Halkett’s protest against the yields of Glenn Middleton, and once by hand – were overlooked.
«Fenonomic» from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all of them, and they continue to surpass all expectations on the way up.
The game style and the crew have hardly changed since they got to the top again, but Holt will have much of the credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a tremendously well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toe raise throughout the fight.
Rangers, on the other hand, had not my inspiration to sign up with.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they have not been able to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs – they only got into the home team's lane half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There has been a division of issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police indicated security as the reason why a population of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the followers met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — were also heard away, criticizing both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Collision: Cyclist killed in a car collision
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a London passenger car.
The collision took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in the Deptford south-east of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the hospital was treated by ambulance staff, but the man died on site.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a driveway where the driver escaped from the scene on Childrens Street, about one mile from Saturday’s collision.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working on identifying the man and notifying the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus roundabouts are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and still ongoing.
Specialised Tornado officers have been picked up to handle the incident, involving eight prisoners and limited to one flight.
The officers were treated for minor facial injury on site.
One prison spokesperson said: ‘Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and beats.”
HMP Long Lartin lives more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, riot police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked by billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It is the source of Arizona taken by a tropical low pressure, but just that will probably happen early next week, as the remaining force of the Hurricane Rosa moves through the desert regions in the south and carries flood hazards.
National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain weather will start late Monday night.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has pointed out on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or larynx within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border of Arizona.»
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5-10 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolia Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the south-west, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains mountain range and Great Basin, are likely to have between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those who are outside of flood risk, Rosa may be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the south-west US is currently in a drought.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, there is slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane hits Rosa land on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind force of 137 km, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific, losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday evening or afternoon.
Precipitation of parts of Mexico can be severe and lead to high flood risk.
‘Total rainfall of 7,5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to north-west Sonora, with opportunities for up to 25 cm of rainfall’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the frontier of Arizona dawning on Tuesday morning as a tropical limp, which this is moving further through Arizona and into southern Utah within the late Tuesday evening.
‘The main danger expected by Rosa or its residues is very severe rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the south-west desert of the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening floods and liquid debris and rapidly in the desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attacks for Killing Trials
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are under attack, suspected of attempted killing, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition shall be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who may have a mobile recording of the event to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has "suffered under the smallness and mind" of the democratic party
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the democratic party’, said Trump in front of a crowd meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered under the smallness and mind" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and strongly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford is also testifying about his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw where brilliant, capable and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most successful lawyers of our time, with a spotless record in public service,’ he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred a discrepancy to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to vote in the middle elections.
«We are five weeks away from one of our most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
‘That’s why I’m travelling around fighting for the best candidates.’
Trump claimed that the democrats aim at ‘resisting and preventing’.
The Senate's first interim vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves that plunged against the shores when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six-metre-high waves plunged into land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and dragged many out into drowning deaths.
The tsunami came into the heels of an earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
‘When the tsunami was born yesterday, people still had activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s Office for Crisis Management (BNBP) at a Jakarta press conference.
‘Tsunami was not alone — it took cars, three tribes and houses, it hit everything on land,’ Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.»
Some 16,700 persons were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photography published by the crisis management seat showed many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After-squats continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The Earthquake bill could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Authority (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power of Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the etate.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘overall’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death tolls and damage could be major country coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely fraught with no information’ from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” said Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
«This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse.»
On Saturday, the level was strongly criticised for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had taken before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared by social media, one hears a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
In the course of a few minutes a wall of water comes rushing towards the beach, and demolishes buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power breach that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated have still desperately needed food and other necessities.
The city airport is only open for auxiliary work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll after the tsunami in Indonesia is rising above 800.
It's awful.
World Vision's staff from Donggala have come safely to the Palu center, where they have sought shelter under the tarmac in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses," he said.
It's awful.
In the context of the aid organisations, they began their bold preparations for providing emergency aid, some complained that foreign relief workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, foreign money, supplies and workers cannot be discharged into a crisis area until declared a national disaster area.
It has not yet happened.
‘There is still a provincial disaster’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Greit, this is a national disaster' we can open the borders of international aid, but the situation has not yet been statused."
As the sun descends over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami hopes friends and family of those who are still missing that their loved ones should be among the miracles that brighten up the gloomy news scene after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was liberated from rescue teams after spending two days trapped under ruins with the corpse of her mother next door.
Gendon Subando, the trainer of the national paragliding battle, had trained two of the missing paraglidings of the Asialeks, which was carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional ought to wear," he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who attended the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to gray pick marks, rather than a few blue pick marks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal USD 26 750 during mini-banking in Newport on the Life
Friday morning thieves stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini-bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a mini-bank in the entertainment complex and got ready to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who ‘run up behind the Brink’s employees’ and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
The police have not specified how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation was formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she cancelled on 'emotional basis', according to the serial creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
'I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you''," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's acceding president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he should never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he ‘never will use the military to suppress the Mexican people’.
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing political student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, the investor and the exerciser of artificial intelligence, who has the job of Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have come with notices regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough," said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chances of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence coming from the United States,” Lee said this week in an interview with the CNBC.
Lee, whose book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Sinomation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that struck the U.S.'s best Othello player, and later was a manager of Microsoft Research or Director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the US government's former technology competitions, as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation of wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government appropriations, according to Lee.
"It is not China that steals the academic leaders, it is the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have an artificial intelligence degree should be offered a residence permit automatically," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at establishing a national safety commission for artificial intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to the ‘North Macedonia Republic’ in order to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement on Greek territory and has vetoed them to include them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50%, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot box is, ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that arose after Yugoslavia’s fall, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
‘I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,’ said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be essential because a large enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The change of names requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said they had not received any irregular reports by 13.00.
However, the attendance was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
‘I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe’, said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and the son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
‘We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we will be reported with raised head, not being let in the back way’, says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.»
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to a desperate investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
'I think most of them will be too, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO', Zaev says after voting.
He says that a 'yes' answer will be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another study, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of those who answered are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero maneuvers past the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack player received a fit at the start of the sequence.
He ran around the race with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right shoes to hit Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right-hand side of the web.
“Aguero still has some foot problems,” said the City Manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
‘We talked about that he was going to play 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough fit along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was across the deadline.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strongly.
The always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who lead over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-to-2 saying over National Friday night, but is still looking to secure their first division title.
Even though we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be what most likely becomes the highest level of combat I get to play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in it?"
The Nationals have still not advertised their starting pitcher for Sunday, but should certainly be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-hand Washington player has this season won 18 matches and lost 7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 knitouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump’s People’s Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred discrepancy to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the middle elections.
'Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant, and that's why I'm traveling around fighting for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued «You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they must overrun to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
The democrats, he said, aim to ‘resist and prevent’.
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "not bad and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate court committee and mentioned the democratic senator, Diane Feinstein, by name, upon which the audience listened.
‘Do you remember her answer?
Did you play the document?
Um, um, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am, after all, the last in a large number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I had to be censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Concerning the importance of having responsible economic policies, concerning national security, concerning Europe – ironically enough similar issues to those of Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On Friday’s draft for the Nottingham East Labour meeting, it said that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been just this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of 'softer, more friendly' policies is too long forgotten, if ever it began.
It becomes increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party and all opinions are judged on the basis of their acceptability to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, either with the security of the nation or with the internal market of the European Union.
When I speak publicly – and it has nothing to say about what I say – I receive a variety of nasty messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns center policy and tells me that I should not be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sexually discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to be chafe.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross excrement has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is, we're no longer such a party that's open to everyone, and every motion of censure and every change in electoral rules is narrowing the lot.
I have received many advice over the past two years in which I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will 'make everything better'.
But that's not why I was involved in the policy.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom at the public school I went on to be literally ready to fall, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councilman and government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country rages our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and understand the desire to waste time and strength on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it's to those I represent, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think best serving their interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbesied Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only unoccupied of the ten.
Finally, there was just as much of their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they had that led to the home team losing the win, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our struggles so far and still uninjured, so I must be satisfied with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better at using the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's attempt for 14 minutes, with the target park from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the management, but a yellow card to the Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, let Melrose level the position, and Jason Baggot performed a trial without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty park before he, just before the break, scored and the goal park a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose began the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with the target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
These became a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on shore, and from the reboot Ayr management increased even more than a trial from Stafford McDowell, with the target park from Climo.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the track to the fullest with a trial from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team nevertheless came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have tacked Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown when throwing in behind the advancing Ayr-maw.
Climo performed a goal park, as he did again almost completely from the reboot, after Kyle Rowe obtained David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flanks Gregor Henry abducted for the fifth attempts of the home team.
Still Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the serving industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as director of a restaurant company with a fee.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, which he writes for and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The pigeon has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kluhren now plans life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Aktriebmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that Kühr wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s ‘living restaurant business’.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers patrol a rigged marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: «We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
The whole inland state of Bolivia has continued to remember the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s, and the country extends after once again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in decades, with Bolivia awaiting a verdict from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
«Bolivia has a driving force, community spirit and serenity and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive attitude» said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the Grand Court ceremony in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its cognition in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate its own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put a lot of emphasis on Monday’s recognition.
"We are very near a return to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, which held in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean land and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the International Court of Justice's award came only six months after the last arguments were heard.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration’ said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the ruling of the Court was unusually swift.
According to him, Monday will provide Bolivia with ‘an exceptional opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile’ and the possibility of ‘stopping 139 years of disagreement for the benefit of both parties’.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – which is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – has used the maritime situation as a political shell.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific’, he added.
‘Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He encouraged the United States to comply with promises they made during a meeting of the leaders of the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to launch the blocked atomic diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wanted dream" that continued sanctions and American resistance to that statement that will ever end the Korea War will force North Korea to kneel.
The American authorities are sceptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first undertaking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to give up on an arsenal country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the last within huge headgear, which is heading towards a dress shop near you
If you want to have any big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne stripped a selection of strange, oversized headgear as part of his SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motels at the motel in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent down their eye-catwalking creations.
Valentino's most eye-catching garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a spring-like wide brim that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-primed watermelons, a trollman hat or even a pineapple, but they are not made to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also removed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had restored lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation reminded of diving equipment, including snorkels and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream in the biscuits.
And if you're looking for even more big fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be headed towards a dress shop near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of the ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brim that has been seen on all and everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the bathing suit model that wears on it.
The orange effiavesken, which is edged with raffia fringes and completed with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the motel in Paris.
“I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the dress shops next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact, it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The fresh schools of Scotland are still demonstrating academic excellence, and this has been maintained in 2018 with a further one year of excellent exam results, supported by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other societal activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free Schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after electoral field in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when the words his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words of his heart shall come to pass."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest pass rates from fresh soles.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the A exam.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the FVO showed that 72 percent of students received the A exam character in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also got A.
This illustrates that in Scotland, freshschools support foreign languages as a decisive skill for children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a professional choice is now valued at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the boarding school for fresh schools and other places.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons given by employers, there were difficulties in filling a vacancy, 17 per cent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in order to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will give real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Communicating directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language that could speak a two-digit number of participants (15 percent).
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered to be the most valuable for the United Kingdom on the way to 2020, for example mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a choice of language to choose from in fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be considered as ‘international communication capability’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

LeBron shall have its Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over to fans who want to watch LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening session against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not settled.
‘It will be more than one and less than 48’, said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
"I don't need leadership games at this stage of my career," he replied.
Time of Trump’s public meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a series of electoral meetings in the evening of Wheeling, West Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned public meetings in the next week, including stopping places in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the voters go to the polling stations in November.
When is the Trump West Virginia People's Meeting tonight, and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will start at 7:00 PM on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the week's hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault.
With the main objective of all these people's meetings, it is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that during the next few weeks these five people’s meetings aim to ‘enhance volunteers and support players, while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are moving towards a busy campaign season," Reuters heard from a campaign spokesman for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening’s public meeting, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract support players from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh press’, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is following the polls.
‘It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to raise his opinion,” said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a fully-indicated sport concept, yet something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now there are four, so we'll carry it with us as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead by four points and there are 12 to play again.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have got some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and lead by example.
The deep celebrations became higher as his round continued, and sank into a decisive puttingting to raise the match to the draw when he and Thomas lay down two below after two.
His putting, which won them the match of 15, was met with a similar scream — by the sort that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is beyond chance.
"We really just have to put all the clothes on and focus on our own game," said Spieth.
That's all of these players now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players to score more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who undoubtedly are Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual but glorious couple have four out of four and don't put a foot wrong.
«Moliwood» was the only couple to escape a booky Saturday afternoon, and also excluded Bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to float both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's greatest competitors, and there are no other players' audience either to secure a European victory as the sun descends over the Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Everyone prefers both at the same time, in each one's hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hammered easily with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs-helt, when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two double in the course of the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish lay so far behind that they did not have nubbesjans to take back the lead.
But on Sunday there is no help getting.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can reverse in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the Team USA has missed some of them, especially in the United States.
Europe is leading 10–6 at the beginning of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong advantage at the start of Ryder Cups last day, after completing Sunday's four-balls and foursomes games with 10–6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led an with two victories towards a broken Tiger Woods, and raised his score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, who fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't get back any of the lead.
Jim Fury's page has to score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together got the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the only couple to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in football, they co-operated seamlessly to beat down Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more repressible 5/4.
Woods, who limped through two games on Saturday, flashed to the inside, but has now lost 19 of their 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2/4-1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this warm day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who has won Major's three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-hit 2/4-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a layer ready to collect after a four-point lead at the start of the single game, but as current holders, only Fury's side needs to reach a draw to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn't seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will "in no way" join in unilateral disarmament without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continued to strengthen distrust of the United States, and that the country will by no means agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out ‘significant goodwill measures’ during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to disperse nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘However, we have not seen a corresponding response from the United States’ he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.’
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting of a President-in-Office of the United States of America with a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the 'nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula', while Trump guaranteed the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and increases pressure through penalties to achieve its goal by coercion and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’” according to Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can force us to kneel is a wishful dream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.’
Ri did not mention the plans for another match between Kim and Trump as the American leader underlined before the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months, adding: ‘If the other party to this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as locked as it is.’
However, the tone of the Ris speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland America with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after «Mr. On the President» Trump called Kim a «rakettmann» on a suicide mission.
After threatening to ‘completely destroy’ by North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work still remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclearly degraded.
On Wednesday Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, and said ‘It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months’.
China and Russia consider that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions undertaken.
But US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the lines of the UN General Assembly, and then he said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year, but the last trip was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had progressed, but only hours after the charges of North Korea accused him of having made “walking demands”.
North Korea committed itself in a meeting with Moon this month to set down a missile area as well as a nuclear weapon plant if the United States of America took ‘similar measures’.
He said Kim had said that these ‘corresponding measures’ he wanted, were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help the students to get more sleep by tackling the growing uncultivatedness of chewing through the night with coffee drinks as fuel.
An academic found out that students at the world's best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
‘After the talk, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why is there no one who has said this before?’
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to the Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to the students how important it is with good sleep habits in order to perform academically and sportingally, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. of the University's health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are told how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes the participants think about their own daily routine.
‘We are aware that this is not going to change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to chew all night, he said, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on the students led to a growing lack of sleep.
Enough and good sleep should be the student's 'secret weapon' against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in hunger mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, and he took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the whole campus.
Next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master's students to take a similar study program before they roll into the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on an alarm for when to lay down as well as for when to stand up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light may interfere with the daily rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goals of Menga beat out Gerrard's men
Rangers probably suffered a loss when Dolly Menga's goal hit Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first win since February says 4–1 on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 matches as manager and since then left his eight points from Ladbrokes' Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga beat to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to cancel out.
Rangers now fall down in the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
There may be more trouble in the yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown away from the public.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on the team, which sweeped past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who scored a point from Heart's last week, and he would have been happy for how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers might have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first suit sent Scott Pittman through at Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player played the odds.
A long free park by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target bar.
Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game leaned more in hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have a penalty park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers managed only two shots on target in the first round, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis's opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game's time, no one can deny that they deserved it for the pursuit.
Once again, Rangers could not handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the pause, and the player shift gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the players away to play exactly the kind of fight they like, when Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the management in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Lithgow headet from the corner.
Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton had probably a late claim on the penalty park as he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and was also a part of the popular culture through the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals emits.’
Evans, "Let's make sound now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave name to, lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can now ‘see’ a protein common in many cancers, and are then re-injected in the patient
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, found that the ovaries she suffered had disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typically too many cancers, and then reinjecting these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: "The results indicate that we have a highly promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘ drives growth of different cancers’, including breast cancer, ovary, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, whereby immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells, has been effective in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with violent defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was built in studio on Saturday Night Live after a famous performance in which he praised the US President Donald Trump and said he would make the election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he stretched out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, ‘How do you like Trump, he's racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star fooled Brett Kavanaugh's explanation of the Senate Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford presented.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording by West was uploaded into social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by putting out the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard about the choice of headgear in the back room.
‘They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: 'Do you want me to understand what the reality is?' he said, and said he should 'put on the Supermann cap, because then nobody can tell me what to do.
Try to love."
His comments were arched at least twice, and the employees who worked at the SNL looked embarrassed, reported Variety, where a staff member said, "The whole studio was dead quiet."
West was brought in as the last little-replace for singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: ‘To one of our bravest: TAKE TO STOP THE MASSENE’.
But talkshowvert Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just «the one he is and it is absolutely amazing».
‘But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) that I mean cultivate and spice out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was “besenet formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapperkolla Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, there is late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington extended towards "vigil masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the swordswing Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of machoelt and says such roles in movies often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculineity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married the Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very busy with the theme.
"It worries me a lot at the moment – where did the masculineity go wrong?" he said.
‘How have we raised men in view of the problems we are now seeing?’
Kit believes that TV can have part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculineity" because of the strong masculine roles.
He continued: "What is innate and what is nourished?
What's on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel like they have to grow this particular side of being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions in our time – how can we change that?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not do any forerunner or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is ‘complete with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play the leading role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a rambler.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so that's how something good got out of it – my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrette, in which Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been hit in the country," says the health representative.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases are transferred via sex, which marked a change from earlier.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through transmission of blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now nearer zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in the Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men having sex with men, eventually marrying women.
Much of the disease infection is due to insufficient protection in sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a response to the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the involvement of leaked data on republican senators, the noses of ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiration theories’
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected charges on Saturday that members of her staff had published the personal data of three republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Democrat of Los Angeles, insured by the claims, was made by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and Web pages.
‘Lugner, liar and more repugnant lies’, said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information included alleged home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the web Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
‘This unfounded accusation is totally false and a regular lie’, Waters continued.
‘The members of my staff - who have been compromised with their identities, personal data and security as a result of these unfair and false accusations - had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a regular lie.’»
Waters' opinion was quickly criticised online, among others by the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
'This denial is aggressive', Fleischer wrote.
‘This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
Don't put them in defense.
You must not doubt the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act in a calm and understanding way.’»
Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters to the critics of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing too aggressively during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the intercoms, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great – if that’s true”, he tweeted.
In her opinion, Waters said that her office had notified ‘relevant authorities and the police of these false charges’.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed’, she continued ‘and that they are held responsible for all actions that are destructive and dangerous for each of my staff’.
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloody Rowan Atkinson in spy parodi
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit references in all new films with a British slant and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parodifranchis Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was reborn in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-sathe about how manifestly hopeless we are becoming the nation’s new export product?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his roaring eyes and his rubber face has been renewed his license to root it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking kinopausum.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a damn Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes one single note to the musical feature of the fire wagon theme during the opening ceremony at the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson played in the farthest forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's a great moment in the latest Johnny English course.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades slit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to justice, but the humor feels quite blood-poor and strangely superfluous, especially now that the 'serious' brands that 007 and Mission Impossible willing away have comedy features.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than adults, and to me, Johnny English' facades are not as inventive and pointed at as the silent film loops in Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web networks of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the corruption of the guarded agent – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
That's the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and downturned figure that's already going through a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort of Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
The intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she must pick up some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence.
English is caught back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, tormented helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, split with a submarine commander, a hysterical high-class lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and the Robin-style of messing up everything else on behalf of the Queen is back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko fantastic femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the cyber problems of the United Kingdom: the ludicrous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with far-fetched sidewalks: disguised as waitressers put the guys at a brilliant French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy it is so much that reminds of the kids television with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour acknowledges that they plan to let the British work four days a week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day working week – but get paid for five.
The lot will obviously make use of artificially intelligent revolution savings for business managers by giving workers an extra day of the week off.
This will result in a three-day holiday for employees, at the same time as they receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to turn the pendulum into the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said, ‘A four-day week is not the party’s policy, and is not something that is considered by the party’.
Labour financier, John McDonnell, last week used the Labour Conference to elaborate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of 'unseemly directors' and 'profits' from public service providers.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting back the entire share item because a Labour government can deduct from perceived unfairness.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the board of directors and set up staff funds to transfer 10 % of the equity to private sector companies to the employees, which could receive an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI review of Kavanaugh might change their mind
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question as to whether the Agency's findings may cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy made it more open than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
‘I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He was firm, sluggish, unambiguous».
But Graham's voice seems to have been stoned.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it had to be an eye-catching finding," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetically," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will change that."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped to combat poverty?
This Saturday is New York's host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will make thousands of people flock to the great lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
In order to receive free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to carry out a number of tasks, or ‘actions’ such as voluntary work, sending email to a world leader, taking a telephone or other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when there are now only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of making people fight for change, or just another case of so-called ‘clickivism’ - that people feel they contribute greatly by signing a signing campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million ‘actions’ from the trailer, with a variety of objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group could refer to 390 exposures and notices resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to ‘help children exploit their full potential’, and promised to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history’, said Ambassador for Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the usual questions on the website, ‘what makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?’
Global citizen replied: ‘There will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-a party movements before us, we will succeed because we stand closer together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at this year's event in New York, who will be led by Deborra-Lee Furnesss and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the marine as ‘blocked’ to prevent Russian energy exports — the Minister for the Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ resort to the marine in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, the US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — particularly when operating following an invitation from the legal government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
‘I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy exactly as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern edge of Europe’, he should have said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means of dealing with this.
‘The United States has the option of ensuring that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocking to ensure that the energy does not reach the market’ he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event that was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit that profile itself as ‘the voice of energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are very much the same.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel’, he said, referring to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The opinions came after the Trump Administration has been on a tour to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
Employees in the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European gas pipeline 2, which according to Trump made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the North European gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s glowing resistance to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
‘I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier’, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply’, said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" on his presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" whether she would act as a presidential candidate after the intercoms.
At a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be silent.
"It's time for women to get to Washington to fix the shackled government, and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether I am going to act as a presidential candidate’.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the polling and said he ‘went the country in the wrong direction’.
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI check before voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should remain silent in 2020.
58 % of ‘probable’ Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be silent, according to a poll of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The bet said he wanted to make an official decision by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palins PTSD during Trump's elective meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after having worked in Sept.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers," she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of the son and other veterans of war: "They come home a little changed, they come home hard, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldier comrades and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and aimed for violence in his home on a woman, choreing with a report on home violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police.
18 Länder and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. provided a briefing from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the prosecution in Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner ‘and his violent union sons’ abused her, but authorities in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations with pervasive problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the appeal court for immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants who had fled from domestic violence the right to apply for asylum.
State Attorney Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy ‘regards many decades of federal, federal and international law’.
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such prohibition is contrary to that principle’, said the Amicus curiae briefing.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policy of refusing access to immigrants damages the American economy and says that it is highly probable that they will be entrepreneurs and "contribute with the necessary labour".
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims as refugees from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view’, said Sessions in the Notice of 11 June on Policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all problems – even all serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – the death tolls double in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became ever worse.
"It was very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling her feverish son at an evacuation centre in the crowded town of Palu.
«All the time, you see ambulances that pick up the dead.
Clean water is defective».
One could see residents who came to the ruined home and easily through damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had the strength of 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of the injured, among others Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside the Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershock.
He gets tears in his eyes as he retells how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves in safety.
I was pinched by the wall that rushed together, I think,” said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife yelling for help, and then it was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of ‘trafficking’ by ‘propaganda ads’
One week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that painted the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the annex China Daily paid to move into Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's allegation that Beijing tried to influence the US election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said US officials according to Reuters.
It is true that foreign authorities use advertisements to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new customs duties on each other's imports.
China’s criminal tariffs early in the trade war were to affect export companies in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican party, reporting Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who is a major sportsman of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading stage in the Sunday's Des Moines Register: "His stairs now rise up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
‘By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities take advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad into the Des Moines Register’, Branstad wrote.
‘As a contrast – at the abiscius on the street here in Beijing you won’t find many dissenting opinions and may not experience real reflections among common Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are below the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party’, he wrote.
He added: "One of China's largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not inform which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before the Kavanaugh facade, warn analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several allegations of sexual assault aimed at him, analysts warn that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI review in the last second would be enough to reassure angry voters.
‘Women will not forget yesterday’s events — they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November’, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang «November is coming!» while they demonstrated the passages of the Senate when the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
‘Democrat enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode’, said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, on the news side.
'People say it's already been tall, that's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger ones choose between 18 and 29 years, which often do not vote even if they disagree with the President.’
Even before Ford’s public testimony that gave a detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believed that it would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced the appointment.
‘This has become a happy root for the Republican party’, said Michael Steele, former President of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It is not only about the committee’s vote or final approval or whether Kavanaugh is inserted – it is also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have dealt with it’, Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, pointed out a group promoting the election of democratic candidates to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who they should believe in in the cool water of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of those asked were entirely or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were totally or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38 % said that they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his diploma, while only 30 % said the same about Ford.
After the Flake play, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh was in a drunken state attacking her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitalia to her while they were at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a launch to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lees' open source platform Solid.
At Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the purpose is ‘world domination’.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
‘It is a historic moment’.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own 'personal online data stores' or a POD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about the personal repository online is that it's completely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal data authorisation’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.

Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria Cross receiver from World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel and President Bernard Vann were awarded the Honorary Ceremony on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military distinction.
A memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said there was a ‘fine symbolism’ in that the stone was to be uncovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's award winning bust.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann battalion headed his over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later he rushed towards the shot line and led the line ‘with a large head’ forward before storming a field cannon self-sufficiently and struck out three of the sections.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were "what I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Corps Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he ‘felt very honoured to play a role in the parade’ and added: ‘The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people’.
MMA trailers were up all night watching the Battle Sports Program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you have stayed awake all night to see the densely packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you will not see the main battle.
The participant from San Jose went through 13 matches, including six on the main board and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers of the United Kingdom were sitting humming when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to see the game.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as "a kind of sick joke".
‘It is state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 p.m., so they have to transfer to children’s programmes’, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the shipment.
'Peppa pig, yes!'.
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work with the mission plan to include the viewers in Britain in the future.
'I think we can figure it out for the sake of the rematch,' said Coker.
«But it is 6 a.m. on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe with-- when we put over, there were many messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly variety.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But that wasn't it, it was a government thing.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to reach far for the trailers, but tipped over.
There is an unfortunate situation’.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a lesser sense of worth to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before in high school he realized that he wasn't like others.
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the homofile's rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the OL.
The usual program leader for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, should be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared as a little lost on Lavere's first shipment and said he felt 'less worth' than everyone he grew up with because 'it was not socially acceptable to both boys and girls'.
He said, "To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have the power and strength to succeed."
He would prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the OL and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in this year's Samveldelekker in Australia to appeal for several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others 'hope'.
The three times the world champion said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - « surprised me».
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, until a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything concerned that I had only to win a gold medal," he said.
‘You know what, there are bigger things than the gold medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 OL and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I had dreamed about all my life – to jump in front of a home audience under the OL, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - which meant a lot to him in his drive-up before the Olympics and which still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs goes on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Moldwake Mickelson taken out for the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th. Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if there's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench of team captain Jim Fury before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of the events, as he had so often been for the United States, it five times the major-winner shares the day between being a cheerleader and working with his game at the rank in hopes of fixing up what's scouring.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area is still punishing the wild.
And if the track itself is not scary enough, meet Mickelson, in the ninth fight on Sunday, the British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game can turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Fear expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a clapping on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
‘He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers earlier, and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldos record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached its individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven ties, but Fury said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
‘He’s funny, sarcastic, witty and likes to run the geese with others. He’s a great guy to have in the locker room,’ he explained.
‘I think the younger players had fun trying to get to him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game».
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant management at the entrance of the last day's single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but carted the win with the least possible margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
‘You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjørn, photographed after seeing the class of 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus lies.
I have always said that I am focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bear is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and add: "I couldn't do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow it's the individual performances that are at the center, and there's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the full.
It's the message that you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, player Jim Fury will try to get his players to deliver better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Fury himself has been on both sides of the major revolutions last day. He was on the winner team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out the ‘Miracle at Medinah’.
I remember every damned word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the team in 1999, had fought with his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle battles.
We'll arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel about.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top-ranking match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player sequence.
"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it's standing all the way," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship delayed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold days of the war, but this will not happen until the earliest next year due to failures of systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the mastership of the brand new frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, who quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have survived the marine in 2014, but the major problems after delivery were pursued by the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered completely back in 2007 will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
They are agreed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to apply the most recent frigates for up to two years away from the port of origin.
Still delays, however, mean that the advanced warships – they were said to strengthen Germany at sea – will already be out of date before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125-girl made headlines last year, when German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important ‘software and hardware defects’ that rendered the warship useless in a battle mission.
Software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are going to be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the crew of older lads in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits its ability to perform upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including training of the crew – has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached staggering EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany's marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Government’s Defence Committee, confirmed that the marine is actually ‘empty for usable ships’.
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were outboarded, but no new vessel came.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the marine.
National Trust Thieves on the Secret Life of Flag Museums
New research carried out at a landing point in the Scottish Highlands shall reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to design future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brownish and water-flagging mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special callers will be located at major locations around the property to track bat activity through the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound analyses of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bat calls and the species doing what.
A habitat map and a report will then be drawn up to provide a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the installation of pastures and the best management of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has sunk considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and works affecting breeding sites and habitat reduction.
Windmills and lighting may also present a risk, same as fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials and attacks from hake tax.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes for catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and roadside obstacles when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten qualified experts who regularly carry out surveys, screening of breeding sites and, among other things, rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at the Three Landersendom in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
‘We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the importance of mapping the bats before carrying out maintenance on a property since the accidental destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps exterminate an entire local population.
Flag mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we just don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against himself as ‘false news’ and says that people ‘want fame’ by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying her 375 000 dollars afterwards for keeping close to the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million follow a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as ‘false news’.
'No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says five times winner of the Gold Ball into the camera.
‘They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by stating my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added the footballer with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called ‘an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the football player will claim compensation for ‘demnifications to an extent equivalent to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years’.
The alleged event must have taken place in June 2009 on a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have gone back to the footballer's room where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 % a good man" who was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries at the hospital were taken pictures, but later they filed an agreement outside the court because she was «lived for revenge» and was also concerned about «being publicly suspended».
34-year-old says she's now trying to settle down because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “will mourn forever” about losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will mourn forever” if they lose the status of world leader in automotive production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing in case of a possible Brexit without agreement can mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant — producing Toyotas Auris and Avensis — produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
‘If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see in my view that production at our factory stops’, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that they will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what the car manufacturers say is supply chain risks for any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “order as needed” and parts are arrived every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars made on-demand.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may stay at the border, which is said by industry may lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day's inventories at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production will cease.
Clark said that Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further relations with the EU is ‘presist designed to avoid such border controls’.
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that makes us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
‘The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue absolutely what has been a very successful set of supply chains’.
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: «My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back».
A government spokesperson said: ‘We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union’.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again," says The White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Vice-Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be «exposed one more week» while the fight around the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump assistants and Russia, as well as the possible obstacle to judicial exercise by the President.
The question whether Trump will dismiss the Minister of Justice or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has for many months grumbled under the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of addressing Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which at the time was in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he 'would rather let go' to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judicial Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI check in one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which was further subject to a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On questions about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's postponement because of everything that happens with the highest court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will contest that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Program host Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to reluctance to the ‘self-goodness’ of TV reporters, although she added, ‘I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-good’.
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
‘The President makes more questions than any former presidents’, she said and added without providing evidence: ‘We have looked at the figures’.
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but ‘If the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We try to get it to often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the past weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences during visits by important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week the president showed the possible reason, when he did a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens who work in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: ‘Debate negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on extradition have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I will therefore repeat now how much I value the effort of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and outside, provide valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely their home and we sincerely hope you will stay here».
Christion Abercrombie undergoes rapid surgery after head injury
The defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went through an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee State's main trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
“He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there,” said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him back for further examination.
A functional from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘no information on the type/volume of damage is available yet’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student, is inside his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five tackles Saturday before he finished the game, which gives a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The increase in the document fee will be charged from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young people to choose with the promise to offer more affordable housing and hit high-income groups.
The increase in the price of documents will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The surplus – which is added to the current document fee, including the higher rate imposed two years ago on the second house and the purchase of housing for rental – can be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom.
Many prosperous areas of the country — especially in the capital city — have become ‘ ghost cities’ because of the many foreign buyers who mostly live outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals to reduce the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded Theresa May to reject quotas on reasonable dwellings to resolve the UK's 'bad housing policy'.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an eye-catching array of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unfounded drafts.
He also wants to give the municipal councils greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said that I would spend my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our degraded housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes that are too hard-working British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless remains».
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old shots rejoice over the challenge of reviving the North East Club, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
‘I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
«But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that withdraws me.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeeded in the club».
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to succeed such established names in the large club, and has previously rejected the approaches of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Success to me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League’.
From the structure and facilities of this club they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has been in management for only three years, after a period of assisting chief of Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in Heart's coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa to get back from downpour to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of downpour to win the champion's title next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
«It was likely a proper roadway divide», he is remembered when he took over the management of Alloa.
‘I really thought management was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created a reasonable income from it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it in terms of stress and pressure in the job, but management feels absolutely right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable I have known throughout my adult life.”

Perfect time for a pint is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing survey
The heat wave of summer has strengthened the revenue of the hard pressed pubs of the United Kingdom, but leaves more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2,7 % increase in turnover in July — while revenues for restaurants fell 4,8 %, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant, CGA, as a summary of the figures, said: "Consequently, sunshine and England's unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when the pubs went up 2.8 %, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1,8 % fall in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than the restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service were also difficult with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as with the Rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted out to drink.
For chain-based pubs and only increased turnover by 6,6 % that month, with food serving decreased by 3 %».
Paul Newman, analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sporting and social events are still the main factors in foreign market turnover.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to have difficulty, and a 4.8% annual-on-year turnover will be particularly painful at the top of ongoing cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving farms, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a prolonged breathing room».
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in roll-outs of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industrial sales controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of GBP 9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One of five children – some are only 11 years old – have secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, showing survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed pages of fake Insta.
The news has increased the concern that sexual content is shared.
20 % of the students said they have a core account that they show their parents.
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – creates accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in fake Insta accounts — a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has increased the concern that sexual content is shared.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent ‘main account’ that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to ‘violate me’.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Director's Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is terrifying that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the free moralists in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Management Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated librarian, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who are leading sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide recreational environment, and we are sure that the law-enforcers in Scotland will enjoy getting her into the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm anxious to act as a voice for law-enforcement practitioners, and I hope I have a lot to do to guide sport in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 meters below the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympic gold.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The games said that only the time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
There has been hard work, but I am quite good again and have learned to walk again, and today I do exercises of flexibility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!’
Breast pump ads comparing mothers with cows split opinion online
A breast - pumping company has split the opinion online with an advertisement comparing breast - feeding mothers with dairy cows.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world’s first silent chest pump worn close to the body’, Elvie, the technology-based consumer product company, published a fresh and flourishing music video inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of loud and lean into a song with, among other things, the following text: ‘Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see any tail’ and ‘In case you didn't understand it, this isn't the jur, it's my puppies’.
The choir continues: ‘Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls’.
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has got mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it paints the beauty of the "grossiness" in the meier ribs.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth,” one wrote.
Elvie breast pump takes fine place in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: ‘Appreciably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?’
Another addendum: ‘For a failed ad’.
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she thought the song was ‘unbelievable fun’.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would like to have one if I still breast-feed.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another comment: ‘This is a funny ad aimed at mothers as pumps (often at work or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that celebrates or condemns the daisy».
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discrepancy pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women are pumping themselves, they say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is perfectly quiet, has no wires or hoses and gets fine space in an breast-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to light up breast pumping and all the challenges, while in an entertaining and recognizable way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mom showed up on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of migrant children arrested has continued even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children with support players.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of being in the country by pronouncing and demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of immigration and customs authorities, witnessed to Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for support for lone minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested did not have previous criminal scrolls.
‘Nearly 80 % of the people who are either support players or members of the household for support players are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people," says Albence.
The officers try to handle the children more quickly and introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be produced via videoconferencing instead of attending in person to conduct their case on residence permits for an immigration judge.
Those considered to be unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to reception workers and reports that have occurred in the past few months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who are struggling are easily overlooked due to the size of the plant.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without getting enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can reinforce traumas that many people are already struggling with.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish ‘accuracy powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now within its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said that the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the cover of combating terrorism and ‘will be treated thereafter’.
‘They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally’, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘war on terror so to speak is over’ in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said that Damascus will continue to ‘bring this sacred struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories’ both for terrorist groups and ‘all foreign presence’.
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counselling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the warlorded country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘certain western countries’ of ‘exploiting irrational escape’ that causes the refugees to stay away.
‘We have addressed the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns’ he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation’.
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great defensive position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement removed a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, as ‘will be wiped out’.
United Nations Mission Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to prepare a post-war Constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem put forward conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to «review of the articles of the current constitution» and warnings against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-elections in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers likely hope, national law and scandals put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what undoubtedly would be ‘the most dramatic conclusion to a presidential ever!’
At the moment, there is no sign of right of sight.
Since 2014, the best transmission time numbers have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the cable ratings with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news items.
‘This is a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand anything’, said Neal Baer, programme director of the ABC Designated Survivor drama, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedy maker and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club», has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him to vote for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Announcement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened human being when you become seated for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of 'deep-dive in background fabric' for the book 'Fear', Paul Manafort's leather jacket with ostrich feathers worth $15,000 (a garment speculated with hybris', Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trump's, eh..., anatomy.
At least I won't look at Super Mario the same way anymore.
‘Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night’, said Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about Trump’s varying role crew and daily twist on the plot (crack with NFL, shamer Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be hung up on.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27°C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged himself in and looked at the MSNBC while he took up the CNN.
He couldn't tear himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is meeting the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we made all the crazy old-fashioned programs and people said this is the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most regular intermediates of the Houses of Representatives
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experiences a stream of money after a conversion of a convention district that ended up fighting two seated representatives on the same seat.
This newly developed district of Pittsburg, with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in an addition election last spring, is part of this new district of Pittsburg.
Lamb opposes another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps with the 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a constitutionally illegal manipulation of the electoral districts in the favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign finance race between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in a closely followed addition election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given small leadership to democrats.
USA Considered penal measures against El Salvador for support to China, then drew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of ‘the recent decisions to cease Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert, the official of the Department, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cut-offs in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year that was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
However, by mid-September officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in the middle of October, to show the importance of the administration attaching the assembly, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson at the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the chest can be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of legal proceedings, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is reportedly also in the process of expanding the review to whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in our choices.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of preparing to meet the voters again and perhaps finally a jury of his equals.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump's case is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
We all have to be elected on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938 the German officers stood ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The time of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hard weather ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret interceptions of the president and wondered that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times is incorrect.
‘How will we react if the recently launched FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is approved to the highest court despite credible allegations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote under the inter-election of a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of the experience I got in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me abducted to light sabbatical lights on the table with the crosshairs.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?’

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistically before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, confident that following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, victory over the Austrians will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee-wrecked obstacle midfielder Graham Dorrans in doing his first performance for the season in the draw match 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game and thought we could get to something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could have taped into the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better at first, and we got out in the second round and were the best made.
Thursday will probably be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last match, but with the home audience in the back I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there's a good feeling now.
The team's good and the guys kiss; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, add the previous season behind us and get it added."
Women lose night sleep because of the fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be taken care of, there were few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
‘People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to make that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to the spouse and the children: You can't prepare the family to give you care if you don't say what you want in advance.
Discussions with the adviser and family where and how care should be given, since such choices may be of great importance in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: The consultant can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
The long-term financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Clear legal problems immediately.
Get a health authorisation in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that your health workers will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider empowering some of your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Think that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please enter the details in a summary so that you are prepared.
«It is not just the economy that is at stake – who are the doctors?» asked Martin.
‘What medicines do you need?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep that overview in place’.
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun as he was on his way home after an out-of-court.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, his stomach and his hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a ‘unmotivated action’.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses.
Soil and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a heavy earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death rates are expected to rise.
Communication is inoperative and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala Government, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government that extends along more than 300 km of coastline in the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region under provincial level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the carriers of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency management.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also met western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the Seismic Ageing in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a strength of 6.8 hit south on Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with strength 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of strength 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that razed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the government of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the kings of the mortal earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
It was not triggered any tsunami this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most in the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, laboring with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Paline is held in Mat-Su prison and is arrested for an unsecured bond worth $500, reported by KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself ‘not guilty, absolutely’ when he was asked how he dealt with the guilt issue, reported the network.
Palin is confronted with three Class A offences, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined 250,000 dollars.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with one day in prison and a 2000 dollar fine.
This is not the first time it has been targeted at Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being conducted in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic violence, dealing with the report of domestic violence, and for holding a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His lover claimed that he slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she attached her son's violent behaviour to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia tsunami earthquake: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The Earthquake of strength 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just at central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami plunged into the beach.
Federal prosecutions rarely seek death sentences for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are seeking death penalty for Sayvollo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he aimed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘willfully’ and caused serious bodily harm with intent, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued the 22-point verdict, including eight warrants for killing in connection with money extortion, on the face of Saipov, usually used by federal prosecution authorities in organised crime cases, and a warrant for vehicle violence and wreckage.
The attack required ‘significant planning and planning and planning’, said the actor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as ‘hesitant, cruel and corrupt’.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, property and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci’, states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York led a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to perform espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after having seen ISIS videos on the mobile phone, according to the screening.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He did not declare himself guilty after the charges of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were ‘obviously disappointed’ at the decision of the prosecution authority.
‘We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life span in prison without a release option will only prolong the traumas of these events for all those involved,’ said Patton.

Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be “feeling pressure” from Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom ‘would have been wiped out’ now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided rows has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a self-demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Supporters insisted that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Bone told the message-out demonstrators in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and that the negotiations with Brussels should be held.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand by Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan’.
When he was going to explain his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Bone dismissed claims that the referendum had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong’.
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I say quite simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
«The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public; the opposition is not going to vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who trample the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening’.
In a direct message to May, she added, ‘State Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises’.
Farage stated that politicians would be ‘feeling pressure’ if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the trust between us – the people – and the politicians," he said.
‘They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know they won't get away with it’.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.'
While marching Remainers through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland’ he added.
‘It is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considers to be a presidential candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "estimate seriously to stand as a presidential candidate" after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the democrats from Massachusetts talked about the future at a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elects in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been at the heart of the speculation if she is going to oppose Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to be a presidential candidate.
Warren said it’s time that “women come to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top.”
Arrestation after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
‘Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result of it’, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on site and carried weapons, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a charge and was held by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two meter high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starting last season.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims towards the world champion's title after Stallordre gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's stablelords would play a major role in the course.
From pole Bothas got a good start and sweeped almost Hamilton off the track while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to run in the back part of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels that made the Ferrari leader reluctantly let the inside be free after a double pass to defend himself in third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led for much of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get to a quick exit and the captain Kimi Raikkonen who was as number four.
He finally entered the depot on the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikconen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good tosspan,” said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her confirmation that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee. He commented instead that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are ‘unreasonable, false and speak untrue’.
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and rotting and talking untrue," he said.
"When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I have not done so.»
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you been playing?
Remember her answer... you licked the document--' oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not leaked’.»
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't play,' he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to have the leak come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't lick her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for."
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who commented during the party event on Saturday evening: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to take power back with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got in two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants received early a two-way management via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they hit Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third session of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the three previous battles.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford put up the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put up to Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the management at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced once again with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the late second round during the game, and he secured the victory with the team's five half way out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia will be shelfled as soon as he dies and ensures that an aircraft that had many hundred passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missed after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftermath continues to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled to life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway right then, could safely light up.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts burst when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that death rates may rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster response agency reports limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
‘The numbers are expected to rise further since many equals are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach’, said the organ spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have shaved Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "At all times you see ambulances picking up deaths.
There's a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are being flushed everywhere’.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross works febrile to help survivors, but we don't know what they want to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse».
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country’s military: ‘I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?’ said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Fly crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing. They reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The air carrier said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately on request for more details on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still on hospital on Saturday, and the condition until all were stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the bomb was on the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew very low.
'It's a very good thing,' said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through mid-deep water to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the airmen had panic and screams, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a brew also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution authorities closed the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as expert witnesses in the field intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile printing to jiggle the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was a struggle against what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the phone to Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the actor asked about Tellis spoke true when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he «saw because my trailer was in Nashville».
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He has removed her from his life," said Hale.
The defence shall be scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the matter to be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is social hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the singer by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the origin of political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-owned hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new bloom in the United Kingdom through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Children's Care Seeker Couples for Termination after ‘racial’ Notification
A babysitter in New York sues a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving an error sent by her mother, who complained that she was “another black person”.
The couple rejects their racist nature and compares the case to ‘expressing’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for the first working day in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEEII EN SVART PERSON’, wrote the Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the tabloid, there was an “inconvenient” Plasco-Flaxman who quit Maurice, claiming that their uplifted babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for his one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the cancellation and demands compensation of 350 dollars per day for the six-month, losji-based scheme she was promised, but without a contract.
‘I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t,” she said to the New York Post on Friday, adding, ‘I know it’s discrimination’.
The couple have turned back to the charges that they are racist and say the termination of Maurice was the only right, since they did not feel they could trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something which she had not intended to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
The comparison of the case with ‘expressing’ says Plasco was due to his wife having only two months to the term and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
‘Is it such a person you want to punish?
It is not very nice», added the stockbroker.
While the legal case goes on, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that the readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to sit in second place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She said the father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book of a small raccoon, would have been delighted that his work had been rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book release was 'bitter' after he left last year.
She described Paddington as a ‘very important family member’ and added that her father secretly was very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boastful person," she said.
«But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who makes a joke: you are proud of it although it really isn't your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself.»
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked so bad, that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, my friend.
I'm coming to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine doctors had given her to make the heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in the body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it happened.
I could not howl and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together.»
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the tests she was going through.
"No one knew," she says.
«I looked down all the time and tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with grieving women to prevent bridge suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide, work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers folk can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was struck by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him on the smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I'm always worried that there's going to be an infectious effect."
Sharon made the cards 'to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, although it's just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself--you have to talk to someone.»
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt down or depressed or something," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas 1st, he was in the cellar – when the kids opened the Christmas leaves, they didn't get eye contact or anything."
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they must struggle through it: "There is a big hole in the family.
It rips us apart.
But we all have to stay out and fight”.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigating
‘I thought that if we could get to some of what he asked for – a time- and extent-limited scrutiny – we might reach some agreement’, said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee ‘fall apart’ along locked party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to the timing.
The middle elections are only five weeks away, November 6th – if the Republicans are likely to make it bad, it will be considerably more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and run lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary to Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him installed in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean skippers «falls» below Kim
The number of North Korean deportees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-zeug, which refers to data from the South Korea Ministry of Collection, said there had been 1127 drop-offs last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human trafficking were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented publicly.
Most of the deportees from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korea War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which have the longest limit to North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China regards the deportees as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South — which is technically still at war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the fixed negotiations on denucleration.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
‘Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally calm down first’, said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the highest court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in supreme court.
Pelosi gave the opinions in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
‘I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called hysterical’, said Pelosi about her reaction to the Kavanaugh’s testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost cried out and was crying when he talked about the family and the years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a ‘grotesque and coordinated fall in character’ organized by liberals who were angry at the Hillary Clinton losing the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he can't sit in the highest court since it shows that he's preconceived against democrats.
"I believe he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh into national law if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the highest court, but also in the right he is currently sitting in," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the interview, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would review certain maximum court decisions.
‘This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the highest court and expect us to applaud it,’ said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair agony, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
'I don't think that's so weird, do you?'
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she said to the person she spoke to "you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And that's what I thought was amazing."
Tears are allowed as an end to hares because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started to cry with unexplained rage and was caught in the neck of an older woman – a cool boss I had always been a little scared of – who took me to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
‘They don’t know you’re furious.
They'll think you're tired and happy because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was acting as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to cheating against the spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of making himself a presidential candidate.
‘It was not a thought-out decision’, she said with a laugh 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last ones they needed were one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she lay behind with the funding and swore that she would not stop if she did not get in at $2 million.
There was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the support players who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?," she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and to reach voters instead of delegates, as well as the minds of sexism — that she fell into tears.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press spoke of her.
"You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my tomb stand?
'She's crying?'
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the fight is far from over, a break between countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing customs duties on important Chinese export products, including photovoltaic panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation happened this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has returned every time, now at the latest with a five to ten percent hit on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Making Washington descend means giving in to demands, but official submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
Experts nevertheless say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give a positive outcome for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic repercussions in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have seen in the past,’ said Abigail Grace, a research colleague who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ for the return of refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to repatriate the country, which has been shaved after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
‘Today, the ground situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism’ he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral financial measures that affected their everyday lives and their livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will accept well the help of rebuilding the devastated land.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after winning Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who squandered during large portions of the tournament, swept his tea-beats into the water at pars-3,16 holes, and had to see himself turned off by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant at all his rounds and became one of four golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got their current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was turned out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finale.
With all eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind it, the Spanish Sergio Garcia tournament's most winning europes were over time with 25.5 career points.
‘I don’t cry, but today I can’t leave.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He leaves the stick stick to his compatriot John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
‘I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in the rise,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now has a registration of 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklaus.
Team United States spent the whole weekend finding the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury spoke out after a disappointing achievement for his troops, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
That was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves out.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were struck’.
