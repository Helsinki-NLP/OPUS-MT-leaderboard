You should have attended the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the mistakes, if there are.
My conscience bothers me.
Many homes were washed away by the flood.
Why Care About Them?

Are you wearing gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my dad, do you?
I am now-now back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.

We want it back.
The game begins tomorrow.
They can overcome their fear.
This can't be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
Recently, Father returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know all about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, do not trust him.
You should have visited Kyoto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out all you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we should have thought about him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Late in the fall, when the weather was rough, windy and wet and the cold could enter the thickest garment, especially on the sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.
At night, all cats are rough.
Quiet!
This is my house now.
A bird flies.
He arrived 30 minutes late.
He goes out to an English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
What a man sows, that he also reaps.
I wish you had said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I am far bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I've been looking for a place to stay.
Tom has a lot on his plate.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next one!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot her clean.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be that easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
It's really good!
The river flowing through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
