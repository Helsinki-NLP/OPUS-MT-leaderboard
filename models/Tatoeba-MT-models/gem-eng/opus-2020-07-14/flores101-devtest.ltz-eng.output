The aristotle, a philosopher, has theoretically spent everything in a mixture of one or more of four items. They were yours, water, left and celebration.
This was more than the 4 aggregate places of matter (in the same line): fixed, fluid, gasme and plasma; although it also theoretically has it switch to substances, to form what I see.
Institutions are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many items in the periodic table.
Elements like Kalzium and Potassium apply as metals. Of course, metals exist as well as silver and gold.
