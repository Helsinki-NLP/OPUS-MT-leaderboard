No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted, as part of a amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regime, which could have paved the way for the release of the arrested Prime Minister, rejected the second reading of the request to reduce the penalties for economic crime.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of a allegedly adverse agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid, and in December the appeal of the convicted is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself calls the judgment a political revenge of the regime and also of the West caused the trial to rise to suspicion of preconception of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to withdraw from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes had to be adopted.
Libyan Sieg
The history of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the victors are to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists prevail in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council recognized the customary right of Sharī
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft you're just chopping off your hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible, be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran in the future.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would be hardly imaginable in this country and above all hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively seen, probably not the best and would hardly fit the Libyans mentioned.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were helped by the faithless dogs.
To their excuse, it may be only the fact that NATO's air raids were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya?
We only took part in a shooting, served the interests of Islam and our politicians discharged themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally without any advantage from this.
After the fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred Libya's military occupation.
As a result, the Hiesigens are left with concern - namely, the expulsion of the cruisers.
Can the oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without being incubated?
Surely the West can at last justifiably boast about the protection of human rights.
If they do not destroy this, then the shards.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in comparison with the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
Both countries at the same time corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (increased by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated and according to Czech Statistical Office, the trend of growth slowing economic performance was confirmed.
The results are thus worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Throughout the euro area and in the EU, between July and September the economy recorded an increase of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the analyst's expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yields from their 10-year government bonds rose by 28.45%.
Return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
Return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes are made, and the ECB is to become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their 200 million qualification
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-designed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent gate by Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, the Czech football team was able to defend its luxurious advantage from home play and will once again not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
Thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, the Czech selection also won quite happy 1:0 and has thus redeemed their ticket for the football-EM.
They also put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half of the year because of the precise defense game of the Czech team accounts.
The peach birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will thus join the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that the domestic football prize will amount to about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, quite fighting football was played.
Both teams combined long and so were played mainly around the middle line.
Even in the second half of the year, the pressure on the home team remained low, and the large reductions in the crime area were successfully resisted by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday afternoon before the property and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Iranian Isfahan formed on Tuesday a living shield around the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to know that they were willing to protect their country's core program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran had apparently not given up its efforts for nuclear weapons in the long run.
There is also talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press from the center of Isfahan, the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan's attack target would also be paralysed in the event of an attack led by the intent to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program.
The menu of a fat child: it does not eat and eats to the dinner sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys have shown - adipous children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
So once again it shows how important for the healthy development of a person is the environment in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often found on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had their dinner bread on the day before under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence".
In families with Dickerchen also sport is not just one of the favourite occupations, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find themselves at least once a week time for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, surveying almost 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Hospital and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of the children interviewed said to eat breakfast-second breakfast-vesper dinner in the mode five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of the pupils' families had breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone breakfasts for themselves.
The worst was the finding that in every tenth family is not cooked at all.
Breakfast is considered as the foundation of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey showed that in the families of overweight children they consume much more often unhealthy French fries.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed are sports, only less than half of their parents are doing so - i.e. only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
A further part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own menu from offered options according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer to eat between 12 and 15 is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Emerging is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonade", the final report highlights this survey.
At lunch, that is, the main dish, pasta just beat up with poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very small.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In many cases, a marked shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition has been noted in the results of the project in the control group of the survey participants, which completed the questionnaire after completion of the informative presentation "Adipositas is no coincidence".
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limousine, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat fewer nuts or sweet foods.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article about how stylists learn, I had tasted a bit that was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn't know what was going on.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the test moves, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we debated with director Alena (at course not a single man) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportioned figure.
And that's at least most of us.
One has one too short neck, the other one too young without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is the thing of the stylist to visually cascade wide shoulders, extend the neck or create the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - with big breasts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-like, without it being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hip is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece cut to size.
You will certainly not regret that, because well-seated clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the poles that always stand up and slides, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, trousers, applications, embroidery or ruffing.
With this amount of information and figurines, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do in view of the assignment.
Each of the students was awarded a prize for which they are supposed to design suitable outfits - day clothes and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to attract Miranda Kerr, who might know you from Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I cheered, because this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably grown to the hundred kilos lately (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes from magazines or search, print out and then print them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also creates the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday talk, filled with information on the types of figures, was just as spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by Stylist Jan Pokorný, by fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion is and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And sent-in stylist manages to work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, i.e. like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to curl up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of it was the following council: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"You must first hurt them," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we need to break all these lessons, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see completely different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So with all that, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, that also confirmed us Jan Pokorny.
You just need to watch Madonna, a not brilliant singer who made an image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic one is rather opposed to the services of a stylist.
Also known personalities often consider this to be money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something that I look secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to make sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has returned to or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put us to the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on the fashion and then the outfit needs to "build up".
In his work he must communicate above all with the people he steals and he must be a weighty psychologist.
People appreciate without offering themselves and standing in his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to screen their wardrobe and to add nice pieces, then we can't clear her whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"At least you have to find some praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what such a so-called "slatch bag" must contain.
So a bag that you tie on to the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are thrown behind, if they are too large (signboards or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric is not broken) and of course seams.
In order for us not only to listen but also to try out something practical, we learned how to properly stick shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, silently outside.
We were glued and we were glued...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors so you don't damage them.
So you really have to do well.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we got to hear on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to dedicate to styling on a professional level is not a game of children.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree ride is avoided by a series of dilettantian mistakes on the routine journey to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what it would be useful if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the barn tables, the new part aroused high expectations with the subtitle "The Run".
He promised to move the already-year-old series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstrations, he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages are going, where the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But how you get used to it at NFS is much different in the end effect than you expected.
Sure - potentially it's pretty decent arcade races, but overall, the game is mutilated by some superfluous errors that are present in this series for more or less a few years already.
So there are actually no mistakes anymore, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible folly of game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, it is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty single races.
This means that each race is performed on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment to think that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing moving around the world.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or up through deep snowy landscape seemed visually very pleasant.
Over and over, untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly restricts vision.
In the mountains, in turn, one has to be perfectly careful not to be wasted by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are well installed in a row.
Just a few, but they're rich.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against the stopwatch), then expect another personal duel with a single contrahent.
And that's what the police are trying to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is, however, surprising that there are far less passages in the game than one would expect (in particular, only three).
In the end, this is more of an advantage, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model steps into the feet of the preceding parts.
In other words, from today's point of view, it doesn't tear out trees, on the other hand, it can't be said that it's bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations have to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race continues to be quite justifiable, although you could find better in competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only appear after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
A game of this kind can hardly be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no impact on any object knowing how the car behaves, then obviously everything is not okay.
Typical example: When you overtake or pass by the cars you "straighten" in some places the other cars only slightly, in other, almost identical situations you get into the slippery and spin wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, it's all annoying.
The reboots are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, you throw the game back to the last clue on the route.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once they've been exhausted, everything goes off from the front.
So the reboots are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you better not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even the reboot helps to learn nothing but the critical section from the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Otherwise one encounters "civil" cars in the corresponding position in the same configuration, no matter if one comes first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the contrahent comes by before a playing on two arriving cars, but until you even get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is designed so that it comes to this situation always close to your nose.
Contractors have additional advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
At the craziest, this is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which you happen in opposite direction.
The contrahent must obviously get one of these devils out of here.
And then if he's already in front of you, he'll take a natural view, so that you start driving your own car a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it misses the joy of the game quickly.
And that's a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is completely entertaining and sometimes also so charged with action that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "debt" is about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't get bored, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the race.
You should not miss the gas stations along the route, because you can change the car here, although in most cases the car is enough to get you right.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history goes also the task mode (challenges) - the races in the individual localities known from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher driver level, different objects have to be unlocked: start from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected at the same time to the Autolog online function, which among other things compares its own achieved results to those of other players and also provides further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you get to a subway tunnel (meinest roads) by car, where you ride along the tracks in the dark (meinest roads).
On the tacho look at numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (meanway), but there comes a subway at once from behind and drives a uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial team we'll probably be arguing for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designer or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying it is that, at some exciting moments, the frequency of the image recovery is slowing down and this sometimes is quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit at all.
The sound playback is as far as O.K. and the sound track is tasteful.
In the effort to reach as broad a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lay "of everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game were not mutilated by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks somehow unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to put these faults in the eyes of one with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Joint Revolution" with singing ensembles of Karlsuniversity
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the suffocation of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samtenen Revolution and this including music experience.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has brought the balance between the individual institutions out of the lot."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five or six years to smooth the waves and get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador of the European Union, quite sharply speaking at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "understanding and openly about Europe" she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and its mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have enjoyed so many lecturers at the Faculty of Law of Karlsuniversity.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new Permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was voiced that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown such a role, but I must say that everyone was breathing how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them, and who, above all, has clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, she then said in response to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies towards states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our oil cap quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Union lived and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency two years ago called it a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The government’s case during the Presidency was a major negative, which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all its hands to do.
With the words of the Ambassador, not only did it go to the Presidency, but also to the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And it is still necessary to approve the EU's Seventh Year budget, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "understanding Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's horrible shorts, foreign words and professional jargon that nobody understands.
How should I, as a citizen, know whether we really want to cover ourselves in Brussels with curds or round cucumbers and various large bananas, or whether we really want to ban the quargels.
It would have liked to use the ground of the EU to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Viewing Europe of two or different speeds
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive the negatives more than the positives.
The weak representation of the Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
Many factors are to blame for this, including the restraint of our candidates, whose inability to write motivational letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovakia is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me means, "Hey, what do you put your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and it makes a pretty angry mist.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU is especially expecting tough rules for the budget policy of the Member States in the future.
As a much more real, as a "European Federation", she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone here.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time it has been said that only the countries that want to work together and those who do not want to do so should be quietly absent."
"There will be more and more institutions of this kind, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds", she expects.
In this respect, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle, according to which all issues with an impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of his existence
If one wanted to look for a proper word that the strategy of IBM was the most precise, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although since its founding a century has passed.
The basis for this longevity was already laid on her first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the internal magazine, which IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture that was thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not shrink back from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will do even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Concealed system
Watson has been operating social care for his employees in the thirties - similar to that of the Czechoslovakia entrepreneur: The IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well thought-out pay system for the best new and merchants.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally well established.
From the beginning, the company was ingenious in talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world raised any discrimination against IBM - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is also to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year with a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been attending IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken up the position of Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas in the company, almost half a million people busy.
An institution with a reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inwards and outwards.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said Harvard Business School professor Economist and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research added.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present only on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of its familiar "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM has the most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial weapons, bar code or the diskette.
With about 220 billion dollars stock market value (market capitalisation), IBM was the second largest technology company (similar to Apple) this year, overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The Look Ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unhappy were for example the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not bind emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, they're leaving again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM's winnings are largely part of services, software and hardware, with a total of one-fifth of each.
In 1990 hardware with more than fifty percent of its share was the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-bearing assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis sweeped the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the middle of the major world economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM manages the current crisis without prejudice.
Since 2008, the value of the IBM shares has increased by 120 percent rocket-likely and the company's clean profit is growing continuously.
The company logo of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values can not be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to all-round flights
Founded a century ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Corporation.
The name IBM took over it only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later IBM company laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous Stechkartnuhren to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who also held the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of the competition company, to help him with the company's management.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas until today the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as already the name reveals, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash.
In the first four decades that Watson was running the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he spent all forty years in the boss chair, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped manage NASA flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also to the famous flight of man to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, she bought the consultancy part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in not even planned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and in urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help retailers lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM founded a branch office in Czechoslovakia at that time - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-level top research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her spouse Josef Rychtář (53) became her lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, you probably wouldn't even have been dreaming about how that goes with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth on her pushes after 30 days, Joseph went straight away.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile again with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the run.
Rychytář doesn't care who's sleeping with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," Ms. Rychtářová wrote, but she also said that she had already separated herself emotionally from him and remained alone on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina had locked the back door for him has given Joseph dignity so far.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper husband and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the land, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I'm having a normal time, we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I realize that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I accept any responsibility.
The worst female misconceptions: How are you?
If you ask the men to call some typical female mischiefs, they shake some out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitten revisions happen again, which let the men roll the blood into the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does her husband ask them to be a shopkeeper?
Do you have to buy at least one hater every week?
Would you like to go shopping and may it be a bit more in action?
Then it's probably really about a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their purchasing appetite half-way under control.
But hand to heart, which woman already dares to walk in search of a well-seated upper suit only through a dress shop and not to try out all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for the men it is often the pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times they've told your husband?
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Don't I get too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
"Do I ever like you?"
Is that somehow familiar to them?
Yes?
Then you may also be among the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean that you should be allowed to go, but many men react allergicly when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger gender is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more unbearable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Wash windows, wipe tiles and dust, scour the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you smear with your partner, because he once again tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, you peel the kids because that just scrambled sink is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and the order and cleanliness of family life are not the first priority.
In the end, this measureless impurity can also damage mutual relations and, above all, peace in the family.
Pieces
Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket.
"Do you really want to put on the old socks tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirad, don't be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course that's not bad, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to taste so much.
Clasp and Tratsch
Some women would like to clapp and chat, and then they're bullied behind their backs or even slandered, or they're forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to whine through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a bit of harmless clap and tram in stock.
Hand to heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with clumsy caverns of calibre, which is nothing and no one is holy, which probably despises everyone in their surroundings and which poses a significant danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček assisted Philadelphia with their assistants to victory
The ice hockey storm Jaromir Jágr had a big part in the NHL's Monday game with two assistants on the 5:3 win of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who was also an assistant and was selected as the best player of the match, was a member of the nine-thirty-year-old Ice Hockeystar.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr claimed to have prophesied a great evening to journalists.
"Just before the game, I'm telling him that he's succeeding in a hat trick."
I kind of felt that way."
"She and again has such a feeling," Jágr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought behind the Hurricanes gate of the Puck and presented him between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third then belonged to the flyer again.
Mr Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr he scored his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he certainly is one of the best three," Jagr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have imagined in my life that at the end of my career I would play with such an ice hockey player as he does."
"I'm delighted."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players put their game on me and now the spear is turning around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made the game still a drama - through the matches of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who got out of a penalty shot, came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one.
"Excellent prongers still worked in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) pulled to distant paws."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it worked out," Voráček described the last hits of the game from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenseman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and resigned in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens, in addition to their experienced Beck, also paid for their leadership in the Penalty-shooting 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to change one of the penalty shots.
More than the points lost, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game ended only with five defense players.
"That's bad."
"We only ended the encounter with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done, so we have to finish," said Jacques Martin.
"Each change had an attack wave after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We'd have to make the game easier and get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended with a series of five defeats, five different shooters participated.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five state travel agencies approved by the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies sold mostly travel to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, and in the West they were only allowed to select.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when Yugoslavia was also allowed to travel, Yugoslavia took a pro-western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern bloc (also the Czechoslovak) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel to Poland individually or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
The travel agencies also offered travel to the west at the time, but then you had to buy huge snakes or even stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
That was not the way things had been going for a long time.
The so-called currency pledge - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The 1989 revolution followed a journey revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which one is not even aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
Just from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, foreign exchange obligations were lifted in the neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could for a long time get from their travels to the west simply not enough, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech holidaymakers slept in the park when traveling to Paris in the tent, because who would have had the money for an accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of travel abroad from the Czech Republic was a packed trunk with canned, beer and permanent sausage etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech krone - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and therefore the average salaries increased, which resulted in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to regularly prepare journeys through charter flights after 1997, making the journeys impossible thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, with the exception of the United States, the Czechs had already currencyless payments with all highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-general" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Every year, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying in far-off sunny countries, and this year 12 exotic destinations are flown directly from the Czech Republic.
100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which made our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than CZK 15 per head for a single holiday stay, including the cost at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a Patt threatens.
For almost five months now, the Czech football team has no chairman and threatens that Ivan Hašek's successor at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement as to which electoral system should be chosen.
And without them there is no vote at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
In June, Hašek resigned from his function, calling on his colleagues on his resignation to find some and a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era of Hašek the old querels broke out again between the two federation chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiation led to no result, and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the plenary session - only the siting representatives or also the officials with authority.
In this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which, in the opinion of a representative on a proxy basis, was not valid.
However, disputes about the electoral system continue.
The Executive Committee, too, no longer gave any clarity in the matter at which meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - are in principle no longer on the agenda at all.
Although the views on the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is, how should you proceed in the third round to avoid a patch situation?
"The issue concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether to find a completely different model," Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
In the third round of the candidate who receives greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running, according to the siting model.
Moravia is allegedly ready to compromise that the candidate who wins the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, is on condition that the winner receives at least one two-third majority in this percentage vote.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which found it best not to bend the electoral order, but to vote in accordance with valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclik is also in agreement, even if it is noted that the electoral system is most likely to meet Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is that as far as possible be chosen according to the statutes."
"In order not to design any unreasonable replacements, such as at the last Annual General Meeting," said Victoria Plzeň, the owner (the football club) who was the first to run the competition and was mainly opposed to Pelta in his opinions.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national team for the football EM today would certainly contribute to the calming of the moods."
"If the football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater," says Jablonec, a member of staff who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at professional, regional level.
Rajchl's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, contradictory."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "righten" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a further blockage at the general meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations should allegedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football overall will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter aircraft to which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among other things, were supposed to fly to Podgorica, could not even start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so one looked feverishly for a replacement variant, as one can still bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage game.
Finally, the Ministerial meeting is crucial, which is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have moved the split parties within the country's largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the confidentiality of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which should guide Czech sport to the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes into the struggle for the chairman's position because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclik, the head of the Pilsner football club in front of the extraordinary general meeting, could have made a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have agreed to the struggle for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and refrain from choosing."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclik ČTK.
The main reason for Paclik to go to Duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is thus to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclik also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to perform the role of chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, up to the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager, who is not too much involved in the football business.
"I spoke personally with some of the people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some of them told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclik allegedly disturbs the connection of Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegation meetings on general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclik that Pelta had the position of the chairman.
"In his victory, the present state would be preserved and in Czech football it did not progress at all."
"The support provided by Berbr, a clever businessman, gets the football twice bad," said Paclik.
He also pointed out that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone hearings to investigate in a corruption affair, but that Pelta was criminal.
"I don't know which prestige a victory of Pelta should bring in football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Mr. Paclik, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta became chairman," but already sees something more calm.
However, if Paclik won the Thursday elections, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclik before the general meeting in October, who ended up with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) was the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the Federation as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand," said Paclik, who, in September, had taken care of replacing Dagmar Damková with Lu
Paclík himself claims that he felt the role of the association chairman grew.
And he is referring to his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which persists in present-day situations," said Paclik, who does not, for example, make a fence out of his antipathy against Sparta Chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, whose help he would lobby the political top politicians to see more money flow from the lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new Chairman should devote himself to".
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they must also tell the rock and clear where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Paclik as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the Chairman of the FAČR must be "superparty".
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"I don't think it makes much sense, either, to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after one and a half years," Paklik made it clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will end a pat situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised to strengthen in the event of his election that the FAČR would receive a new statute, which in the future excludes disputes about the electoral system from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday's debate in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will be deflected with any success of the Czech election.
Pelta had promised before the unrealized election in September that he would like to concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of funds in the event of his election.
He only decided at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about the leadership of football and present his ideas in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for the association to be led by someone, the man who is mainly connected to the Jablonec Club, who also worked for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
This is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as they had all accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
He used precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizen's Association as a means of attracting delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I would assume it personally and be prepared to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a principle without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to limit himself to his contrahen.
Earlier he had announced that he could introduce himself to a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledged because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclik, too, has not attacked Tomáš Paclik for a long time, which in turn left no dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"But his attacks were diminishing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's also why many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his contrahen, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest game classes to the national team.
And this should be the Czech football hanger.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the aftertastes of the corruption scandal of last year."
"After that, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said ČTK's forty-six-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his move to the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleanings.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandingly nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates do not travel to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If really the only disputed point should be, as one chooses in the third round, then we get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly crucial day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR under him begins to work hard
If the former Vice-Chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected Chairman of the Czech Football Association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would seem to be a blow to many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous President Ivan Hašek started.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, professional football, to professional football, to youth football."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything by myself," Rajchl said in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football can advance in every segment with milestones."
Many would not be delighted because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, consideration had been given to no more candidism at all.
"It's known to me that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who do not throw me undisputed knots between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"Many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise it would also do others."
"This is trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently, he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work and I don't want to just throw that away."
"There were processes started that might only come into effect in a few years and I would only regret that she would stop someone," he said, expressing his concern that in case the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would choose to return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him stand above all people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones."
I guess you can throw some things at me, but not that I'm partial."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because everybody is doing well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicted the claim that he was only a president of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian section, whose winners then joined the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl says.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclik has joined the struggle for the role of the chairman, Rajchl is reluctant to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, who has elected me as their deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of ten million crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the Lottery Act as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames the fact that the Federation does not draw on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to regain confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclik to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably carry on with the things that Ivan Hašek has started and also the staffing in the Commission would obviously not change in principle."
He wouldn't want to bend things to his favor," Rajchl judges over his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planknecken in Ufo-Optik, Punkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience his blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in spasms.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past one and a half years, one in her luggage was not allowed to miss: her bathing suit.
Looking back on the water, she looked high in artificially designed domes, she swam marble-cuts waiting for them at the edge of the basin, and marveled at carefully restored Art Nouveau pools.
If she liked a bathroom, she took it up flights in her notebook - including knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now she introduces her in her book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swim culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much on her hat with sports, says Meder - just in the water it's different.
It's only unfortunate that swimmers have to settle down with blue tiles and chlorine tank, while jogger can breathe in the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to happy bird changers in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
Splätscher in the jumping pool and ethereal sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have made trouble, swimming halls can be a real eye mutilation: "Sitting a floor you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand, she is transparent, but on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture band "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis, but above all makes a desire to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an ancient Karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, the basins of which are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termáfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While the entire city is in sight from the Zurich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the skiing slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open up it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder took the smell of chlorine to the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong for heating oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose lick sticks one to the skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a special wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatshoewitz, she found a locked terrace.
The bath, designed by Dušan Jurkovic, was closed in 1902.
When Meder threw a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weed grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has counteracted the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction are already behind this bath; one can discover not only neo-Romanic elements, which come from times of its construction in 1844, but also an Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of the pool-canner Iris Meder - and not only because it was originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge so different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool seems to be only minor.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business on agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the Group wants to have consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Germans, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks therefore have a share of the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche-Bank-Chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Originally, raw material bets were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the sugars have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to consider the allegations and said that no business was "valued to put the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank at stake".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the examination will be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the bank's top will then tell you what consequences it has.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete withdrawal.
Ackermann based on his image
Foodwatch-Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann is now the highest bank lobby in particular.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all facilities from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether it is Mr. Ackermann's case of hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprisingly at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not switch to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
With a return from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to shave - this would eventually have to do his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material facilities
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager up.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Thus, just eleven percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer plants that are bet on food prices.
Many banking customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each second would terminate the survey according to the survey of all plants in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 received prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and conjured up.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is flooded with clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the Bressler World Exhibition in 1958.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then given the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made so famous to the architect that he also built the pavilion at the next World Exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowling side construction in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Viennese Südbahnhof and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called it.
But the building was not suitable as a spatial and technical museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long, until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, now called "21 house" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a lucky occasion in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007, took over the new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art historian with considerable careers, among others, in youth as an ice art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, emphatically implemented the reconstruction with politicians and monumentists, obtained public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal occupation for the execution.
Not only because of his sensitive conversion and expansion of Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and winning the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer's University of Technology in Vienna and was the pavilion for him a "very important place" in which he viewed the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost to generosity and ease in its transition to Vienna and its re-use.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy sledder," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold-bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two lower floors made room for the new use, a lowered light tomb between house and street ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been painted in the old reddish-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema hall is even exactly what it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a small budget.
"It was often necessary to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough floor on the lower floor.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It had been difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "wake up a proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban accident: around the Swiss garden, the newly planned "main train station quarter" is created, with offices and homes.
And another luck will perhaps come up: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions of height
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn spends over 70 million euros in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The "picture" newspaper reported in advance, calling for a group-based crisis plan, that by 2015, investments were planned for a total of around 300 million euros.
This should improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in the case of extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway systems and to increase rail to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platform platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary distances.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube had warned against train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter the train in passenger traffic had considerable problems, as it lacks reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railways Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it needs to test axes of ICE trains significantly more often in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Hauptbahnhof had a broken axle.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in the USA
After the tumult of head Josef Ackermann comes new ungain from the USA: Deutsche Bank must pay a million fine there.
As if the problems for the Deutsche Bank were not enough at home, the industry giants are now also bringing their past into the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars in a comparison, 1006 million euros, to settle disputes over the destruction of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
NCUA, the financial market regulator, proposes a whole series of large banks to have seduced cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
During the financial crisis, such papers were strongly lost in value and the banks were falling into the depths.
"We are pleased that we could solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German-Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not incur any debt by comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of $20.5 million.
The NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps in to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the damage caused by billions of dollars.
Now the comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also predicated on other major banks and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage documents in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on mortgages.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a crime of many financial corporations.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers flipped over.
Although the events have been back for a few years, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless complaints to obtain restitution or to inquire about failings.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It proposes 18 international major banks to have overestimated the two state-owned real estate financier Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of about 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint against the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that Frankfurters stand straight for "substantial losses" without, however, mentioning a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unstoppable and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IBM IT company.
Since March he has bought up shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies is only poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a knight in the financial world.
As a result, IBM's IT office may now call itself Sir IBM.
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economics channel CNBC that since March he had bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had provided decent profits.
"They did a great job," Buffett said on the strategy.
For some time, IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, for example, Buffett went to a freight train with a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich-back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost insidious sense of earning money has given him the nickname "Orakel von Omaha".
According to the announcement of the Buffett investment, the IBM share pre-traded by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange and is one of the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now revived.
The murder of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is heard with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkish people, a long-standing, dead-belief ghost returns: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that foreign hostility exists in Germany was never in question anyway.
However, the detected right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions, the dimension of which is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology resuscitated?" the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasises that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities too could be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded in a sobering way: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a night watch in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Agreement.
In cheerful colours, it had been staged together - as a story of success.
Like an earlash, there is the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftiest" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" too cannot be taken to draw this thoughtful link.
"It starts to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the action of the police and their success is discussed extremely critically.
Why it would not have been much better for the German authorities to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some show themselves at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be slopped here, nothing but self-defense and arms will remain".
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of the Enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means, when inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s made clear.
The photo of Solingen's fire ruin is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right violence.
However, the attacks accentuated our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the error of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was mainly accused after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire attack, he sent a note of condolences to the Turkish presidents, but at the funeral in Cologne, he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech at that time counted on how many charges the Turks made.
Quite so, as a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks has been in the present rule of law ever since.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive clarification and reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, we need open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
In the financial crisis, UBS went almost bankrupt and has been slipping from a crisis to the next.
Now it's for a German to judge.
I'm sure Axel Weber wouldn't have thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would enter an almost spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Schweizer Großbank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber welcomed herself publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new solidity and let friendly comments about future colleagues fall.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
A retailer of UBS in London had bypassed all of the bank's security systems and swept around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been regarded as being beaten - and all questions: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been announced that Weber may consult the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes hard.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and bankers, and he would certainly have needed a start-up period.
With one blow, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been cutting off a scandal in the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is the once proud Swiss bank being spared.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the staggered and solid, but also buffed Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a big number in investment banking.
Thus, in 2007, the UBS managed, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars, more money-generating customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she was promoted to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That's what made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "My students at the time I always presented the UBS as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli was surprisingly retired, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, one wondered why he had gone.
The bank's investment segment had been embroiled with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to boost this, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of say and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors for this, but who, until recently, had humiliated some people: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which had been so hidden that they did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, President Marcel Ospel, the second-paid Board of Directors of Switzerland, in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the collapse in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank purchased UBS for ten billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change loan, which she could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the Swiss economic performance (see graph).
"Now we couldn't save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was the second one.
A few months later, the UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of capable customers who may have had reduced taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions, including fines.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chairman and Chairman of the Management Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business segments: investment banking through misconceptions and asset management through tax evasion assistance.
And just when it got a little quieter again, just when you thought, now the UBS will get back to it, then this unsavory dealer story follows: A single dealer choked up 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes obvious: the risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the case of Adoboli, one has to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's Bank Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become guardians of the world's great wealth: not too great risks, for security of money - even beyond the Alpine republic, it might break down the world once.
The Tresores of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fit the cliché of the dedicated Swiss private bank - it is only a bit bigger.
Already the location is classic.
The bank has its head office at the Zurich train station, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank, through the palace of Credit Suisse, to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside, the walls are marble-dressed, before which there is a large sign of the "Safe" next to the bank logo.
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has forced both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point it has been delayed - or betrayed, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, but, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two major banks.
The UBS had become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Angelsaxes had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing more to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the manners of the angels."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which changed the UBS, first gave it high profits and then the Debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On 15 October 2008 the disaster was seen.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million-million-land decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, allowed politicians to save the big bank that is facing bankruptcy.
How could that be?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a large group.
There was a bank that was already too big in the merger for the small Switzerland - and grew more and more.
In doing so, the two different predecessor banks of UBS were added: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came to a great deal of money with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors at that time.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, humble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked himself up from banking teaching to the top."
But at the end, Olpel depended on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly: Superstition came before the case.
Employees of UBS are clearly reminded of the executive meetings, on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same Parole: Goldman Sachs of the Throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go up there.
You've already succeeded in a few steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played at the very top.
However, corporate consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that cost her almost existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime facilities.
She developed into a huge machine that packaged and extended securities on American mortgage credit, but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than planned.
Posting at the UBS became a sleigh seat and is still fragile to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has disposed of all the related business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo brother-in-law was actually only thought of as a transitional solution, when the bank was surprisingly separated from the predecessors of Grübel.
In the meantime he has asserted: He is to conduct the business of UBS on a permanent basis, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to move the investment bank back to the middle of the nineties.
He strokes 3,500 places.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money for?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself now.
Publicly, he's just saying that he's going to be looking for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Threatened industrial production on the continent suffocated hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been half-full in the past week, not half-empty - but now again the problems were in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values recorded at the trade close with a minus 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer ranged between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251, a minus one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a decrease of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is turning to the end of the upturn.
Enterprises produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
This was skeptical of the US investors: "We're not an island, we're dependent on it," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of recession so quickly, and there will be further signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett's investment legend only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks from his point of view.
Instead, Buffett threw an old principle over the pile for decades and entered the US technology industry.
His investment in IBM over ten billion dollars was based on the stock price of the traditional group and initially had it record against the trend in the trade first just under one percent higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to his own data and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's shares were significantly higher than the market with 2.6 percent.
The house silverifies almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and invests 6.6 billion dollars in it.
With the net gain from the business, the institution wants to raise its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and calculated the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Including options on 20 other machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased, and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, revenues of 1.38 billion shares were 630 in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": However, from the cities the highly intelligent animals cannot be driven out anymore, experts claim.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the townscape for centuries, but in many municipalities local complains accumulate about the dirt and noise of animals.
A means against the "problem birds" has not yet been in sight.
Seed cows were no longer to be gotten out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian emptiness.
There, experts from all over the federal territory are offering possible routes.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also brought the problems in cities to bear on the rural flight of the especially protected seeds: the chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crowds are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs can be found in the Westfälische Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had taken care of negative cycles.
Critics had described catching the animals in bird traps and killing with knuckles as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the grumbling, brings nothing," has the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver discovered from empty.
Spraying nests with water or falling trees often have undesirable consequences, said also environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, large colonies split up and distribute elsewhere."
Excavation can only be considered as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out of here."
Without the surrounding area the problem cannot be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said of emptiness.
It is conceivable that a combination of the animals’ disguises of sensitive living areas and lockers should be used to relocate them to other places.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws" opposed the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "At last, we can bear a pimple in the face with the best self-confident."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, on which signposts inform about the life of highly intelligent seed cows.
The project is now already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication that they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed cows not only use tools to get to a treat, but even make their own tool as an aid.
Behavioral researchers from Cambridge University recently tested four seed cows, as far as the intelligence of the birds is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they had to crash a scaffold with stones to get to a moth larvae.
Without much training, they recognized purposefully what size and shape must have a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the puffy crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid wires on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket at the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seeds were even able to do so.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland are at the 2012 EM.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Located by the double successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal struck Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive EM-participation perfect after the 0.0.
In the play-off reverberation game at outside Montenegro, the Czechs reached a 1:0 (0.0) after the hint game (2.0) had already been a clear thing.
There was no more burning in Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a looser 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80).
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trading meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed to Portugal in the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a start to a degree.
Ronaldo chased a free shot from about 30 meters to the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide-screen quality and met at 2:0 from 25 metres.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of an hour, had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table guide Manchester City put a head ball at the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33).
Jiracek meets Czech Republic
Afterwards, arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the center.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic surely transformed.
But after the break, the vice-president of 2004 made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the final doubts in the 81st minute.
In 1976, the European Champion runs to the EM for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to pass a startling second.
The final man Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the border of the penalty room just past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crossblade had to save for the already beaten world class tower of the Czechs, again the storm of the FC Seoul had dropped (50.).
The gate just before the end made everything clear.
Turkey thus missed Zagreb's football wonder.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come beyond a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hidedink will have to clear its place on the Bank of the World Cup Third in 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM round.
Before 31,000 spectators in Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost won a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even lower the impacter in the gate.
After the horror, however, Croatia became more and more in control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made the 62nd minute for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic place, the Bundesliga-Legionaire Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni travels to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM-participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the run-up, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) awarded to the guests.
Ireland had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment did the Estonian team of supporters prevent the possible lead.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After a failed defense from finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was in position and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were to flow, and the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and employ corresponding employees," announced Co-Chief Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers sit in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.

Currently, the business of the software provider, who employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running as well as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)", McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China based on comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Emotionally and generously, Peter Englund's new book "Beautiful and Scary. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of main characters that one goes to heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments in which you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and apprehension" is almost the war experience of 20 more or less inconvenient men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others extinguish.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the West Front.
"Beauty and apprehension" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, a festive Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsets fly are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane named Katrina, who smells like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance.
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what's going on or why this war is going on at all.
"Few facts," Englund notes, "are furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and apprehension" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or gripping, but they are extremely alive in Englund's small moments of gathering lost in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help themselves.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper bonds, wooden knots."
He tells more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in hay fat (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were coated with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes, which were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories deal with honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "One feels that, despite all that, what was intended for men rather than sitting in the loft chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to do so as meaning such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarians behind his own strengthened and lamented shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take a distance from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man hanged in secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe, which is falling apart, and from new kinds of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a scale suit who slaughters while he is sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is as peaceful behavior as heroism.
The soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexual disease in order to escape the front ministry are speaking in an frank manner.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in trade with gonococs-Eiter, because soldiers bought and lubricated on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were truly desperate, pushed him into the eyes, causing them to be blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is smoothed and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which the war "uncontrollable forces were unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are bringing them to battle.
The best books on the First World War were usually more falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it back.
But it's as if with his book, he got us this page with the main characters in front of his nose and lit us with a match wood.
After an early misstep a minute planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of whom carried helmets.
One had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at this time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. All others believed in an exercise at first.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the houseowners a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - anti-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "in the last minute," said someone familiar with the commands, which meant a declaration as "exercise".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreat when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including emergency services from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that throughout the day many people go into the park and out, almost like commuters, so that 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park stopped," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were ready before the descent at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the news recorded beforehand, which roared out of the speakers, seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials stepped into their light blue wind jackets in the park, many protesters simply gathered their things and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 p.m., no tents would be attached to them to give the protesters time to pack their goods and possessions together.
Other teams of officials have been seen gathering in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the police president, said this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching police action in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west by the big mess of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grasses and clothes with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which lifted, which had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Images of this were released on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were linked to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30.
The room was closed after police statements after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, due to "indecent behaviour and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department of criminal officials, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not conduct the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case of access, a second group of officials was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a roadblock north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be observed how these police sites continued to extend the surrounding area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place was observed, as several officials, many of them with signs of protection, drove persons outside.
About 28 people were in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a Protestant came to the hospital.
Trade union of the caregivers will file a complaint against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school managers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inadequate influence on the schools teaching poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity open to the trade union, County Council 37, in its efforts to reverse dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees in the city and who had lost their job in a chess train on 7 October described the trade union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups last year with which the budget gaps were to be closed.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that there was nothing in the budget that would indicate that school assistants would be released.
Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Ministry of Education about a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference to formally announce the filing of the appeal before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be brought by Mr. Walcott and the city's Ministry of Education as defendants and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in a position to file the complaint and thus their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of redundancies at the schools in the poor districts of the city to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more help because they are chronically underfunded.
They show that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost in the 23rd district of Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants were released in the 8th and 9th districts of the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school helpers who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of notorious parents who can organize donations to pick up budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the High Schools were led by the language in a memo into the error which authorized the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (translated German) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's salary list to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were released, not transferred," said the draft complaint.
Mission finished, Congress ready to communicate with Libya
In the end, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already understanding about the uprisings in Libya.
All this was necessary was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the termination of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee for International Relations will decide on a resolution, which will be held by President John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mute".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, the legislators of both parties and the White House argued about the choice of words for a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day this law passed in the Senate. In addition, the board passed a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission came into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a convention that was brought up enough to criticise Obama's approach within the scope of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him off the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripolis fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates Libyan people with their enormous courage and exceptional endurance in their self-liberation" and "glorifies the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Board of Foreign Relations, or will they split the legislators, as the law of June has done?
The last version is based on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's leading republican.
Lugars spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every congressional period of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or another area to be voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their changes to the vote, although they have often tried it enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to Congress and to the Senate - others only slightly deviate from one another.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners to Republicans who want to polish their CVs - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary compensation.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that Congress members can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the restrictions to two president's terms of office.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a marriage among the same sexes is, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags, an ever-returning template.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the states reject them.
As zealously as Members propose changes, they move at the same speed as in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators made 77 such changes. at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment, which is to add - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was already proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Fired, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man had shot at her during a Tucson election, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night. She alone sang to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to the congress.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ranked according to words and needed help walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which divided its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned to Congress surprisingly to give her triumphant voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope."
The special follow Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf above the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nick with his head.
A tug with the lip.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: one sees how congressmen sing "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" together with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article in a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and for the first time asked about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is imprisoned in Missouri and is treated medically while he is waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated," Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever.
Coping With Forces Rather Than Respect
The event was a Wall Street gala collecting millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines gathered around him on a keyword.
The amount in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring donation campaign.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, but it was pity.
The sharp contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be overcome with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, servants say.
The public increasingly behaved as if they were suffering the people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support him is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to be ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger of the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks of pity in the silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they had defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "enraged, violent veteran was hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from battle.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to hold the negative impressions against it," explained Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as usual in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., the U.S. troops in Afghanistan ordered.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a civil servant.
Forces find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the severity of their injuries.
The military is facing the growing pressure to get through in the event of rape
This week, an important hearing on whether 28 women and men are being charged with non-interventional rape before the military court.
Should it not be possible, hundreds of plaintiffs will be ready for the next hearing.
Liberated Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells started," Lyman said.
But the Texan was washing her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claiming she was.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel anxiously awaited a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit has been filed against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and in violation of constitutional law of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C. filed, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, who in the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers’ colleagues, and that the military failed to determine, condemn or provide an adequate case-law following the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem started there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retaliation of the? the leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted almost 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs placing their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many further complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the appeal.
The files of the Court of Justice, which are available for Newsweek, are followed up in detail by the defense strategy, primarily by the fact that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers with injuries to which it has come in the armed forces.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries committed to active soldiers.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is only in name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers' teams increasingly play important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she does not stand alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides them are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for the suspected promotion of a hostile atmosphere.
Of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is gathering a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that was given rape victims in order to release them from service - a common approach, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the administration of the war veterans) in which she charged her discriminatory practices in dealing with service claims for persons who indicated that they had been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offers a number of clues.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e., the Office for Prevention and Notification of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense 3,158 sexual abuses were reported in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases, which come each year.
The report, published in March, also examines the criminal prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military were brought to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspected rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had with her friend before the attack.
Six persons declared themselves to be witnesses in the name of the suspected perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember well the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes were going to be used. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember saying to my commander, when I got out again, that was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was unjustly released so that she did not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he says, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrent that brings with them liability.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will start with their hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having gone into an amok race in Norway in July, had 77 people killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time before his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extra-right groups on the side of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find it?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans on the right-wing extreme groups across Europe and then viewed them with add-ons, but instead of linking themselves with a new band or a new diet product, the addons invited users to a survey asking for their level of education, their attitude towards violence and their own future assessment.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 top right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office.
"It's a rather new method of research," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of extreme right groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is the fact that you can study people through this site, which you usually can't reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook it all goes away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drink problems than students who are silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-ranking students, such as roommates, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would otherwise not have been found."
Facebook also constantly collects the data of its own population.
The site's data team has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 intermediate elections and a National Lucky Index (which primarily used data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make their large data fund available for other research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the site watches them whether they want this or not. To play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to deliver your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything online is allowed.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, for a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in contributions are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Thus, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of social life - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Calt and Inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed two amocassette races in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and a Knight of the Temple of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hateology and thereby support multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't blame myself."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a preliminary speech, the permission to contact the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik under investigation for 12 weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik in sight, others wanted to confirm that he was behind locks and bars.
Everyone took part in the goal that everything goes on a roadblock.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked calmly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had been complicit.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the victim said.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which this week was shown in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans find, however, perhaps most revealing in the recently re-discovered job interview, which was dusted out in the important markets this week before special screenings, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acrifice organizer who worked diligently on diagrams - a man who believed that many CEOs suffer from "a disease of thinking" "that makes a really great idea 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the rise of the Personal Computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs, in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed discussions.
At this point, over 10 years had passed since Apple had forced jobs. And he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist diodes, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing from the delivery.
Only after job death did a complete VHS copy be discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes into the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor extensive interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there will be four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection in which jobs are clearly weighing their thoughts and seeking accuracy.
There are also moments in which Job's perfectionism comes to light when he apparently responds impatiently to Cringely's questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to topics or side-actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview seems somewhat eloquently farsighted when assessing jobs that other companies do in his opinion right or wrong and represents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous tributes to the career of jobs. But to see jobs here as the greedy dreamer, who is on the leap to grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he moved out and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" and the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
I've determined that.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize accounting with Apple.
Surprisingly, how costs were recorded - usually one started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere assumption and then adjusted with "difference" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the Pope became aware:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and conduct long distance calls for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm, when he describes the blue box as an act of self-determination, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable telephone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while they loop through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe for half a dozen times, and when you cried on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says jobs looking.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be any without it Apple.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to speak to the Pope, while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomats, the two had to laugh off before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone call, jobs for the summer received part-time work at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment deadline of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he remembered the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember pervasive arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15.
Over large companies that leave behind:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants, with their visions in stumbling and lost control of their shares.
"Do we say, you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copy or printer, well and?"
They own the monopoly of shares, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [there are such people], which ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of the decision-making process.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly position, is eradicated by people who do not have a concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times larger, could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
You won the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it runs out to taste, it runs out to try to get involved with the best stuff that humans have created and then try to bring these things together into what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who are by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of the health laws, as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divided question of whether to listen to a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was an action brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which was decided by Congress last year, a law that became a slogan for conservative activists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result of which is likely to be the start of the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law is too clumsy will probably be Paul Clement, once the prosecutor general of George W. Bush's government.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business that contests the law.
Another sponsor was Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case at a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican Group in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the federalist society for years.
And this does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may participate in the benefits events of law nearer and other organizations, while the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the programme, not be a guest of such an event."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the related law firms as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the contrast to the Codex punishes the actions of some judges lie, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, of a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinner during a Benefizi event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would mix court matters too easily with groups that can be led by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagen was a Attorney General under the Obama Government when the first legal disputes were brought before the Court of First Instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, because it was too much engaged in defending the law to be unprejudiced.
Kagen doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing takes record orders from 18 trillion dollars ashore
Airline Emirates ordered 50 dual aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 other aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 trillion dollars.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is a record total of 18 trillion dollars.
The client of Boeing is equally unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars in the coming 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest contract for commercial aircraft at all times on weekends, measured by the value of the order: 50 dual Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced in 2011 that Boeing announced it at the Dubai Aviation show an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that will raise the entire list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Chief Exchange Officer of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because less than other airlines tend to cancel or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural security," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large space aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in check, which attacks the premise with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would shift the introduction of the largest A350 that is competing directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses apparently election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported Gegner Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race around the governor's posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for the governors in the western state from the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they have occupied election booths, built street blockades ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have hit Claderon just barely, which had been in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the split and unsuccessful left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during an election for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have risen out of fear of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how stubborn the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the president's office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory makes us look bravely into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growing economic nations need to do "everything in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who are "passive" looking at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support for European leadership and resources through Asia will help to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"That is why everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis," he said the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian interest costs have increased dangerously, and the prime ministers both of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is causing fears that the global economy could collapse into the recession and led to calls that the leading emerging economies would have to join forces to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the falling exports and the dried-out flow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else we'll find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or even less live on the day.
"Someday they will find out that the Greeks retire with 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep many and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" throughout Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ threatens "the risk of classification" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and significant capital emigration of their sayings.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible incisions in defense
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta called the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security without notice. So he triggered a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil gangs.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the coming decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of 600 trillion dollars or more will be necessary if Congress cannot complete its spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in the achievement of a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop of many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unminded way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to dissociate ourselves involuntarily from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with the certainty of bordering probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were eventually hit by the combat forces," Panetta said.
"While the interception did not directly affect the wartime quotas in the anti-terrorist campaign, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the efforts of the war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the recruitment supervision that would support the war."
"The staff's salaries would be reduced, which leads to late payments to wartime dealers and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of seizure by the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as a leading military force in the world."
"We are vehement against this Draconian act," said the Senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and there is certainly no one to push us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their intervention should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly unblemished the possible cuts, although he could gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a darker picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force scout without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force of struggle that lacks morals and alertness and is unable to absorb it with potential opponents."
"She's making someone really angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions "created significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global employability and maturity, leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Striker fighter pilot, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground-fighting vehicle that Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If one stopped the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to unearthe a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how thoughtful and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The presidential candidate of the Republican, Herman Cain, is concerned with becoming the master of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides lie to each other.
The lead of Penn State is accused of the crime, as reports allegedly have been withheld after which a retired football coach boy has sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy charged US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a fool when he circulated denunciations that were very quickly refuted by inescapable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is charged with the violation of campaign financing, which is linked to the seizing of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced the media circus triggered by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shuddering in school and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the test answers so that they themselves were good at their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send a message that lies and foams are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered a lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To know lies or to "discover lies" is one that is important for every person, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharaden, in which the goal is to call "Hab dich!", detaching a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at respected universities that carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths have been deterred from the lie.
Lies look into your eyes.
They don't always stutter, stutter, rot and tangle.
However, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to uncover and defile.
A trained liar can pervade the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the subtle facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of deterrence, and it is clear that deterrence is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding out in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, awakening their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as others perceive them.
Thanks to research, we know that the extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men are more "self-centered" lies than women whose lies are more "orientated" to others - in general they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that if a person was defrauded as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone usually keeps tripping with his foot, so that they do not unjustly accuse him when he triples with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of prominent verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of detonation.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their story. Maybe they show their feet in the direction of the door or they lean toward the exit, change their position significantly or show a "spanning after the adjustment call", these deep, relaxing exhales and the change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questioning often falsely signals that an interview is over, just to keep an eye out after this relaxation after the interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's outback is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in all.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... to the best of my knowledge ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often makes the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic to defuse lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which defrosting is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Contestant oil pipeline plan is revised after risk due to delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which provoked trade unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to redesign the project so that they can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that one will redirect the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliamentary building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline is finally approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on federal approval for the project would be delayed until the new possible process was verified, which avoided the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may delay a decision by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Last week Obama stated in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico in Canada.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but they love labour markets, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, dare to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy said that the main inspector of the Ministry requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that has been commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle was accused because she allegedly forced a toddler out of fear of breaking up
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of its Manhattan building had suffered a torturous attack that would have put her little daughter in such fear that she surrendered for fear.
The tirad of the "Lady Marmalade" singer, the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, was so afraid that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten girl, and Genevieve wanted to start a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to smear - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tap water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed to the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked in writing for an apology, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a compensation not specified, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said that he did not charge any fees and the family plan the money they get to donate to the cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it's put on a pediatrician's face the day that an 18-month-old baby wears on her arm."
Climate atrocities slowed the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, in Sinaloa unemployment and undeclared work rose, while foreign investment went down and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of the change and made great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climatic hardships, growth cannot be the talk but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions of jobs in agriculture but also limited the growth of the national economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter, mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which slowed down further sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of land used in agriculture were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially.
The decline in economic activity until November has steadily increased in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, since from January to March, 55,053 people had no employment, corresponding to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. That is 18,969 people more than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year dates back to several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented, the policy of the public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with loss of liquidity on the market as a result of the cuts in the average by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are forbidden to raise dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that increasing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is due, on the one hand, to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here which makes unemployment rise," he says.
Blacksmiths' wares
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is even more serious if the high proportion of undeclared work is taken into account, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 percent of the country's employees who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages in the whole of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaryía del Trabajo y Previsión Social (government agency for employment and social care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5352 pesos until September, which is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Reduction of the ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, the biggest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretariía de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI from January to June was 630 597 dollars, which corresponds to a drop of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from Tertiary companies.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis, in July at the National Congress, the government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé's inability to rule clearly.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Maats Chamber of Manufacturing in Mexico) stated that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the government of Mexico.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It must be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and we need to make double efforts in 2012. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made economic development of the country difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slow economy, which is not sufficiently in motion to produce an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana ( Mexico Business Association) in Sinaloa, said that it was necessary to move the State to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would lead the government's efforts to improve.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that a lot of work is ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
Five years in prison and 100 days in prison, a resident of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutors of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military during the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez on guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer carried a small backpack in a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the custodian is still in the penitentiary.
Debt for construction works
The social buildings for migrants foreseen in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes run the risk of not being completed due to lack of resources or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds to which they are entitled, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes involved almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction end is to be expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already over, they have not given us any money, and that, although they had to pay us a bit in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they have already gone a long way, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which corresponds to the amount that the central government had to pay.
"This had already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to purchase the funds that the State had not provided to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the public authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance had been asked to speed up administrative work and to pay the amount outstanding as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already over, they haven't given us any money."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
Conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world over the last few years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the presidential decree and called for the transfer of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree-Law with details on the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
The project for the complaint, which was drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the Decree-Law unconstitutional, since the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) was responsible for the regulation of radio and television, which would contradict hierarchical principles and legal reservation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies submitted constitutional complaints against the Decree-Law. Following the adoption of the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and applied all activities to set up digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the appeal filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree to the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by means of general rules.
"I also do not believe that if you do so, the independence of the regulatory body would be impaired." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, as it directs state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in a better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the exploitation of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which had not only technical aspects, "because it covered economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "needed to act on the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
It called to mind that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It was not possible to conclude that the government intervened in the powers of the Congress with the publication of the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots individually in Michoacán is considered.
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is close to 27 percent, with 879 votes in total of 6074 not yet numbered.
The possibility of the single counting of the ballots is a reality this year in the Michoacán elections, because according to the data published by the Programa deResultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet numbered.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Elekctoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that only last 9 November the electoral office had adopted a number of regulations on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they did not enter into force at this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Public Prosecutor within the time limits provided for by the argument or objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional appeal filed by the local legislature and judged the Ombudsman's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" since it did not have the right to "determine or veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, the possibility would now be that the local electoral authority could count the ballots in part or in full.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more ballots may be partially counted The results of the protocols do not match; the record of the counting and calculation of votes is not available or is not owned by the Chairman of the Election Committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, if there is a difference between the likely winner and the one on second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, the total number of all ballots may be distributed, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
Voting may also take place in their entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages that have been partially counted would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is about 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 have not yet been counted out of a total of 923 election protocols.
His last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirming the family.
The remnants of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rose this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the show of the dead and a Mass of the Dead took place.
According to family members, the last will of the colonel was that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila in an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, together with the others in the accident. The most prominent persons attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the Colonel's ashes landed at the wedding hall, located at Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technology Institute of Saltillo. This body show was commissioned by his former students from the technical abitur and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread out over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant-in-chief had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he has lived in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that he had even at the age of seven after Zapopán to graduate his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A last farewell
The lieutenant-in-chief of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was elected under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the head of school and the students of the Saltillo Technology Institute, where he studied in 1985 and was outstanding in both his studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he had flown, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were killed.
At 6:05 p.m., the circumcised remains of Bacio Cortés, the citizens of Saltillo, met to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the courtyard of the barracks. His family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned body was found on a plot at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in various body parts and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at mile point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several temporary people saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall was piled up.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons, which they immediately told the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another one that was dressed with a white top.
Almost a metre away was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been killed in another place, as no shells have been found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that write an organized gang of criminals to another, and several entries were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for State Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a crime committed mainly in the town of Cadereyta and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunts) and secret funerals.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested in Los Alveros on 11 November and a prisoner was released.

Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to take refuge at the sight of the military.
They are subject to secret sentences in the places General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Education of the new Italian Government on Wednesday
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce this new government, which will present the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce this new government, which will present the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that the Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm government formation.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocratic cabinets, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the President with the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles were overcome.
The "frame is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has led to an unbearable level of debt costs.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by the European politicians to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush on Monti was exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, resulting from which Italian government bonds were taxed at 7 percent interest rates for 10 years, which corresponds to the situation where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confederation of Industry Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in all our efforts."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
The success chances of Monti were greatly increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to retire on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Mid-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, for so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocratic governments, which are just Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying the reforms could once again cause a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Federation of Foreign Banks also exerts pressure on the Italian Federation by pointing out that a failure of Monti was a disaster.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening is scheduled for the end of the session.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breath towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would withdraw, the lack of certainty about the success of the new Prime Minister has reached the cost of Italian government bonds again critical borders.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue shield.
Monti said that his government would have to preside over the elections until the next elections expected in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefer the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by the pressure on the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more play opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the bat.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 convocations has 50 games behind them.
A big difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game that takes place today at 15.05 in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-color team has only Michael Umana as the only player with over 50 international games.
He scored this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie will be gained from complicated secession games at the Eurocup and the World Football Championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the context of the Concaf, which is on the FIFA rankings at the very bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last record: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who on last Saturday met England (low 0-1 in London) with 126 matches with the former gatekeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition last week from the UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team, who had achieved the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the mid tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and near Michael Umana are the left side tower Junior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games appear in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
Out of the national team, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Eddie Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic Spanish gatekeeper is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet moved Costa Rica into its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that when they play in Costa Rica, a dream will come true for them.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour at the celebration of its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they perform in the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 7.30 pm.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is just the second time that we are playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I was only once on holiday in Costa Rica. It’s such a beautiful country that we’ll probably stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, and they experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years, for standing by our side.
We spent almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have needed until we got here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've been doing in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We played on some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't set limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have not played anymore into the repertoire, we can maintain our focus better and surprise them because they call us the reasons we have been thinking about why we liked these songs. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band once, and that also for over 20 years, seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together now.
We like and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are well friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then, a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to be still friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this raised Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has remained together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) met with us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I think we all appreciate being happy, still alive, and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to drop this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, you remember that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created, without being obsessive about being a famous rock star. That has never interested us anyway.
What are your memories of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until Andy's death.
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I listen to a song or see photos, I remember what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that pleases him.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first to come to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion show?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they’re still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney do better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit light-hearted. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
Both came to me with tears as I heard Ed play it. It's very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - this affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly affect me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examination
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated four times and controlled.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would be investigating for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish for this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated on tongue cancer four times and he has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs were reported by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Espeziales de la policía prison since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, who was secretly operating during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
Official rejection, led by President José Mujica of Uruguay and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to discuss trade between two countries and political issues in the region.
Mujica meets his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his scheduled schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the president's office of the South American country on his website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support in the incident with France, when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that are still acting as tax havens, which were rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has since November chaired the G20, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrial countries. Since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double charge with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to speed up the concreteisation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with countries which have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing trade in goods between the two countries.
With "Super Mario 3D Land", the weird installer enters the third dimension
For 25 years Super Mario has been tirelessly fighting for the rescue of the Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the shoptops of all the world this month, was cut to the properties of the portable Nintende 3DS console, with which can be played without a special glasses three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar Álvarez, the director of Nintendo's specialized press in Spain, assured me of the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game developed from the beginning for this console" because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "suitable" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less-fucked users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time. However, to overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the "optic effects", must always be played three-dimensional.
This trip Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has been no longer the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo will twist the fans of the Saga and repeat the recipe for success of the last editions: The curious installer must overcome risky cracked platforms in order to free the Peach Princess.
However, the player encounters news about movements, the environment, disguises and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom is responsible for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take delivery of the former Governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible in the United States for the US $70 million confiscation of money laundering.
Thus, the trial of the US's request for Portillo's extradition ends so that it can be brought before the court there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he had not intervened in court decisions during his government and had accepted all requests for extradition which he had been notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both due to drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000 - 2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of 120 million quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign, which was preceded by the extradition, but the minister objected and reinvigorated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organisation have led to important results: In this quarter of the century, 6,000 young people were supported by the social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs are created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by over 300 people, was taken into account yesterday.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous leaders of institutions and institutions who worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions in election times demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is “a good foundation”.
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new to the association and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house, where giant parties were held, was cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes Nr. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupants left the building last afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 at the street Balmes have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the building they had illegally occupied and organized huge festivals that had led the neighborhood to despair. The room took place on judicial order without police intervention.
After the enclosure, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the manager.
The houseowners who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the others were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They had also painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business had decreased by 80% since the beginning of the household occupation.
The owners of the discotheque pointed out that the houseowners made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had been shown by the neighbors due to disturbance of rest, while according to their statement the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the houseowners and in particular by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and who, according to statements of the angry neighbours, became more and more and longer in recent weeks.
The person responsible for the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that it came together with the owner of the building that they would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from their neighbors in recent weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the PP (Partido Popular People's Party) of the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for immediate clearance of the building and the problems of civil cohabitation as well as the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the occupants of the house had invaded all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in the last few months. In some, thefts had even come.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday another building was cleared by the Catalan police in the Nou Barris district.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched as four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the dispute over the fees, agree to the tender.
The urban invitation to tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its confession on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park was again in the eyes of many to the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few, which does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountain) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
Now the central park was no longer used as an example, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
So far, when the city was issued in September a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access shops to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's going to put gates on the land.
The question arises from itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The call is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurant theme to which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can draw.
And precisely this fact offers the fabric for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán it is "necessary", after the attack on the coast to talk about the "front on the mountains" as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out on the green apples.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he's well-accessible.
Collserola is more complex, the architect judges, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "Lexical trap": one must not "represent it as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which carries "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of the design of a public space nowadays" following the experiences of the 1980s which had their "swan song" in the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation to what can be built.
"To limit something always means to set the next step," i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [related to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who sticks closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that doesn't go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "receive deaf ears" although he is grateful to the city administration that she has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he states his "difference" as to whether this technical profile is the multi-disciplinary team that was created in life ("just the right one," he says) should lead "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, as the tendering terms lack a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-sectional competitions written out," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no long-range perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
This has led at least to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, resulting in a soft transition between city and green areas.
Casino leaves Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red’s agent freed the Monterrey mayor’s brother from the trial, which is conducted against him for suspected extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the Casino Red's agent awarded him the trial against the mayor of Monterrey for extortion before the Second Criminal Court of the District.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is seen, which supposedly compels him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the prosecution, the prosecution opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he supposedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he remained in the Central Security District for only a few hours, as threats of murder were presented against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as an insasse of the City Prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, was sent to him a prison order, which stated that after the almost two-month investigations there was sufficient evidence to speak up Jonás guilty of payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bethouse in order to open it in return.
On this Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina to release the punishment to the mayor's brother, which is why he is set free in the next hours.
During the judicial hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Minister of Público, García Gómez, asked if he had repaired the damage and which the owner of the house had declared his forgiveness. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
According to the case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken. Also, no appeals against the proceedings can be filed, and no damages are claimed.
After the hearing of the authorised representative of the house at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the City Prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been released and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake and other seven persons died.
The Secretary of State of Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons were killed indicate that the helicopter was struck directly against the ground with its entire intact structure, without the pilot having been able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight before the launch.
"The fact that the propeller wings were in contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, while the helicopter lost the hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"When searching, no aircraft parts were found at other locations, which concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigations as soon as possible, but they could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Aid Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor President flew on the flight speed hit and the aircraft fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, raised six relevant points that should be taken into account during the investigation:
Visibility:
In line with the flight standards, this was a flight in accordance with the rules of the visual flight. This means that the team must have had a sufficient view during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the flight towards the border between Mexico City and Mexico State, some clouds were hanging deep.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley due to the clouds.
Hit point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent. There may not have been any loss of control of the aeroplane or a deviation from the flight path before impact.
Dissemination of aeroplane remains in a limited area:
The information available up to this time suggests that the helicopter had been impacted from a straight and a side direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground with its pristine structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The aircraft's remains offer at the location of the accident do not close on fire or on explosion.
The final results indicate multiple ground contact.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 ft above sea level. The site is defrosted and shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information suggested that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search on an area that went beyond the enclosed area at the location of the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the unspoiled aircraft structure had been sprayed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to identify the genes for obesity
The National Social Security Institute of Mexico is head of a research project to find the genes for obesity in children and young people who are supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it will lead a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Youth" with which the genetic markers will be found in conjunction with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especiliadas del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 pm.
He stressed that the study began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) and has been continued on the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state México).
If the target is reached from 500 to 600 persons, the study will be continued on the Independencia sports field (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study was to identify factors and the role of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that it was intended that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 should be filled in with the consent of and under the supervision of their parents of nutrition.
They will also ask questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It further stated that on the Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist count), their blood pressure was controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (test for identification of genes associated with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of health care professionals' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that the girl with obesity increased by 47 percent. The overweight also increased dramatically," stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was based because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that an (e) Mexican (in) average was 65% of Indian-American, 30% of European and 5% of African descent, reflecting the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity were precipitating the inability to burn out the excess of energy (calorie) taken from us, so that it was stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the investigators was in a comprehensive study of the children in which they were found to have a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (acanthosis), which point to the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors explain all measurement results to parents and suggest to them changes in lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, i.e. lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short paths.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, develops modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the road surface were to be considered, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 keyholes when the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt coverings were sufficiently damaged, the number of gaps would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Schlagöcher from a technical point of view", which he gave to chemistry on the occasion of the International Year, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the pavement and thus to avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt – the most heavy part of the oil – is a hydrocarbon compound, some of which has a high molecular weight – the so-called asphalt – and the other part a low one – the so-called Malthene. Together they give the street covering its characteristic tat elastic behaviour.
The zähelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and almost solid at 50°C, while it breaks at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," explained the chemical engineer.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible pavement composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, made of small asphalt and then fortified stones.
Each stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles continue to move and generate forces on it, this layer enables a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer will be laid out, the so-called bearing layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e., sand bathed in asphalt as well.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, it needs a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it needs to produce friction.
The most powerful and distributed of this pavement also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets wet, water penetrates the layer and only comes out difficult again. This causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a punch hole occurs," he said, "the cover layer will be removed first, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained during the first signs by adequate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load was another important cause of the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface always had to be proportionate to the vehicle load and it had to be ensured that this regulation was complied with in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research work to be done, such as on asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th disqualification.
Once again Valle del Cauca went out empty when awarding the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the podium, display a silver crown and the band, which she is a new Miss Colombian.
With this night's result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar in his hands, the department has already received 14 mistitles and Melina has joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crowns in their hands. Among the famous misses are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Maya Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result is the decline of a great favorite woman who had shown at every demonstration that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. She was not for nothing elected Queen of Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, title which the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that counts as decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her as the first miss, is that she had not convinced her by Martín Murillo Gómez, the Carreta Literaria Leamos, of the answer to the question "What book has most influenced you and why?".
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, ultimately I think that the book, which was the strongest for my childhood, 'The Little Prince' is a rather profound book.
I am currently reading `hould and renown'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leadships'.
An answer, which was in short contrast, first because of the term 'sich civilize' and second because it had not specifically explained in what way each of its named books had influenced it.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred person, who had all the incidentals and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, public vote on the best hand-carved costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the Queen who could not therefore shine on stage."
And this was noticed at their first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and on their two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she certainly appeared with both, she lacked the strength and momentum of Magdalena and Atlántico's representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned a miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not become queen".
In addition, Valle left the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the International Jury declared Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombian. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, so that she had worked on projects before participating in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriers and the fibroses, which were noted to her in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's trainer, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on my stomach, which was frankly hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of Cromos magazine, believes that the miscarriage of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedure she had undergone.
"The operations are ok, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay them."
Because of this prize, which is awarded the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was created after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was supposed to be true at night. It was bottled up that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to allow them to enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent in one of the international competitions at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia.
However, she will be one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had lost the crown to history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopy from Cali went into history when the man who identified "Alfonso Cano" went into the story.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a Lophoscopy of the Department of Public Prosecutors (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia) stated: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had been on standby, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 after Valle he settled over and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was expecting him.
On Friday night, he flew to Cauca in the helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was suspicion that one could be the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, he should take along the ten finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
Looking for a trail
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali, the tribute given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the engagement against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders file false identity records or they don't have any.
We'll take the fingerprints off them and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house with a thief, because the thief had just leaned up with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for removing fingerprints. But in this case we could take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by snappers.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspected of suspecting and actually agreed on a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is related to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopy of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be removed from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used for taking.
After that, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the residence.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID cards," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as it would be in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is what shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "Empörten" demand the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators collided in tents on the Zuccotti square.
A large part of the town was relocated to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement demanded New York's authorities on this Tuesday when they again tried to enter the Manhattan Square with a judicial order after they had been cleared out of place in dawn and tried to occupy another place at Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators insisted on joining the Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to take up a judicial arrangement that allowed the "employees" to reintroduce the tent at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held on to the command to relocate and occupied a park further north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the response of the "empörten" to the enclosure of her tent camp, which had been arranged directly by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, came to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent enclosure of the square and authorising the protesters to the tent.
In addition, the "Empörten" occupied a new park, located at the junction of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give any exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures itself that hundreds of people have found themselves in this place, where there was also a rejection of religious leaders as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a site in private property) remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing, which is still open for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the premises held in the morning grey is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven by space carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement with them and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the place, which resulted in "some small clashes" as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this judicial arrangement, the new opening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor personally defended the premises of the Zuccotti Square, which was carried out in the morning gray, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which were decided because the demonstrators "dispelled the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to enumerate the place, because he had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," for "some business had been threatened" and the residents were afraid "of their quality of life".
"The morning graying was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have taken since September 17th.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary on the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the woman of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson will perform together with the "crooner" (balladen singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will breathe into a very special virgin Maria's life.
CTV today spread pictures of the TV program, in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-winded porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee - as a virgin Maria with a doll in his lap to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" program by Charlie Sheen, as Jesus' child.
The Christmas program of CTV is based not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far away from this controversy.
Bublé recently named North American Kim Kardashian "Hure" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends free fall spirals from early March
Since the last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in recovery after the destructive earthquake, which resulted in an atomic crisis, and the worst catastrophe Japan had experienced during World War II.
The first estimates of damage to property in Tokyo were estimated at $300 000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - starting in Japan in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unsustainable increases.
Nevertheless, the real change in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynisian attacks that use the crisis to build up or reconstruct infrastructures.
Japan has been awakened, in particular, by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has trusted the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has fled into one of the "currency of refuge" of investors, who are holding off before the Eurozone's debt crisis and the turbulent forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a grave stone on the export companies' accounts.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the Yen listing.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing down economic development in September.
The indicator, which presupposes the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the main economic potential had slowed down.
Because it dropped by four tenths to just 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is 100, after it has dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Makes Doubt Again
Papadimos says that the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums from peripheral countries and wide-ranging uncertainty, Greece continues to be confused in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensence" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days agreed upon in his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would not, in any case, withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise not to nothing."
The Conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that urgently needs the 8000 million that Athens needs, and made it clear that he would not accept a commitment declaration on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated about the effects of gambling with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand should not be met: Economic assistance would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties were to sign "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors came back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "which is "needed" for the payment of the sixth section of EUR 8000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek bull has for a while more.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain has become the second donor to international cooperation in the last two decades. This "Wesen" is based on an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all mankind based on trust in human beings".
Yesterday the Queen inaugurated the fifth world summit on microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially the goal of living the number of persons who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, below the "limit of poverty".
Spain "remains working" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, hoping that initiatives and contributions from the summit that will last until Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of this loan.
"We have seen many successes" and "are faced with many challenges."
The microcredit summit is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for starting "two basic goals".
The Queen stated that it was intended that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of microcredit dates back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia considers to be a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described it as an "admirable idealist who has dedicated herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on site.
This experience followed one year later the first world summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We all have been able to observe a continuous development," explained the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her the assessment as a "family head" in Valladolid and as "pre-speaker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by animateding those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical requirement" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to economic booms at times, as it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy for eradicating poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised states would now have to work "more than ever" on solidarity criteria, not allowing solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always standing in front of closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city "their gates, infested by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to vote for the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14th in Leipzig) was for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but was implemented in the autumn, in particular in order to provide sufficient resources for the activists who today and possibly Italy's future, assess government policy in relation to the Greeks as too late.
The European Commission's proposal, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The stand-up ovation, which lasted several minutes, initially applied to Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The main idea of the chancellor - as well as the requests - is that the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a strengthening modification of the Lisbon Treaty to the budget policy of the euro area countries by the control of the European Union, but this could also be reflected in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give a face to Europe".
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Of course, it is unlikely that 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the issue, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal of weighting of each country in the Governing Board of the ECB according to the weighting of individual economists, which apparently led to a rise in Germany's position.
The chancellor, who is concerned about the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request of the "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of medical reports?
According to the family aid, UMP and the government are now launching the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November in order to seek out a family support fund and give a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the state, which has always been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which stems from the desire to test the economy in a test of hardness, but on the other hand, it is not less pre-emptive of an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government recommends the introduction of a fourth day of the carnival before taking into account a disease report for private sector workers.
In good German this means that a sick worker would lose the pay of four days without the permission of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to excite anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And those with a different measure were more symbolic: to grant government officials an unpaid curfew day in the event of a disease (there is so far no standstill for them, unlike the three days of private carnage).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also re-examines the issue of fraud, this time focusing on the abuse associated with absenteeism.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will be remunerated when this is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November, in front of the channel RTL microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of disease reports seems to be somewhat disproportionate.
This has indeed been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives which have produced the most fruit.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us start with the nation-wide numbers.
According to the CNAM national health insurance fund, more than EUR 237 million of daily deposits were paid in 2006.
According to the Health Research and Documentation Institute, daily settlements amounted to 11.3 billion euros in 2008 as 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave, accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French received an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that obscures certain differences: another one, published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French employees did not take a single day of sick leave.
Another study covered by health insurance this time shows that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with its European neighbours, French workers tend to become incapacity for work no more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Center for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global drop-out rate (caused by disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of medical reports is a negligible part of the black work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak measure is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to the existence of systmatic controls in the case of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million checks that 13% of 285,000 of the completed, short-term medical reports, which is in 37,050 cases, were "unjusted or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were counted in "unadjusted or unwarranted" cases, which is 132,000.
All in all, this makes 169,000 "unjusted" cases to several million workers who have filed a health report.
A figure which represents only a weak exception to, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to UMP member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between EUR 9 and EUR 15 billion of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defrauduation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to capture its economy.
On Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament, along with the fact that the Union's government had not allowed one hundred days to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new programme for budgetary adjustment," said the head of government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the involvement of the country within the Eurozone "is at stake" was as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the state deficit of the country"by 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after this was 10.6% in 2010 and in 2009 at 15.7%.
The rights reject the new savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but foresaw that his party would not stand ready for additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentarian's New Democracy Party meeting.
He had declared himself ready with the requirements of reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy which would prevent economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks entrusted to EU Commissioner, who had prevented IMF and EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties on their support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalised, as an expert body
The Canadians live in denial of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relievers, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a reluctance to death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually insist on talking to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law so as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in the case of patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent EIU society, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the theme of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate at 86% of hospitalised deaths in Quebec is highest.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are counterbalanced with the position of the federal government, which has already committed no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
However, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach to euthanasia and accompanied suicide has been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practical implementation of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by unqualified or unconsented persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations have been dealt with especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as was confirmed in a teleconference yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadian Supports Euthanasia
We note that according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already committed suicide in favour of euthanasia, because they believe they allow people at the end of their life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that a legalisation of euthanasia does not result in the message being communicated that the life of elderly or disabled people has less value.
With regard to the persons who have already practised a accompanied suicide, the respondents represent 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or withdrawal of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the author of the report.
Similarly, in their list of recommendations, they suggest that the criminal law should specify that the suspension of the funds for which a legally valid refusal was sought should not be considered a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the cessation of resources at the end of their lives, and that this should be feared without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relievers, and this went beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the panel calls for pain relief or life-absorbing measures to be considered, at least as little as euthanasia was used to reduce physical pain and to deal with the same procedures.
Subjects of other experts
Some health professionals have already submitted reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
RA Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the reporting experts among others as "extreme" as they did not limit the Euthanation practice in the end-stage.
"This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years will ask another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deshamps, who had read a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deshamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social sphere of society.
But now, he says, there were "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report which she referred to as "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada itself, doubts in particular the reports on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign from power
Damascus pounces a "com plot"
Syria is clearly isolated
The partisans Baschar al-Assads demonstrated in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assads, which, however, resists it thanks to Russia's support and shows a "complot" against the country, has become stronger yesterday.
Two days before the end of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has exacerbated its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the Arab Prime Minister in charge, who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to do so", to establish his office in Syria, which had already killed the forty civilians and members of the government.
"Having Bashar's interest in his country in the heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed at the Syrian regime had not been successful since the beginning of the year.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with this must go," he explained, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is becoming increasingly harsh.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "distortion of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have, in view of the repression in Syria, hit an ever sharper tone," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in the south of Syria have died, as announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSD.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the besieged city of Homs in the middle of "Shussshifting and heavy bombings of Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country "taxed on the end of the crisis".
Incidentally, he responded with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which is a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not yield," he added under the suspicion that "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers in order to protect civilians from repression of the regime, that he would encapsulate himself in his "Paranoia" afterwards.
An extraordinary reconvening of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on crisis recovery, adopted on 2 November, in particular the controversial, probable withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of prisoners of demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lawrow, considered the decision of the Arab League yesterday to be "inaccuracies" in order to prevent possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already admonished Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets for patience and Italy to be ready to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "sacrifices" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's trade unions and employers' association meeting.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is made up relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme involving a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups involved in the discussions after he met the President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had waited until his turn to see that Mario Monti has a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The talks will be culminated in the presentation by M. Monti of a strike list, which will undoubtedly extend from a dozen ministers to head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it was "certain that the markets would be weak and understanding".
His appointment by the President was welcomed in the beginning by the markets, but the disquieting situation had intensified, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister was to establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should exist only by 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Since its inception, M. Monti has undertaken to work in all urgency in the sense of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even in the light of the new government."
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013, despite the savings plans adopted in recent months, has asked for new issues.
Emma Marcegaglia",Chief of the Chiefs of Italy, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic promotion", as a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficital indicators."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epoch Change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolises the "challenge of trustworthiness" and a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown was the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent previous elections, as Italy has now raised EUR 200 billion of government bonds until April 2012.
Russian scientists are helping the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-powered explosive capsule, as confirmed by an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other UN agency documents to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had last week announced its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to a detailed study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was supposed to leave the center to start a company in Kiev that produced "Nano-diamonds".
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In her last report, the AIEA"s strong reference to the fact that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only preoccupied with this technology but also, as a member of the Agency announced, his entire professional career had worked directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin, above all essential to this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes targeted against Muslims rose by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated crimes of violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either declined slightly or increased slightly in the same period.
According to this data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews, as well as a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total "hass-motivated crime" has risen to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% motivated by religious differences of criminal activity, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes grow again," stressed the Human Rights Organization first."The rise in anti-Islamic acts of violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had stressed for a long time that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, an organist.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these abuses," he added, in his opinion, that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards "hat crimes".
The "hat crime" is a legacy of the struggle for civil rights in American federal law.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther Kings' death to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter turns the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, making the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow for better reading of the activities of other "Twitter", the Internet user, whose messages ("Tweets") you follow and follow your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether these allow them to follow their news, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday"in August with a small percentage of users", said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive function, equipped with a bit esotherically encouraging wording (RT for the referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiativeés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation using certain "tweets" via the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and equals too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function "Activity" will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "golden budget rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Social-Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in the Austrian top-bonality (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who personally announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt levels of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay was not reduced to a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Auβenminister.
Austria also issued a call for the Brussels Eurozone Member State Summit of 26 October: The Heads of State and Government would then have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model" since Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, while the government's structural budget deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP from 2017 onwards, whereas regional states should have balanced households as well as municipalities.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the monetary markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would once again intervene in the monetary markets if the yen continued to rise.
If we establish excessive volatility in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday the Yen was in turn speeded up close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
That day Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of taxing a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly increased over it, docked by purchases of investors who regard the yen as "value of refuge" in these uncertain times of world economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro was among the symbolic latte of 105 yen to the vicinity of the levels which had led the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This blasting fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income of Japanese companies from abroad, since they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11 which devastated the region of Tohoku (North East) for its reconstruction," says M. Noda, who fears that this expensive yen could kill the weak upturn in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third world economic power has gained -1.5% for the first time this year, compared with the previous quarter, thanks to the rapid growth in exports and the consumption of the "plombed" households caused by the disaster.
The Prime Minister estimates, however, that the cost of Yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to offset the situation.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Vice-Chairman of the Institute, informed that BoJ had already launched "appropriate measures" which made it clear that there was no additional cutback to the currency on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) in order to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate feet fast to the height, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the launch of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the Eurozone, also operate this Tuesday, November 15, a little more in negative terms.
The CAC lost 1.4% in Paris at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back 0.4%, London 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions over the yields of government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, global stock markets continue to publish some of their recent profits.
"Capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of European market participants of the capacity to continue the debt crisis, had closed with a cashier of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited corridor of variation, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of the concern about the future of the Eurozone is damaging the single currency which continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570 dollars, leaving it at 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has gone back after the CDU, the party of chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, accepted an application which, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very alarming level.
This Tuesday morning the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85%, the Spanish title of which matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed, on his part, that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the Visir of the Markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The "spread" between the German and Spanish 10-year commitments has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting Eurozone growth rates
From a statistical point of view, France recorded a 0.4% growth in the economy as a result of household consumption in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the Baisse's figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts are most concerned about.
Germany, on the other hand, had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first calculation of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If a topic does not exist on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to set up an electoral meeting to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, it is not intended to avoid a huge proportion of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to be able to produce electricity without the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to forget an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident doesn't change any of these parameters.
For this reason, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision on the need to find a substitute source of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which only intends to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to attract another unit to its park by re-establishing the plant Three Mile Island, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is sometimes focused on renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The elections in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, in particular on Russia, by the increased use of imported gas, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already become evident within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in wind energy from which it refers to 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role of competitiveness and a stability path for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the price of energy, which will lead to the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are as unwilling to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us note that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industrial sector with 125.00 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs induced.
Because of its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France were to take the decision to increase nuclear power, the majority of these SMEs would be the victims, and the annual EUR 6 billion of investment goods and nuclear exports would be increasingly shrinking.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of his producer was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that as little as a devil's work there is a miracle means of generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by the Areva company for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that conducts uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as building in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are currently obsessed with the security concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only a single one, in Three Mile Island, has entered the market under normal operating conditions, thus without any consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by the presence of a mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR constitutes a draft that enables them to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition between Areva and EDF by allowing them free train to travel the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvring dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from many angles - the overburden of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy subject to the figures, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the public harassment against foreign students had marked the weekly shows, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "needed no talents, maurers or waitress from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right was Jacques Chirac's tone, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, would not represent a problem for a country" on the left by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990 that France "could not absorb the whole poverty of the world".
There is only one difference in the degree of gravity.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish plumber was shared both from the right and from the left in 2005.
From both camps the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that immigrants are willing to accept.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to banalities, which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron showed us in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among specialists regarding the positive influence of the influx of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Reducing immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than local wage earners, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are technically unburdened.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where local wage-earners are not interested, which are more skilled among immigrants working in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, so this complementarity also has a positive effect on the labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the influx of immigrants causes a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without account being taken of the fact that the diversity of ideas brought in by immigrants and economic growth is beneficial (high share of immigrant immigrants among American Nobel Laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems in the European countries, on average about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who migrates to Germany at the age of 30 makes an average net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring the missing cutting points with the teeth at the time of his mandate.
These said teeth, which the immigrants were supposed to deter, however, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a delicate good.
The European continent should be able to recall who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the whole 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, Totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, and also Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme One in Greece.
Some may have believed that it was rich in exercising the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy defeated once and for all over its enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon"the little one" that it was a feature of mental attitude.
The general electoral right, the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can as well become the "repressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are in, is an economic crisis, but it is as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The transformation of the Greek True-Falsch referendum in this respect would have had a twofold distinct character: one that is the need for a vigorous return to politics, on the other hand, but also those who are concerned about their impossibility, their inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in wrong order.
A free pass for the European single ruler or a jump with connected eyes into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know where to end the list, by the way - because there is only one crisis, and this exists in Europe.
It is all Europe that is bent on the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies that are suffering from its lack of power and its lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
For it is up to the whole world to see whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets, and pave the way for a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has led to decisions at European level which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without surely ruining us.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been over for a long time, everyone today urges European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it presupposes the citizens - this would be a new folly and a further dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We must form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the general good
The World Trade Fair for Chip Cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million non-contact chip cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground with regard to contactless payment after it has been left behind for a long time in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary that banks equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically issuing their customers bank cards with contactless chip in the future," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A decreasing percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out these transactions.
"You've been delayed."
"But they should have a real upward trend at least next year."
"We expect sales of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows for contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would be possible to prepare the market launch of an offer that would allow their customers to make contactless payment via mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The long-standing relationship between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to confirm itself.
On Sunday, Algerian Vice-Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now acquired "certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the relationship between secret services is evidence of clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations of the abduction of two French people in the Niger last January have supported interfaces for days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi are expected to have been killed on the following days at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the debris at the site of the operation.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the led telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but one must undoubtedly wait for clearer evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It is, however, conceivable".
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that they are becoming increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo alleviates.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as have the speeches and the operations modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the withdrawal of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives, which bear the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since that time, the international community, to begin with Washington, has put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long regarded the grouping as a community of Illuminati, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means as much as "the western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
It policies and demands strict respect for Sharia, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active in their increased attacks against the commissioners.
However, Abuja's reaction is as usually indicated.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken captive, is being killed in prison.
As a result, the cult becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, who demanded 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the guilt of a suicide attack that took place in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the UN's local headquarters will be the leading international target.
The formation of an African terrorist axis to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia has alarmed all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and the Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and was ready to report all the information."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
In the midst of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, there is a rivalry in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and aid for Israel.
Can a crisis-affected America lead a complex world with simple to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates this way, the voters could get almost this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their associates have repeatedly made their thunderous statements and their statements on external policy, a traditional republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel-aid are falling - often in no way undermined - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest price Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and to accuse them of "cash manipulation" - the leading issue in an America that is most eloquently provoked by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
It was stupid to imply the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of autism, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions of flattering gestures.
He had called for a firm but constructive discussion with Beijing (also the current Obama attitude).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military blows against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme failed.
"If I am elected, I command Iran to stop," he had spoken.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel increased military aid and charged Obama to remain guilty of this partner's obligations.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, has a disgraceful document opinion on his part.
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat to counter, since Beijing's attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to pay more attention to the fact that China had been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
On the other hand, the Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military blows against Iran, is willing to engage the American army against drug cartels in Mexico.
The attack on torture against suspected terrorists by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a weight of extra-political importance.
The current Presidential Contractors opposed the fact that Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all of this, won the Cold War.
They recalled that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which involved anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive discord with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boy" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
However, this indifference is not quite so coercive.
The population rather estimates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, she has been guarding herself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America had to be rebuilt economically in order to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic seabed and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to perform this event with brilliance and Gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, have attended the opening of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly to the sea level on the Baltic Sea coast during the last Tuesday under orchestral sound and at fine taste buffet.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically combined the valve's load, which carries the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first 1224 km long pipeline linking the region of Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the possibility of building a third line on your own track begin.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land roads.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: it is now more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest in the debate, was not shy away from comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Swiss Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically more sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of a deforestation of European energy, as the project has struck a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has managed to achieve its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are going to decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing to the degree to which the large gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom Managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete lining to protect it from anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m deep.
During her construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be balanced.
"A hundred or so mines had to be removed or destroyed cautiously," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off Sweden's coast, but project managers have taken a step away, as Sweden was not keen to see a Russian state company settle on its shores in a permanent manner.
"In the case of a disaster, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller explained.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the constructors, since the tails were estimated to have a leak resistance per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot controlled by a seaship for external surveillance purposes and by an apparatus circulating within the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measuring one metre in diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of the line movement at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the least repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E.ON and BASF (each 15,5%), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French group GDF Suez (one to 9%) are affiliated here.
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has thus rented the entire capacity of its gas transport to the renewable 20th-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transporter gas volume fails," Jens Müller explained.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For example, for GDF Suez, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are committed to recovering their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline enters a sandy coastal line with pine wooded pines at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlet pumps.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark notebook.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight given by writing hours.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular ribbon, rubber band, egg-shell sides, as over time.
The Moleskin Notebook, as is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at the time to bring a distraught design notebook to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, at the time specialist consultant of the company, is responsible for the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (mole skin), which refers to a cotton varnish that is used, for example, for coverings of upholstery benches.
This kind of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Zebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established by a sales volume of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of buyers, as the notebook delights businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which initially numbered 12 employees, currently employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small shops of the city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and his new need for writing, which exists despite the upsurge of e-mails," said Maria Zebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)", in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, the company also brought a tape with leopard patterns to the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of time and understood to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer shells... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that brings Neider to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate at such a high level for disabled workers?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for disabled people".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in the disabled is always twice as high as the average average: 19%, compared to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, emphasizes the "week of work for the disabled".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done."
However, it has to be said that many obstacles remain for disabled people before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have an Abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with a higher level of education.
Finally, longterm unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for disabled people compared with 38% for the whole.
In short, there are so many criteria which make it difficult to re-enter work and which form the core of the problem," said Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
Keeps the unspoken, the mental attitudes, which, while certain, but slowly evolve.
A study conducted in April by the Association IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers in question have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people", which "overrepresented" is "of persons in wheelchairs, mental or intellectually impaired persons".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go in order to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now up to 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
Evidence: The number of "payable" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid in between 2007 and 2011, i.e. from 59.000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also brings real recognition, particularly in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments employ disabled persons between 20 and 49 people, while enterprises with between 100 and 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard:"What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45) the forehead, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasure that brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far taken to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been happy to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, its progress and the fact that it is Belgium".
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures him.
As to the contrast between his presentation in Club and National Elf"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille, I am all year long, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to get started."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France in order to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "rejoicing".
Since the age of seven, the French national team has fired him, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to the strengthening of the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just crossed the road."
"To be allowed to play means great luck!"
Leekens, on his part, let the sound of "stolz" with kindness.
"The Pride of a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "nigh children" - that France "has once again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done damn good work," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees himself very well sharing the aircraft with the Blue (French national elf) ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the return game against Bosnia (22.00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the playoff two teams had missed the point of fact.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest flight of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the hint (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the party for more than an hour, but the team was unable to press the thing down the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk, because we have not achieved a forward door".
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are going to beat themselves in front of an audience as hot as the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close," said optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
The decision on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
A decision can already suffice for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk, because we have not achieved a forward gate," regrets Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had already at first put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "give no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is actually implemented this time.
