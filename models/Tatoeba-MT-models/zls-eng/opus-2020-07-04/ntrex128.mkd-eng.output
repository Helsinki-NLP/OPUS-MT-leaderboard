Members of the Wells National Assembly worry that they are “seeing like maps ”
Some members of the congregation are amazed at the proposal to change their name to MWP.
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welles Parliament.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may be the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his party is concerned that it "composes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Velkish, twp means "crazy/crazy", and pwp means "how".
A member of Plaid said the party was completely "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party's works were "free" to change the name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "matet" (ang. Muppet) is large.
In this context, the Velka letter "w" is spoken in a similar way to the Irish-English excuse of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce the name changes, said, "The final decision on any words to appoint members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Law on Wells’ Government of 2017 gave the Wells Congregation the power to change his name.
In June, the commission announced the results of consultations with the public on proposals suggesting a major support for the appointment of the assembly as the Wells Parliament.
On the issue of the name of members of the assembly, the commission prefers members of the Velenian Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from public consultation.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus may cause headaches for Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give their final vote on the issue of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "The Northern Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was put in a bid to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to exercise its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the lobby for a change of name, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell quieted as the Churches in Harlem face problems
"It's historic, the old people I talked to say that every corner there was a bar and a church," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither."
He said disappearing bars is understandable.
"People socialise in another way today," he said.
"The searches are no longer the daily rooms of the settlements where people regularly go."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started."
Churches, he added, can be replaced by housing buildings full of people who will not help the rest of the settlement.
"The majority of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and this will speed up the day when these churches are completely closed because it is unlikely that most of the people moving into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregations of the whites before Harlem became the metropolis of the blacks – a metropolis in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original integration of the White Methodists moved away in the 30s.
The convention of black people who exercise their faith nearby takes possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken by the congregation of black people during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the sellers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was very damaged in a fire in 1939, but since members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly referred to the carillon as “the bell of the poor. ”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it different: "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carilon in the world to play black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwinder said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in St Martin in the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, a part brought by the unprofessional leaders of the church, and a part of the Episcopia.
The church board – the church's governing body, composed of non-professional leaders -- wrote to the parish in July with concern that the parish "will require the transfer of expenses" to the church board, although the church board was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the eparchy.
Shark hurt a 13-year-old on a lobster dive in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamell told the television KSWB in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel declared that he first thought it was a thrill to catch a lobster, but then “he realized that he was yelling, ‘ He bit me!
He bit me!”
He saw the whole key bone," Hamel said he noticed after he reached the boy.
"I called everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!" Hamel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter at the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, taken as critical.
It is not known what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach savior, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark in the area had previously been spotted several weeks ago, but decided that shark was not of a dangerous nature.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the top of the tornado.
Authorised authorities have closed the beach off the Ponto beach in Kasablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans invade the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Super Other and Debenhams with rafts of beauty in the style of stockhouses full of professional assistants.
As part of a significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom that weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, large beauty shelfes will be tested in 11 stores everywhere in the country, and will be represented in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The beauty investment appeared after supermarkets began to look for ways to use the space of shelfes that once was intended for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said they would double the offer of beauty funds for the first time up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also starting its Boutique makeup series again, so most products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required of younger consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfumer will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first one opened in Craydon, southern London, last week, and the second opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food on a daily basis in local shops means that supermarkets should do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, the director of Sainsbury's, said that shops will increasingly look like stockhouses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight against disconts Aldi and Lidl with more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos' stores into hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased the sale of supplies and made purchases more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganise its beauty and pharmacy departments has ended.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreement over the way profits are shared from chemical goods stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celiso, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and sense of our beauty shelf to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to fit every need, and the attractive environment and suitable locations mean that we are now a mandatory beauty destination that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "Anger" since Holly Wiloughby pulled out of a 11 million-pound deal.
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den has gone "backward" after TV leader Holly Vilobi withdrew from a 11 million-pound contract with his branded life-style business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Villaby doesn't have time for their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
The couple's business is linked to the Gwynnet Paltrow brand.
This 37-year-old head of the morning program told Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Viloby left Peter Jones, the Dragons Den star, withdrawing from their profitable branded business for life-style at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "noise" when a TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Bukinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean she no longer has the time to devote herself to their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
The business is linked to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand and has been said to double the Willoughby wealth of the estimated 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Villaby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones rushed from Britain to one of his weekends.
One source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-lasting future that she would have sent over the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely unsuitable.
No one could believe what was happening Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this guide to the morning program, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in pillows and candlelight products, to clothing and household products and to the potential for further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Viloby, a mother of three, and husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kappa, for ten years.
Vilobi founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Vilobi should become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity (I'm a star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We do not comment on his business ventures".
A serious talk “and then we fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the media to comment on what some would consider "unpresidential" and because it is so positive for North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his voice disguised as a "prosecutor of news".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the decalisation of North Korea.
But decalarisation negotiations have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "adequate response" from the United States to the early moves of North Korea for disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
"We agree perfectly with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people were going to die.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results -- completed rocket samples, helped release hostages, and the remaining US soldiers have returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we will have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island and took hundreds of lives
The consequences of the Lombok earthquake, for example, were told by foreign NGOs that they did not need it.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was distributed, no elementary disaster was declared, a precondition for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, which is why it is a challenge," said Mr. Sembang.
Although Save the Children, a team that travels to Palu is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to operate on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if they will be allowed to contribute to help efforts by international agencies.
Because of the ever - hit earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains desperate for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters in Aceh were built, they are not common sights in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a tsunami cheese in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best of times, traveling across many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign included improving Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-elections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows, and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Stardge from Liverpool Team equates against Chelsea
Daniel Stardge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League at 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Stardge to about 30 yards from Chelsea' goal, while his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball from the left before he headed it to the distant station.
The ball was moving high above the 16th as it turned toward the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went through the jumped Kep Arizabababaa and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible," Staraj told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante getting closer and I just touched her and didn't think much about it and I was just shooting."
Chelsea led 1-0 to a half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored the goal at 25 minutes.
The swimmer submitted a fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack before hitting the ball almost to half the ground, and then sprinted into the half of Liverpool.
They quickly introduced themselves to Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then set off a missile, leading Hasard into the 16th.
Hazard spent his defenses finishing up the network of a distant left foot strike by Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples in the group phase of the League of Champions in 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA League of Europe at 3:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquake victims and the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's crash agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into a 7.5-mile earthquake that hit Friday and caused 20-foot waves, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 38,000 inhabitants, was poisoned by a shot of the broken buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation into murder was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mersaid.
Forty-four years old women were found at 7.55 with puncture wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area who saw or heard anything to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Oagen said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesman that the woman whose body was found to be a local resident of Birkenhead and found in an object.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and as the police have said, they will inform the victim’s loved ones.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Moves has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no entry or exit of the building is allowed.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that they will pass hours before they can return.
Someone heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared at the scene.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was out.
A number of police officers stood in the cordon and watched the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact anonymous crime fighters at 0800 555 111 quoting a 247 text of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament became the latest memory blow in the dispute for "the copying of history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "crazy" and "inquisition to copy history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “In the present debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure would become a target.
The iconoclastic of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the works of his ancestral, Thomas, in the previous century.
The beautiful presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Torneycroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiany of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many think, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate play is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid - 17th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identifying figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A killer pig broke up and killed a Chinese farmer.
Pigs attacked and killed a market farmer in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only after the name "Juan", was found dead with a severe artery dressed in blood near a dead end of the Lyupanschui market in the province of Gicou, South China, Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pig farm pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Kinghai, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Juan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pig's shit.
He declared that he was a great boar of blood on his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that a bucket of 550 pounds ripped the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's foot was bloody and broken," said the cousin, given by the name "Wu", according to a quote in the evening news of Guwian.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40pm Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police were collecting evidence at the site.
Yuan's family and market members reportedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that have attacked humans have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a wife and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 650 pounds pierced a Velk farmer to his tractor until his wife evicted the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to southwest United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods of rain in northern Mexico and southwest United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought 85mph winds, category 1 hurricane from 5:00 East on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to emerge and is moving eastward to the western coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to inject large tropical moisture north into the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to ten inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the closer depression will create abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sharp floods, ruins, and possible landslides in the desert.
The large tropical moisture will cause rainfall that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is particularly recommended not to go to the desert in the possibility of tropical rain.
Desperate rain can cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The closer depression will bring local rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch may be possible, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region from their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads more late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will expand to "four corners" on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected all over the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical areas remain high.
At times, this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will occur in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There's almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the superstitious.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates the possibility of an average temperature for the eastern parts of the United States, until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony Thursday by the nominated Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 80s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the unprecedented political situation continued, with speakers who interrupted the latest Friday-minute changeover programmes: Jeff Flake, a Arizona senator, made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's trial committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh had delivered her a piano and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100 per cent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, saw it Friday.
The company had an average view of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who are looking at offices.
To show it better, it's an audience of the size of a playoffs in football or film academy awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led to all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Blake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office announced that he would vote for Kavano, CNN and CBS cameras caught him protestors shouting at him Friday morning while he was trying to get into the elevator for the hearing of the judicial committee.
He stood with depressed eyes for a few minutes as he was reproved, and all was transmitted live to CNN.
"They stand here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth"?
He was told, "you have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, that he would have more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee should have voted to advance Kavano's nomination in the Senate for voting.
But Flake said he would do so only if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the accusations against the nominated one next week, which was requested by the minority Democrats.
Flack was convinced in part by the conversation with his friend, democratic senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and with several senators afterwards, Flack made a decision.
Flickr's election had great significance, as it was obvious Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "playing politics" on the coastline
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to that on the newspaper's main page, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Chakers" plan for Braggzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the mutual costs was "fully absurd".
The shooting at Wade Simms: police arrest suspect Ditheon Simson for the death of sportsman at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Simms' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
The twenty-year-old Ditheon Simpson has been arrested and detained in custody on second degree murder charges, Baton Rouge's police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, a CBS's WAFB partner said.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The M.E.'s office of the parish of eastern Baton Rouge released a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head towards the neck.
The department thanks the refugee unit for Louisiana state police, the state police crime lab, the police at South University and citizens of the area for the assistance they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The Athens Director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for its "activity in search of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
A 6.6-foot Beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 captured balls by play in the last season.
On Friday morning, basketball team coach at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destructive" and "in shock" from Simms' death.
"This is what you care about without stopping," the coach said.
Wolfen cast ashes on Mexico City
Exhausting ash from the Popocapetel volcano reached the southern settlements of Mexico’s capital.
The national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go towards the volcano after a crater activity began and 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered for 24 hours.
The centre was followed by a number of tattoos and tremors.
Photos of social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysics noticed an increased activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters clashed with police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote for secession.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later in the day, fights broke out, and police used their toes to beat the fights.
For more than a few hours, independence groups shouted, "There is no forgetting, there is no forgiveness," and union protesters shouted, "Long Long to Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in the protests, local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterised the October 1st referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalonians.
The majority voted for independence, though the outcome was small due to a boycott by people who oppose the secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations of national police support.
The demonstration was held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician, Narcis Termes, who took part in the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hopes Catalonia has a chance to gain independence.
"For the past year we have been through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they won a vital but close victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders or in a self-elected persecution or in detention pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, recording a protest to support police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting harder and harder," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail before trial since last year, announced that he will run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after resuming a car at a house in Londonberry.
The incident took place in Balinagard Cresent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said there was damage to the gate and the building itself.
At one point, it could be fired with an arrow from a crossbow to a car.
Menga's score brings Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga to Livingston provides victory
The advanced Livingston performed the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved significant as Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernian to second position.
Gerard's country remains without a victory in this season's championship and will face leaders Harts next week, leaving eight points behind.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe's League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division during six matches, and coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against cruel guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before giving the goal, and their directness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through, but dragged the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgo could only point his efforts far after he played the blow with Craig Halquet's head over his goal.
Guests gladly let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems with the stocks they set.
And that is exactly how the crucial goal came.
The Rangers missed a free blow, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together set up Menga, who only touched gave a goal from the center of the 16th.
Until now, the Rangers dominated possessions of the ball, but could not break through the defense of the hosts, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't play for the most part.
That scheme continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morlos performed a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unable to score a goal because of the skill of Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgo took the ball away from another laid-off move to Livingston.
Livingston's 16-year-old passed by and was repeatedly defended, while two demands for a pen -- after Halquet's contest on Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for handplay -- were rejected.
Livingston's "Fenomenal" Analysis
Alasder Lamunt of BBC Scotland in the Tony Makarini arena
Phenomenal game and score for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to surpass the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt about the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halquet was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still held Connor Goldson and Joe Waral on standby.
The Rangers still praised inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerard's leadership, they are now lagging behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once managed to open the hosts – and it was a small awareness of the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Colony
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at correcting the relations between NATO neighbours.
They deteriorated because of problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population.
Police quoted security reasons as preventing a group of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds also pleaded, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protesters reflect the division of the visitor celebrated as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat of others.
Traffic crash on the way to Deptford: cyclist dies in a car crash
A biker died after a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn, a large traffic ticket in Deptford, in the southeast part of the city in about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there was an ambulance, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months after the death of another cyclist in a traffic accident on the Cylders Street where the driver fled, about a mile from Saturday’s clash.
Metro police said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Blocks on the road and buses are rerouted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Latin Prison: Six Policemen in Disarray · Global Voices
Six prison police officers are injured in riots in a men's high-level security prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Vorsceshire at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and still persist.
The Tornado unit's specialists were brought to resolve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Cops were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
The prison spokesman said: "Secretally trained prison staff were directed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Latin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Latin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
It was announced in June that the governor of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, police for public order and peace were called to prison to deal with serious riots in which staff was attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sharp flooding (can be useful to dry areas)
A tropical depression may rarely occur to hit Arizona, but that is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining force will pass across the desert southwest region, risking a sharp flood.
The State Meteorological Station has already issued warnings of a possible sharp flood for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, down to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Soyt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel along a direct path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The State Meteorological Station in Phoenix reported that only “ten tropical cyclones kept tropical storm status or depression within a range of 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane in an range of 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the del Mongolon of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rockies Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas of sharp flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the US Dry Tracking Body, nearly 40 per cent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," the weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s path led to soil rubble all over Mexico’s Lower California peninsula.
Rosa, still radiant on Sunday morning with peak winds of 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold water in the Pacific and is dropping.
Rains are therefore expected in Mexico with the height of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico may be intense and present significant flood risks.
"A rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora is expected, with a maximum of 10 inches of rain," the weather.com said.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in the early hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains are the heavy rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States," the State Centre for Hurricane said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and ruins streams, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Attack at Midsamer Norton: Four Arrested for Murders · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old found stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Exelzior Terrace's area of Midsamer Norton about 4,00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital and is in a "stable" state.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police from Avon and Somerset said.
The police asked if someone had the surveillance footage on the cell phone from the scene, to step up.
Trump said that Kavano "has endured the greatest wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The voice of Judge Kavano is a voice for rejecting the Democratic Party's most cruel and scandalous tactics," Trump said at a gathering in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavano "has endured the greatest wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blacie Ford that he committed a sex attack on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing for her accusations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president spoke directly of Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the significance of Republican turnout in early elections.
"It's five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I don't run, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "resist and prevent".
The first key vote on Kavano's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, GOP's senior leader told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunamis, while the total number of deaths increases
At least 384 people were killed, many were taken from huge waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesian island Sulavesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves measuring six feet (18 m) hit the shore of sunset, treating many to a certain death and destroying everything on their path.
After the 7.5-square earthquake, it hit tsunamis.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people still did their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson for the BNPB agency to mediate Indonesia in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea with speeds of 800 km/h (497 km/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air images released by the crash agency have shown many destroyed buildings and shops, bent bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
The successive tremors continued to shake the coastal town on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were found in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's (BPPT) technology assessment and application agency said that energy released from a massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than energy released from an atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, may enhance the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "moving" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the shot of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be increased along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in the announcement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised Saturday for not telling us that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about at the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared by social media, a man of the upper floors of a building shouts insanely, warning people on the street down about the tsunami approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water stabs itself on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not confirm the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a power failure that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been re-opened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo had a plan to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia rose above 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision personnel from Dongala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees sheltered in ceremonial shelters in the courtyard of their office, they traveled by road through scenes in the wilderness, Mr. Dosebba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's too bad.
Even as the relief groups began their dark efforts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign relief experts were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'all right, this is a national disaster', we can get international assistance, but there is no status yet."
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be wonders to ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who had been pinned under her kick for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subbandono, coach of Indonesia's state paraglidership team, trained two of the missing paragliderists for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandaghi added, were his students.
"As a senator in the field of parallelism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, when he began to circulate news of the collapse of Hotel Roa Roa in the paragliderist community, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to the contestants from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray sign of stuttering, rather than a son.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when they filled a ATM at the "Newport of the Whale"
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who complemented a ATM at a "Newsport on the Whale", according to a press release at Newport Police Station.
The car driver celebrated the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "run from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to a statement, but police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kane West: Raper Changes His Name in JY · Global Voices
The Kanye West rapper changed his name to Yay.
The change was announced on Saturday by Twitter, he wrote: "The substance previously known as the Kajnje West."
Forty-one-year-old West wore the nickname Jay for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on a show that had to decline "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as a shortcut to his currently professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious significance for him.
"I think 'Yay' is the most widely used word in the Bible and it means 'You'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with Radio Manager Big Boy.
"What it means to me is you, I'm us, it's us.
He moved from Kenya, meaning the only one, to only Yei, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, all.
The album is more a show of who we are."
He is one of the many known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Dedi, P. Dedi or Dedi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love Love and Love.
A former West Associate, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without a drawing and all the big letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the military on civilians
Mexico Vice President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelko Plaza that "he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
The military fired peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time when left-wing student movements rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the young Mexicans by giving monthly help to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
US needs to double financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, so the United States should double the research funds in the field, said the investor and practitioner to AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number 1 in innovations for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
The doubling of the funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area would make the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was issued this month by Hoaughton Miscurt, is the general director of Synovation Ventures, which invest in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melon University he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranking American suit player, and later served as director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Li thanked for previous competitions on US government technology as the challenge in robotics of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when the next match will be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States should often work hard to obtain state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that took the academic leaders, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Leigh said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should automatically be offered to doctors of science for artificial intelligence," he said.
China's National Council issued its Plan for Development of Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions like the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government organisations are giving money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of the work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Ministry established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should cover partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of an authorised Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called "AI Next".
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100m a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US legislation requiring the creation of a National Commission for Security of artificial intelligence has been unacted for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to "Northern Macedonia" a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requirements for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues its northern neighbour's name is the right to exercise its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign raised doubts as to whether the output would meet the minimum 50 per cent necessary for the referendum to enter into force.
The issue on the referendum tab read "Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece".
Supporters of a change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after Yugoslavia's breakup.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Djorgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported until 13.00.
However, the turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their votes in Macedonia's referendum on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents placed by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go in with our heads raised high, not from the back entry," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but still have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be a "confirm for our future".
The poll, released last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required outcome.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, output should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since they came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City spent all his defenses on Brighton for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were quick to overcome Brighton's defense in a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Ethiopian Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker was given mid-field in the beginning of the sequence.
It quickly passed between the three Bryton defence players before entering the open ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four “greens. ”
He walked around one defensive player before he ran a few others on the edge of Brighton's 16-year-old.
He then passed the left of it to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to return Aguero's ball, which with his right leg beat Brighton's goalie Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right side of the network.
"Aguero has foot problems," City Manager Pep Gwardiola told reporters.
"We talked to play 55 – 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave us a goal at that moment."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blue" gave Stirling the fight for Prime Minister the League.
The goal came in at 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a couple of times before he took Sterling to a distant spot.
The attack on the "heavenly blue" brought the ball into the net before it got into the out.
City will fight Hofenheim in competition with the League of Champions Group in 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Nakar arena, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play a team player against Rockys.
As Nashnels was eliminated from the playoff battle, there was no reason to push another start.
But always the competitive Sherzer hopes to stop in the central square Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the playoffs for the Rockies team, which lead with a match in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rokis' team had at least a Joker for a 5-2 win over Nashnels Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can throw out knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nesnels still needs to announce a starter for Sunday, but they are allegedly inclined to allow Scherzer to throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who starts 34th time, trained to throw on Thursday and throw a regular vacation Sunday.
Washington's right-hand side is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 Strykaut ponies in 220 2/3 injections this season.
Mitinzi for Trump in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation about his election of Brett Kavano to the Supreme Court as he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
"All we have done so far will be put on the line in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big ones – I don't run, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, horrible democrat groups, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, you see wickedness, indifference.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and prevent".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling democrats "frightful, evil, dishonest and untruth".
He mentioned Senator Diana Finstein in the ranks of Democrats set up by the Senate Court Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted by shouting infamy.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, what?
No, no, no, wait a minute - it was a very bad speech of the body - the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Laborists no longer accept different opinions.
Those Who Express Their Opinion Do Not Be tolerated
When moment activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in the order of members of parliament from the Laborist party to whom we are told that we are not welcome – just because it expresses its opinion.
My colleague-parliamentary Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
To the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of a meeting of the East Labour Party of Nottingham stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party's parliament, council meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "mild, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if it really has ever begun.
It is increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, each opinion being judged whether they are acceptable to party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when I thought that we had shared a similar political opinion earlier, they had begun to expect me to change my mind completely and to take attitudes that I would never take, whether it was national security or the EU's internal guard.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical mistreatment of social media calling for condemnation, denial of the policies of the centre, telling me that I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed towards me are usually political.
I have a great fear of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face a number of sexist or racist harassment every day, but they never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age in politics is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every requirement to "no trust" or change the rules for selection, the party becomes narrower opinions.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not so loud, and then "all will be fine".
But that's not the reason I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Laborist Party as a student, provoked by the carelessness of the Tacher government that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who were most needed, whether as a local adviser or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last elections.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes to Braggzit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But I have a message that is not about Nottingham Momum, but about my constituents, whether they are members of the Laborist Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemning threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeated Aar goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Aar earned the triumph in this beautifully fun competition on the day of the Scottish Championship in football.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, which have taken the home team, and Coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested through our matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Aar’s praise, they have taken advantage of their chances. ”
Grant Anderson's point at 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave him the advantage of Ear, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given to the game of Voriors, enabled Melrose to improve numbers, and Jason Baghet grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo delayed Ear’s lead with a pen, earlier, at halftime, he scored a point, and then converted a solo point to 17-5 for Aar during rescue.
But Melrose well began the second half, and Patrick Andreson's point, converted by Bagheg, reduced the leadership to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, which was carried on, and from the beginning, Aar continued to struggle with Staford Macdoval's point, converted by Klimo.
Ear's V-capital, Blair McFerson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged an additional man with an unconverted point on Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team came back and when Struan Hutchson got a yellow card to bring down the Clemo without the ball, McFerson won a touchduan from the foam line on the back side of Aar's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Roe took David Armstrong's blow and sent the wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
Still Game Star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move to the hospitality industry after it was discovered to be named director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series, where he is a writer and together he acts with a long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
The Dooto announced that the next ninth season would be the last and it appears that Kiernan is planning his life after Kreglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The Sea is Ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a hidden-false Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are poured out with the motto: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It's our duty to return."
Through the land of Bolivia, Chile’s memory of the coast lost in a blood conflict for resources in the 19th century is still fresh, such as the longing to sail again after the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the greatest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the international court on October 1st after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and tranquility and of course expected a positive outcome," said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision taken by the international court on large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to Bolivia's sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also depends quite well on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to judge in behalf of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favour.
The UN-based body in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chile's territory and stated it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
That the verdict of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments suggest that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have vanquished Bolivia's cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales's warrior rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that making a court decision is unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, another of Latin American’s most popular presidents, used the problem of the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to keep their promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Rhea says it is a "performance" to consider the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to the declarative completion of the Korean war to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing with the Pyongian declaration to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
Paris fashion reviews reveal the latest line of massive hats on its way to the biggest stores nearby.
If you want to improve the size of your drop collection or completely block the sun, then do not look further.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy excessive hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on Fashion Week in Paris.
Ultimately impractical hats raised Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their designs that fell in the eye after the track.
The piece that came out of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide range of feathers that flooded the model’s head.
The other major accessories included watermelons with zircones, a magic hat, and even pineapples, but they're not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled the diving equipment completely with glasses and a diving tube, and another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style trackers predict that huge hats can come to the shops nearby.
The large hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", a golden hat with a wide range of two feet that brings everyone from Rijana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind too impractical a hat spread across social media sent another big creation along the runway, a straw bag for the beach size almost equal to the height of the model it was dragging.
A dark orange raffle bag, with a raffle board and a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus on Fashion Week in Paris.
Known Stylishman Luc Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in shops next summer, because the designer has caused such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore demand for over-additions."
John Edward: Language skills required for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of remarkable test results, which only strengthens with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best services to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement adapted school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired as an electoral object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in the language he understands, he will do so.
If you talk to him in his language, it'll hit him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on only English when we want to build ties and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages exceed all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher "5+".
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who had also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly gain in the future.
Languages now, as an electoral object, are seen at the same level as STEM-premises ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in independent schools programmes as well as elsewhere.
A survey by the Committee on Employment and Skills of the Ok in 2014 noted that the reasons employers led them to failure to fill jobs were 17 percent due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are needed in the globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give polyglotate priority to competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on more than 4,000 adults from Ok in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to talk, and the French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language training is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of development economies, will equip children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more-class modern languages, while others will be teaching languages that are considered most important in the environment when looking in the future by 2020, like Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be numerous languages from which independent schools, with professors who specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and will arm them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future will bring.
At present, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this needs to be changed in schools.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
‘Il faut bien only faire’ (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will lead Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
Waiting almost ended for fans who wanted to see LeBron James starting for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first game of Sunday's pre-season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it will play, it has not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel wrote a tweet that James would probably play limited time.
After training at the beginning of Sunday, James was asked about his plans for the six matches schedule before Lakers' season.
"I don't need games in the pre-season in this phase of my career to prepare," he said.
Web Channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of rallies as part of the campaign tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies in the coming week, including visits to slopes such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting to confirm his election to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court is at a standstill, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the midst of the mandate, because Republicans may lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's evening rally in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Time zone on the East Coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia via live broadcast on YouTube.
This week, it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of a man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, who has become tense over allegations of bad sexual behavior with the expected delay in the Senate voting up to a week, as long as the FBI investigation is under way.
The primary goal of a series of rallies is to help Republicans win a swing in the November elections.
As a result, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the crowds they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the congress is so important on his agenda that the president will travel in what more federal states with the beginning of the laboring campaign season," a spokesman from Trump's campaign to Reuters, who refused to be named.
Scheduled in the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's rally may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro news.
Saturday is the second trip to Trump in Western Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisay, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrisay that the president must come to improve the popularity of polls," said Simon Hider, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Rider 2018: US team shows courage in fighting to keep their hopes alive at the start of individual Sunday competitions
After three one-sided seasons, the four of us on Saturday afternoon might have been exactly what it needed for the Ryder Cup.
The reversibility of happiness is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all, in such competitions.
Who would say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're having a little bit of luck," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, of four points of leadership and twelve more games.
The Americans according to Spit feel that they have a weak wind in the sails even though they have a sufficient incentive, if nothing else is the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day long and each scored three points of four.
Spit was great and leads with an example.
Those strong outcries of celebrations were becoming stronger during his game , with a key blow that led to an even four-four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His blow at the 15th was welcomed by a similar shout, one that tells you that he believes that the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to get deep and worry about your match," Spit said.
That's all every player has left now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with multiple points from Spit and Thomas in the last two days are France's Molinari and Tommy Flatwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe is four of four and cannot sin.
Mollwood was the only couple with no bad shots on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad shots on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way they seem to run their energy to and from this lush group has assured that they are players that will win Sunday and that there will be no other popular players to ensure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nasional, except for Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both are preferred in different holes at the same time.
However, talks on European fame remain unwarranted.
Bubba Watson and Web Simson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he merged with Alex Noren.
A failed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swedish man in a hole they never got out of.
Sunday, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to watch closely because of interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they do not listen to, and the way strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved considerable leadership on the last day, but the four season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's leadership in double pairs and fours of 10-6 in front of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and France's Molinari led the attack with two wins as Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far on Le Golf Nasional at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy he lost in Haseltin two years ago, dominated the US team that had a lot of failures in the morning double couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans gave more resistance to the fours, winning two matches, but they couldn't get the lead.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points of 12 individual Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second couple in general who won four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After they "sucked" Woods and Patrick Reed in double couples, they played great and beat the spent Woods and US beginner Bryson Deshambu with an even more pronounced score of 5 & 4.
Woods, who got through two swords Saturday, played greatly, but now lost 19 out of 29 doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning double couples, returned as Henry Stanson's partner to the 2-1 fours with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cop - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all after their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set up a two-point measure for Americans Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rachm and Ian Pulter in double pairs and returned later to beat Pulter and Rory McLroy with 4 & 3 in fours, but lost the initial, two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cup Rider a certain team has recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, though as holders of the title, Furic's team had an equal result enough to keep the trophy.
After being the second two days, however, the weekly attack seems to have remained above them.
North Korea says "no chance" to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extended sanctions deepen distrust in the United States and there is no way the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" in last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, disarming nuclear tests, and binding itself against proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's known complaints of Washington's resistance to nuclear disarmament accession "in phases", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyong was doing in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed himself to working towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea is demanding the formal end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to back down in strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament above all" and raises the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal with coercion and even opposes "the end-war declaration," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel on our knees is a vain dream for people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ree did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding, "If the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have ended in such a deadlock."
However, Ri's speech tone was significantly different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles towards the US land is inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "Rather" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year with "complete destruction" of North Korea, much after commending Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said that there remains much to do and sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for it, saying "Does it take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter?"
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, however, that "the Security Council's sanctions must continue completely and without exceptions until it is fully confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only hours later because of a "ganster request".
North Korea committed itself to meeting with Moon this month for disarmament of a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "adequate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalisation of relations with Washington
Harvard Students Visit Training Courses to Get Enough Rest
A new Harvard University course this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing macho culture of learning by staying awake all night using caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing about basic care.
Charles Chaysler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School's dream and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after holding a talk about the impact of inadequate sleep on learning.
"A girl came at the end of the lecture and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help in academic and athletic results, and they improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university said the university had decided to introduce the course after they discovered that students had a serious lack of sleep during Sunday.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student home where students press on coffee glasses, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how inadequate sleep affects athletic results and the importance of the routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn about how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then urges participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chaizler.
The "work all-night work" culture still exists, he said, and more modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to get into hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chayzler recommended that students consider setting an alarm on when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "Blue light" broadcast from electronic screens and the LED light, which moves the circular rhythm, leading to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Manga Goal Destroys Gerard's People · Global Voices
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's blow sent Steven Gerard's straight-up team to Livingston.
The Aybrox team wanted to register its first victory after the February 4-1 triumph at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team delivered the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team eight points behind the blocked-run Harts team in the Scottish first league.
Menga pointed out seven minutes before the halftime, and Rainers' position lost his inspiration and chance to level.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingstone has gone up third and are behind Hibernan according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for the Rangers after liner Judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for head injury after being obviously hit with a distance object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that Aer spent in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 on Livingston who won a score with Harts last week and would have been happy the way his well-trained posture was suffocating his opponents at any chance.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to get a point, two minutes after the start when the Menga's first playoff drove Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle row player missed his chance.
Then a blow from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halcket, but his defence partner Alan Litgou could only play open in defence.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed to have more hope than faith in their last third game.
Alfredo Morlos certainly felt that he should receive a pen in the 15th minute he and Steven Lawles clashed, but Judge Steven Thompson did not give a sign of approval to the Colombian complaint.
Rangers managed to reach only two shots to the goal in the first half, but the former Irons' goalie of Aybrox Liam Kelly did not get tired of the blow to Lassana Coulibali's head and Oviedia's weak blow.
Although the beginning of Livingston's 34th minute may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they earned according to their game.
Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' stroke.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who, with a cold head, chose Menga as a simple ending.
Gerrard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick effect when the wing player passed Morlos, but impressive Kelly reacted from his blockage line.
But Livingston was able to attract guest players to play a game they enjoy, with Litgou and Hackett catching many long additions.
Holt's team was able to expand the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor was well placed and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head on the Korner.
Reingers' replacement, Glenn Middleton had another penalty request after he clashed with Jackobs, but Thompson didn't approve again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now one side of our almanac "on Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and WE LEAR... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hance" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, it has become a major stronghold of science, the Geiger counter has become the main stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "The Colorado Wall", in which they appear to be seemingly inconvincible, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that again? ”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release the radioactivity into the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's probably jumping now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name and onward exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the removed cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the frozen cells and kill them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells as part of treatment
Method includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration to a laboratory
You can “see” protein honor in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the organism.
The test vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the frozen cells, ovarium cancer disappeared within 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their alteration in the laboratory, so that they can "see" protein honour in many types of cancer called HER2 and then return to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute of Betazda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "encouraging the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarium, lungs, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
Similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and their “study” as to target cancer cells is functioning in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Tramp drop, carrying a drop of his motto, after a live Saturday night performance.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was recorded in the studio during a live show Saturday night, after a useless performance praising US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the performance of the third song that night, called the City of Spirits, which carried a drop with a inscription to make America Slavna again, he began to criticise the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
Saturday night, a live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal board on charges of sexual assault on Christine Blake Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's record was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult to go behind the stage because of its drop.
"Beyond the stage, I was mocked.
They said, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in a sink, he said, according to Washington Egzeminer.
News continued: "You want to see the sinking place?" he said you would "put your superman-cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?
"Try with love."
His comments attracted crowd frustrations at least twice, and the team on the evening show seemed embarrassed, told Varayeti, one man told the publisher: "The whole studio is not taken away".
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song "I Love It", dressed as Perier's bottle.
West received support from conservative group TPSAD leader Candis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest spirits: I thank you for getting involved in the dance.”
But the host of the show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was its own and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art" which I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now being "formally known as Kane West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, also known as Puff Dedi, Puff, and P Didi.
The rapper colleague, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the late musical legend Prince, has changed his name in symbol, and then the artist from a previously known Prince.
Charge for attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder since he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before a higher court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
The Star of the Thrones, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordman like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series The Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of macho hero when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be firm to be respected.
In a statement about the Sunday Times cultural part, Kit said he believed "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #Now I am telling you.
Kit, who recently married the Game of Thrones, Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has "strong feelings" on this issue.
"Lonily I have strong feelings, at the moment - where have we sinned with manhood?, he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic manhood, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, but what is taught?
What does TV teach, and what on the street make young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time-- how do we change that?
Because it's obvious there's something wrong with young men."
In an interview, he also admitted he would not participate in the extensions of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he "ends fights and horses".
Since November, Kit will be in a rebuilding of the true West of Sam Shepherd, a story about a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that he had met his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played the Games, a character who had a love charm with the image of Keith, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won the Eme Awards.
The couple were married in June 2018 to Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% growth in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 82,000 are covered in the country, health officials say.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new events have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading ramid across parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Juan.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from LGBT communities is high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the spreads of the disease are caused by inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the China government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data from a member of staff related to a Republican party senator as "hazard lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
US Representative Maxine Waters rejected Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had released personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's pages.
The Los Angeles democrat has assured that the claims are of "ultra-right" sympathizers and web sites.
"Lagay, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information reportedly includes a home address and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hec from Utah.
The information appeared on the internet Thursday, published by an unknown face in the Capitol Hill during a hearing panel of the Senate about allegations of sexual misbehavior against Brett Kavano, nominated as Supreme Court Judge.
The information provided appeared shortly after Kavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redgate have announced that the IP address identified by the source of the publication is linked to Waters' office and information has been published as a member of Waters personnel, Hill said.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and are absolute lies," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those untrue and false accusations - in no way is responsible for the information provided.
Unhappy accusations are completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Flasher.
"These denials are nervous," said Flasher.
"This shows that she has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He mustn't wonder about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats related to Judge Kavano, who was accused of critics because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in mid-term elections, has also voted on Twitter.
"If it's true, that's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed "the authorities and the police of false claims.
"We will enable offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all my staff".
The thought of Johnny English Attacking Again - undermined the spy fraud of Rowan Atkinson
Now it's traditional to look for elements of Braggsit in every new movie with a British relationship, and that seems to be true of this restoration of the cheater's franchise, action comedy Johnie English -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Will careful self-crying the subject of how clearly we are insufferably be the new opportunity for exports that the nation has?
In spite of all, the face with big eyes and many facets of incompetent Johnny English was granted a license to "close" things the second time -- his name first of all signifies that he is a comical creation with a broad scope, made for the viewers in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who despite his bizarre efforts to cautious glamour after a little resembles Clouseau, has features of Mr. Bain and a part of the boy who plays a note from the Kochi song of fire since the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
His foundation is the traveling man and the mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barklis's now forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There is one or two moments in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I liked it when Johnny English is getting closer to a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor's wigs hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somehow superficial, especially because "serious" film brands such as 007 and impossible Mission and contain themselves elements of comedy.
Humour seems to be meant for children, instead of adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy troubles aren't as intense and focused as they are the dumb ones on Atkinson's character.
The theme that is being perpetrated all the time is that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyber-Hacker infiltrated a super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, of disappointing an agent on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the final chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combat figure and is already suffering from the total meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives everything in this image of the quezi-Tereza-Me, but there is nothing special about the scenario that would be worked out.
Its intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, it will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling yourself Johnny English who now works as a teacher at a private school, but "on black" gives secret agent classes: there are a few good boys here, when English offers a school of spying that resembles rock academy.
English has quickly been called to Whitehall at an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, regarding a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicki Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all things in the King's Secret Service, go back to action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Boulevata, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technologist who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: wicked Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their Odssey of absurd actions: disguised as waiters they burn a French restaurant; they make a waste after they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht; and English starts right anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and loud as it is, there is quite a children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice, moderate things.
And like with the other Johnny English movies, I can't help but think about it: can't the British film industry play a role for Rowan Atkinson to use his talent?
Laborists deny that they're building a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid in five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work for four days a week -- but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "responses" on the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to be more inclined to workers.
The four-day working week gap is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior member of the party told Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a working week of four days is an aspiration that is in line with the party's accession to rebalance the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Laborist Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated for a four-day working week during the campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party strategy, and the party does not consider such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonal used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonell said he was determined to seize the power of "directors without a face" and "protesters" in the utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make "deductions" for non-ethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans for workers to become part of companies boards and to create funds for inclusive property with 10 per cent of private companies' capital to belong to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is making a statement about 60 Minutes on whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavano has postponed the final vote on his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least a week and is updating the question of whether the Bureau's findings could reconsider any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published Sunday, Scott Pelli's correspondence asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lyndsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I think of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, looks carved into a stone.
"My decision was made on Brett Cavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied energetically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blakey Ford.
"All she named could not confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and did you do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizens festival, an annual musical event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held seven times, and the Global Citizens Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy the appearances of names such as Janet Jackson, Carrie B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they do not want to pay for VIP ticket), participants have to meet a few tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending a message to a world leader, phone call or another useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Golbalen Citizens for remaining 12 years to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert the right way to convince people to ask to do something or just another case of "click-activism" - people who feel that they are making a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have argued that they have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say that these activities have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitment and strategies that have collected more than 37 billion dollars and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements as a result of their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the pools have direct influence on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, Partnership of Investors and Improvators, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children use their potential", which promised to provide $35m for Rwanda to help with food shortages in the country after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from the Global Citizens.
"By supporting the government of Britain, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of Moc of Food told the gathered people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said more than 5,000 activities were taken with calls to improve the diet of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Food, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the often asked questions of their website, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens replied: “It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will not succeed.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who are going to perform this year's event in New York, hosted by Debor-Li Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy to block Russian energy exports - the interior ministry
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky discovered, as Washington Egzeminer quoted him as saying.
According to Xinki, Russia's involvement in Syria -- namely, where it operates following the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a campaign to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of energy shopping, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the sea roads remain open and if necessary by means of a blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed those present at an event organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group representing itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing the fuels," he said, while talking about Russia as a "one awkward pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" Northern Tec2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Moscow's prisoner from Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline worth 11 billion dollars should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance met resistance from Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kemph, the first man of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will consider carefully" whether to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elisabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "be careful to consider" whether to run for president after mid-term elections.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he is considering running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our dysfunctional government, which means a woman on her forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren assessed the work of President Donald Trump during a meeting in the town hall and said he "runs the state in the wrong direction.
"I'm too worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren opened up her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavano.
In a message Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a large number of voters in its election unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of the "probable" voters of Massachusetts said the senator should not be run, according to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Bostonski Globus.
Thirty-two per cent support such candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting potential nomination, and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names of the democratic party discussed in 2020 are former Deputy President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about Trek Paylin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally.
Trek Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying for it in September.
He was arrested and indicted in an incident of domestic violence Monday night
"The news that my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I know how other families that are torn apart because of the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are coming back," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called the arrest "a elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "are returning a little different, they return solid, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their air force buddies have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assault on a female person, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the police in Vasila.
18 federal states, Washington city support contesting new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support contesting a new US policy that prevents asylum from being given to victims who flee from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and Washington City submitted a petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who challenges politics, En-Bi-C News reported.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace against parliament, which the US Civil Liberties Union submitted against federal policy in August, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang", abused her, but US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where asylum claims in the United States originate, as nations with constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy overturns the Board's decision on immigration complaints from 2014, which allowed unaccompanied immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The city's public attorney, Washington-based Carl Rasin, said Friday that the new policy "has failed decades of law-making at federal, federal and international levels".
"Federal law requires that all asylum requirements be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, advocates in the letter argue that a policy that prevents the entry of immigrants is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sesns ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims who flee from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is an asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear over race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sesns said in a policy presentation on 11 June.
Azil was never designed as a solution to all problems -- not even all serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu are being made because the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her male baby at the evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
Residents return to their destroyed homes and choose from their alleged objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has broken back and shoulder, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside for frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came in his eyes when he described a powerful earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife looking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blames China for "minor twitching" with "propagand advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published an ad on four sides in the US daily by listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China's paid addition to Tea Daily in De Moin Registry -- the best-selling newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of meddling in US congress elections on 6 November, China rejected the indictment.
Trump's indictment that Beijing is trying to interfere in US elections marked the US services' association with Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise commercial promotions, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war that equals tariffs for imports to each other.
China's payback tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed at exporters from federal states like Iowa, who support Trump's Republican party, confirmed Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and a former longtime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Registry, "now doubles the harassment with propaganda commercials in our free press".
"In the dissemble of propaganda, the government of China misused the cultured American tradition of free speech and free media by putting ads in De Moin Registry," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not really see the desperate opinions that Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most read newspapers rejected his offer to publish" on the column, though he did not say what newspaper it is.
Republicans drift away from women's votes before mid-term elections, due to a debate with Kavano, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are unheard of or defending Brett Kavano's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially by women in the upcoming mid-term elections.
Emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans already have said they want to continue voting.
From such things there is no turning back," Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, wrote for Hill, in a column published Saturday.
Richer said he doubted that the pressure on the FBI's investigation into Senator Jeff Flake's (The Republican of Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- will not forget tomorrow or November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman of the MoveOn progressive group, said in front of Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "Noemuri is coming!" at a protest in the Senate corridor, when Republicans, who are in control of the legal commission, decided to resume Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blake Ford's testimony, Mik said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are already saying they are high; that is true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent women's voters in suburbs and young voters, aged 18-29, who, while disliked by the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which outlined her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to news by the En-Bis.
"It's not just about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavano will go to the hearing, it's about the way Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities United States, a group that helps choose democrats, about the news channel.
Yet, the Americans are divided about who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh's testimonies, although the majority accept the first memory.
A new Ju-Gov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent declared that they were thinking of Kavanaugh, likely or definitely lying in the testimony, while only 30 percent feel the same way about Ford.
After Flack's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations brought out by Ford, as well as at least one more, of Debor Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified in front of the Senate's legal board, under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses that the Supreme Court judge candidate showed her the genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Network plans to start a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Burners-Li, the inventor of the World Network, begins with a startup business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that was built on the open source platform Solid, at the Berners-Li.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Compani, Berners-Li joked that Ingroup's intention was a "world domination".
"We have to do this now," he said of starting-up business.
"Now is the historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "the Internet Data Tower" or a shortcutd sub-circuit.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Sleak and Snotifay are all available to a viewer at the same time.
What is unique about the Internet's personal data store is that only the user depends on who has access to a particular type of information.
The company calls it "personal enhancement through data".
Inrapt's idea, according to the executive director of John Bruce's company, is to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of the Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with a project deal and a community of adaptors.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrapt web site.
Burners-Li said he and his team are not talking to "Fesbuck and Google about whether to introduce a full change where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
"We are not looking for their permission."
In a press release released on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "the Inrapt mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet by establishing the consortium of the World Technology Network in Massachusetts.
Lately, Burners-Li is an influential speaker in the Internet neutrality debate.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era on the Internet," Burners-Li added.
Bernard Van: A Known Vitorian Crosser of World War I · Global Voices
The only clergyman of the English Church who received a Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honor Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Belenglaz and Lehaukur.
Yet, he was killed by a sniper four days later and had never learned that he had received the highest British military medal.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was a "amazing symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather got the medal.
According to London's Gazeta, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quntin, "It's very thick fog and under strong fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the sites where he shot himself and led ahead with “the greatest courage, ” before attacking the cannon nest himself and crippled three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 -- almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "what I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that makes us modest".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Youth Empire Band.
Michael Van said it "is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by many people".
The fans of the combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead they got Pepa Price.
Imagine, you've been up all night watching Belator 206, and you don't have the chance to watch the main event.
San Jose's list contained 13 fights, including six of the main card shown live all night in Channel 5 Britain.
At 6 a.m., only Gerard Mousssi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face up, UK viewers remained appalled when the channel moved to Pepa Price.
Some were not impressed after they stayed awake until early hours for the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the transfer of child-like cartoon filter as "some sick joke".
"The law is such that at 6 am it was inappropriate, so it had to be transferred to a children's programme," Dave Schwarz, the vice president of Belator for Marketing and Communication, said when asked about the transfer.
"Pep Pig," yeah.
The company's President Belator Scott Cooker said they would work on a schedule that would include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about re-entry, I think we can probably find a solution," Kuker said.
"But there's six o'clock Sunday morning and we won't be able to find a solution Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, we received a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were favorably.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, rather than six as we normally do -- we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we overdid it.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discounts on a desert island: Tom Daley felt "inferior" over sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone for his sexuality -- but it motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't get it until he went to high school that "they're not all like me"
Speaking of the first show Discovi on a desert island on Radio 4, presented by Laurent Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hop" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular speaker of the longtime show Kirsty Young took months off because of a disease.
Turning up as a comparative figure in Lavern's first programme, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathies towards boys and girls".
He said: “By this day, these feelings of low value and diversity were the things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two bronze medal Olympic has become a prominent LGBT campaigner and has used its performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "I'm surprised".
Daley married the Oscar, who is 20 years old last year, but said the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you pass through so much at an early age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it is hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son called Robert Ray Black-Day, and Daley said that "all his views" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London 2012 -- because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be here to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daily competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I dreamed about all my life -- to jump in front of a home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride by Heather Smol - who was turning into his head when he was preparing for the Olympics and was still in the mood.
Discusses on a desert island on BBC Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Michelson, a horse out of shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record Sunday when he plays the 47th Raider Cup contest, but he will have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Mikkelson, who plays the biennial event, record the 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double pairs and fours.
Rather than being the focus of attention, as it often represents the United States, the five - time winner, he shared the time to cheer and exercise on his game, on the range, in hopes of correcting what is being said.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow field of Le Golf Nasual, where distant rough blows are a regular punishment in carelessness.
And if the ground itself is not scary enough, Mikkelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces the precise champion of British Open Francescal Molinari, who plays in couple with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual competitions, start hard, the game of Mikkelson can be crucial.
Furic expressed his trust in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understands the role he played today, touched me on my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the celebrity, and he's given a lot to these past and week teams.
I probably didn't think of him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it went down, and we thought we had to do it.
He likes to play, like everyone else."
Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played games of the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Ryder Cup where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halves, though Furic said his presence is bringing something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, resourceful, he likes to joke with people, and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun in the game with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant leadership in front of individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an incompetable position.
The taxe was debuted at a competition in Valderoma in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but "they crossed the line only with the noses", with the smallest lead of 14"-13.
"I remind myself that we had great leadership in Valderoma; we had great leadership in Brookline, when we lost also in Valderama, when we won a little," said Bjorn, a figure, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead on Le Golf Nazil.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
The walkers are ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play it right.
This isn't over until the game is over.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
All the time I say, I'm focusing on 12 players on our team, but we're fully aware of the opposite side -- the best players in the world."
Add Bjorn satisfied with the results of his players on a difficult golf course: "I don't want to give early grades on that issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
The individual games await us tomorrow, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all the skills like a golfer are tested.
That's the message you need to send to the players, give it their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they did in pairs, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furic himself was at both ends of last day's change, as he was part of the Brooklyn winning team before ending up as a loser when Europe took out "The Wonder in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on middle games.
We set the line properly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is given the task of resisting first and facing Rory McLroy the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flatwood and Ian Polter in the most important half of the line.
"I decided to act in this way with the boys because I think we'll cover everything," Bjorn said of choosing in individual games.
The new German warship has been delayed again
The latest German Navy frigate was to be delivered in 2014 to replace obsolete wartime warships, but this would not happen until at least next year because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Reinland-Faltz, a new class leading ship of frigates, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the daily DiCyat, calling for military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014 but troubled questions after delivery prevented the fate of an ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Witberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be a substitute for the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and rockets, as well as some stelt-technology, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic tracts.
Among other important features is the rarer maintenance -- it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, permanent delays mean that modern warships -- which should allow Germany to have power over the oceans -- will already be obsolete as they enter the service, notes D.C.
The fregue with unfortunate fate, F125 reached the front page last year, when a German Navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blom and Vose in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy brought a ship back to a shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the causes of the return, but German media are quoting a number of key "Social and Harder Detects" that make the warship useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly important because ships of the Baden-Westberg class would have crews of about 120 sailors -- only half the crew of the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It also turns out that the ship is drasticly above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
Reinland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the troubled hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including crew training -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - an increase of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings of Germany's reduced maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, confirmed that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The envoy said the problem has deteriorated over time, because the old ships have been withdrawn from service, but no ships have been provided for replacement.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Watemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to bats' secret life
A new survey of property in Scottish mountainous areas is being carried out to find out how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that the discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide protection activities in the future.
Studying scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow ordinary and soprano bats, as well as brown long ears bats and dabington bats at Inveru Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bats' activities during the season.
The En-Aich-Es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analyses of the sounds of all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the bat species.
A map of habitats will then be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, an adviser for nature protection in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life are most important to bats and how they use each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of living things, such as the creation of meadows, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and Britain decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects beds and the loss of habitats.
Winds and lights are also a risk, as well as sticky flies strips and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as domestic cats' attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
Yet, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
Ann-Ti-Es, who cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even based the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on Triv property in Damfris and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many strange things about bats, so the work we're doing here and other properties will help us find out more about what they need to make progress."
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats have been made before renovating the properties because the unconscious destruction of the beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, torture, or upset or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a school clerk at the Bat Protection Corps, encourages the public to help.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about bats and other species of our own, we just don't know how they live."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, lawyers sue German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called rape charges "false news", and added that people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, which announced the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker is accused of raping an American named Katherine Majorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid $375.000 to keep him from talking about the incident, Der Spigel said Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram of his 142 million followers, hours after the accusations were made, Ronaldo, 33, rejected reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is false news," the five-time gold ball conqueror told his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for the accusations they called "inadmissible transfer of suspicions from private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damage because of "moral damage in a row that corresponds to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the allegations took place in June 2009 in a turn of a hotel and a Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped anal, according to documents filed to a court in the Clark District of Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good boy", but dropped under that "one percent".
Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to a contract without judicial participation because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says it is now asking for a change in the treaty because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and this summer moved to Italy's giant Juventus with a 100m-euro deal.
Braggzit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain will always mourn if it loses the status of a world leader in car manufacturing after Braggzit, said Minister for Business Greg Clark.
He added it is "concerning" that Toyota-Brita told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burston, close to Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japan's car manufacturer said that the impact of border stops in the event of Bragzit without a contract would cost jobs.
The Burston factory -- which produces Toyota Aures and Avenue -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"According to me, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a stop to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, the managing director of Toyota in Burston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain have expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement going to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Bem-Em-You, for example, says he's going to close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Braggzit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the event of Braggzit without a contract.
Toyota's production line works according to the "once time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there can be a suspension of the border that the industry considers could cause delays and shortages in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory supply at the Derby factory, the company said, and production would stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "just done to avoid such border checks".
"We should have a deal. We should have the best deal that will enable us not only to enjoy the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told Radio 4's programme of the BBC.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota, but also other producers, is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but cautioned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has been working in Burston for 24 years and has been a union representative in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesman, "We have set up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "responsible for another week" as he continues his fight over Brett Cavanaugh's nomination as Supreme Court Judge, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential violations of the laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire his deputy attorney and thus threaten Miller's independence, he has been causing gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein was considering wearing a recording device with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But by publishing the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was in the United Nations at the time in New York.
Trump said he would not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash at the Senate Justice Committee's hearing, which they testified in, and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blyce Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavano, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
To the question of meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not been established yet, it could be held this week, and it could be delayed for another week, given all the things happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see how things are going and I always try to keep the press properly informed."
Some journalists argue: Saunders has not held a briefing for reporters at the White House on September 10th.
The leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the small number of briefings is not due to the lack of affection for the "great influence" of television journalists, though he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a great impact."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president is organising several sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without stating evidence: "We have examined those figures."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it's far better than to talk to me.
We've been trying to do it more often and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time over the last few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace the briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when coming out of the White House or when taking part in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with its uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance to the gathered journalists.
letter health secretary to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system over Braggzit fears
Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and the desire for them to stay behind.
Jean Freeman, an MP in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the costs of determined EU citizens' status applications operating in public services at a lower level.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, in order to make the expected decisions this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of not reaching an agreement.
I know this time is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate each member of the staff, regardless of his citizenship.
Fellow Members from all over the EU and widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and are of useful importance to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombi subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Christian Abercrombi, a defensive player (linebecker) of Teennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tannessee State's chief coach, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and was just grumbling on the ground," Rid said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombi oxygen outside the playground, then put him in the van and carried him to further evolution.
An official from the Tannessee State told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had gotten out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Centar Medical Center.
Haris added that "there is still no information on the type/ injury rate" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually took place.
Abbecombi is a student in the second year and plays his first red piercing season in the "Tennessee State" following the transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five Saturday's rallies before exiting the game, resulting in a total of 18 rallies this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
Move to neutralise Korbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbin's success in trying to attract young voters with promises of affordable housing and to focus on high earners.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds strengthening the government's efforts to improve the homeless situation.
The additional amount which, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can be up to three per cent.
The ministry expects the move to collect up to 120m pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which led to price hikes and caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time in the process of buying property.
Many of the country's rich areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced only weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction firms of offering high land prices but did not use it and asked Ms. May to change the quotas for accessible homes in order to correct the "suspicious housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive home reforms, including controls of the household and ending evictions for no legitimate reason.
He also wants counsel to give more authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to returning British sleep, that is, making life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to buy homes in as easy a way as for harmful British residents.
The dream of owning your own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "end ambition" is in the future to become the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which is currently third in the first league with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to "The Stadium of Light" after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B hat, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's "Sportsoon" at BBC.
"But I grew up all the time looking at Scotland in "Hampden" with my father and always something dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity could only be given if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors are Dick Advocate, David Mojes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Pojet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any anxiety knowing that he should follow established names in such a large club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success is being evaluated at the moment by "Can I bring this club back to the Prime Minister League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Prime Minister's League," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I will probably think I've achieved success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross works as a manager for only three years, in which a career came in after working as a assistant to the head of Dumberton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts coach.
Then he helped "Alloa" recover from the dropout in the third league and returned St. Mirren from the edge of losing the title at the Championship in the next season.
Ross says he's feeling more comfortable now than when he was playing Clyde, Heartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroad for me," he recalls taking over "Alloa".
"I honestly believed that career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, made enough of it, and enjoyed certain high powers.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I am still going through certain things in the sense of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life."

According to one research, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profit of British pubs currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The numbers show pubs and bars saw an increase in the sale of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA company for business consulting services in determining these numbers said: "The sun's time and longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of pubs rose by 2.8 per cent and the restaurants decreased significantly.
The decline in the sale of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June has worsened even further during July.
pubs and bars that mostly sell drinks have seen a much higher increase compared to previous years than restaurants where a decline was observed.
The pubs in which food is mostly sold were also badly affected by the sun's periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems that people simply wanted to come out for a drink.
Successful pubs and bar sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, and food sales increased by only three per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for rest and hospitality from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw in late April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
There is no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the fall in sales of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly overwhelming as the addition of current pressures creating costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of locals in which food is mostly sold and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the much needed rest."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a halt in publishing new brands.
The "Coffer Peach Tracker" device to monitor sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of the same of 47 operating groups with combined income of over 9 billion pounds and represents an established reper for the industry.

A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
News has increased the fear that sexual content is being published on such accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean "head" profile showing their parents, and they have other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter of the same teenage girl who asked others to "rape him."
A survey carried out by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistures' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secretive.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online accounts where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elide Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the board of "Scottish Athletics"
Elyde Doyle was elected as the failed director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and President Ian Biti described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to exploit her extensive experience at an international level gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities has great respect for Elide and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a board member," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I am ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope that I can really make my contribution and help in the proper direction of sports in Scotland."
The American who won the titles at 200m and 400m in the Atlanta Games in 1996, along with the winning four gold medals at the Olympic Games, which now appears regularly as a commentator for the BBC, could not go after having suffered a transitional ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if we were to recover or to what extent.
The whole process was agonizing, but I managed to recover completely, I could go back and practice my agony!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Job for a breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows causes a division of opinions on the Internet
A company for the production of chest pumps caused division of opinions on the Internet when it published an ad in which breast-feeding mothers are likened to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's ultimate building pump", the user-oriented technology company Elvie published a ridiculous ad inspired by music videos to show the freedom the new pump gives to mothers who are reaching.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay in a song that sounds like this: "Yes, I milk milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these are not names, these are my breasts."
The ref goes on: “Pumpa, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts.”
However, the ad that was published on the company's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the dairy industry's "happiness".
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, with the exception of the fact that their children are being stolen from them only a few days after they are born," one of the comments said.
Elvie's breast pump is discreetly integrated into the breastplate ("Elvie").
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a chest pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Truely inappropriate advertising."
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that the song was truly “false. ”
"I think this idea is genius.
I would have bought a pump like this if I was still there.
Inhalation made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I think it's sincere.
It's a genius product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial intended for mothers who milk (often at their workplaces or toilets) and feel like“ cows. ”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing while discreet pumps were shoved in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use dairy pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely quiet, has no wires, no pipes, and is discreetly integrated in the breastplate, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out of their homes while milking.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR in Mother, commented: "Elvie's Pope" is a really revolutionary product and deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who milk and milk cows, we wanted milk to be milked with the aid of pump and the challenges it brings to the center of attention, showing the amazing sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has been present in all headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children migrants in custody has increased significantly even though border crossings per month have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were self-detected immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child's sponsor.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would need to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified last week to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"There are almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to process cases with children more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules in line with which some of them would be required to appear in court within a month of being detained, not within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard was being voted.
Many will appear through a conference video, not a personal call, in order to bring their case of legal status to the immigration judge.
Those considered unlike to receive relief will immediately be deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they will become distressed and depressed, which could lead to violent crackdowns or attempts to escape, shelter workers say and reports that have emerged from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornilo, where due to its size there is a greater likelihood of neglecting the signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time for them to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can increase the traumas most of them already face.
Syria told US, French, and Turkish "opupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Malum called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Mualem, who also acts as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces had illegally resided in Syria's territory under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they would act accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately, and this without setting the conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to lead this holy battle until we clean up all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on this country's territory destroyed by war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accuse "some of the Western countries" of "widening irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to ease these returns," he said.
"They politicise the issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with assistance for reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent deal between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed at jihadists, including the Nusra Front-related fighters with al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Stafan de Mystura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Mualem laid down the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "a view of the members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in it.
Why Trump to Win Second Mandate
According to that logic, Mr Trump will win again in the 2020 elections unless there is an impeachment and scandal prematurely ending his presidential term, which is likely to be hoped by many liberalists.
In what will no doubt be "The most dramatic finale in the presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue among the viewers.
As of 2014, impact-time ratings have increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million in GMNBC.
Nilsen says that "Fox News" averages 2.4 million viewers at the time of impact, which is 1.7 million more compared to the four years ago, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" at the SMSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers on the evenings when important news was reported.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main TV producer of the drama "Designed Survivors" of ABC for the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capital was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skkel, veteran of writing comedys and author of "Just the Funy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was voting for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Skkel told me.
There's a certain fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the Washington stories can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
The exclusion from all of this is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have been looking at a panel of experts who debate the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a skin bomb from a John Manafort of $15,000 "a dress with thick arrogance," as he called "The Washington Post") and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy by Storm Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
"The part of what he does and what gives you the feeling of watching reality show is that it brings you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" for the rotating team of the Trump Show and everyday twists (FPL stands, Kim Young-un fan).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Fleece this week, it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watched "MSNBC" while filming "CNN".
He couldn't stop looking, at least not when Brett Kavano was supposed to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember we did all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flash told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Inflow of external funds in the worst mid-term election of the Upper House race
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania Congress Area is receiving large amounts of funds thanks to the reorganization of the congress areas from which there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is run by democrat representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another area of emergency elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Kit Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th congressional area, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th congress area.
The maps were modified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old areas were manipulated for the benefit of Republicans, contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congress area is a difficult competition to fund campaigns among party main sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congress Committee for Campaigns ('DCCC') and the National Campaign Committee of the Republican Party ('NRCC').
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania following a close victory in the extraordinary elections for the 18th Pennsylvania congress area held in March characterised by a wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupying a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the area by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats little advantage.
US decides to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then quit
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to pull US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only in terms of El Salvador were given penalties, which received US aid of around $140m in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and killing rates.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar assembly last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they want the conference to progress and in an effective way to end any thinking about punishing El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pens is scheduled to address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
Both US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of difficult messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal reflections on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that could happen is to announce the report by Special Adviser Robert Miller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, which is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller allegedly also directs his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before the voters, perhaps even before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many uncertainties here, and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable or his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed to do that, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The current of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy has accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such points of change.
What if Mr. Trump quit Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man controlling Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot chair after the newspaper announced that last year he proposed to secretly film the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for the function he is performing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How will we act if Brett Kavano's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a congress that will accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fall for all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath table with a swastika logo.
With this legacy, how come I'm not optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of Ringers with an optimistic stance ahead of clash with "Rapid Vienna"
Rangers are hosting a clash with the "Rapid Vienna" Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after the unresolved match against "Villarreal" in Spain at the beginning of this month, victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in League Europe.
Graham Dorens, the midline player was prevented from appearing in the season until the unresolved 2-2 game with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a leapboard towards greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and returned with a won point.
We might have been able to give a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first half, and we did our best at the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, another great European night awaits us.
I hope we win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll return and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that happened, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can now move forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear picture of the way they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had talked to their marriage mates about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they do not take steps to discuss it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the company for life insurance "Nationwide".
Here's where you guys start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for your concern if you do not share your desires with them prematurely.
Work with your adviser and your family and discuss where and how care can be obtained because such elections can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your adviser may also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your elections to finance long-term care may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or secure yourself with your own resources, if you have them.
Edit your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the start.
Take full care of health care so that the disabled can trust to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the full help of your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person of confidence to make financial decisions in your name and pay your bills if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the medications that his allergies are taking?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about finance, but about who doctors are?" Martin asks.
"Who are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan like this."
A man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home from getting out.
The victim was about 40 years old in Oxford Grove district in Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police appealed to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of victims expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, people cannot obtain information from Dongala County, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 Palu people were evacuated after the disaster.
Further, a few key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesi province, which is at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that extends more than 300km (180 miles) to the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue for the economy of the Central Sulavesi province, particularly the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but is largely concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesian disaster relief agency says that Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific fire ring and earthquakes are regularly affected.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Acheh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 22,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them were residents of Acheh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the West Coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit an area near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 - step earthquake hit one of the islands of Mantawa, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis reaching 10m and destroying dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow focus earthquake hit Pidi Jaja County in Acheh, causing wilderness and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, the earthquake caused no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested over domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice president's candidate, Sara Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, by Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, a mix-up in a report on family violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police officials in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Matt-Su detention facility with the possibility of leaving if he pays $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitively innocent" when he was asked how he pleaded before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A class violations, which means he can be sentenced for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also accused of violations of the B-class, I punished with a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before Alaska's veteran court is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, meddling in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he supposedly hit her on the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after saying that her son's violent behaviour stems from PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the area near Central Sulavesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
The social media is circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the Palu beach festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terror Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Syfolo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that hasn't been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used an rental truck on Home Depot to launch an attack on the West Side highway in lower Manhattan and run the pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "imposedly" killed the eight victims and "insultly" caused serious bodily injuries, according to a report on the intent of seeking a death sentence delivered to the South District of New York.
According to court documents, there is a possibility that a death penalty may be imposed on both the foundations of the indictment.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal grand jury filed charges against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for recycling purposes, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "determined planning and thinking," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as "grassful, cruel and distorted."
"Syfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, damaged, and lost families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lore Det, Daren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the country's intention reported.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death penalty case was prosecuted in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was committed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of plotting spying on the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by an electric capital on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told the investigators he felt good about what he had done.
In line with the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police also said he asked for the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded to be innocent on all 22 grounds.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they "are obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence, rather than accept a confession of guilt and to pronounce a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only extend the trauma of these events to all those involved," said Paton.
Saipov's defense had earlier urged prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Tori party MP says NAJEL FARAZ should be in charge of Braggzit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the Tori party conference, promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's lawmakers proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bon on March in Birmingham said the United Kingdom would "be out of the EU" if Mr Farage was the secretary of Bregzit.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May in terms of uniting her deeply divided members was highlighted by counter-Brexit members of the Tori party who joined a special protest against Bragzit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Ceckers plan despite attacks by pro-Bregzit persons, counter-registered persons and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue their attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bonn told the Leave Menans Leave assembly in Solihal that he wanted to "refuse the Checkers plan".
He suggested that Mr Faraz should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would be out of the EU by now," he said.
Velingboro MP added: "I will support Braggzit, but we must reject the plan from Checkers."
Voicing his stand against the EU, he said, "We did not fight in world wars so that we could be subject to now.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejects the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to remain in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori Party and pro-Bresit, also attended the march and told reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Checkers plan is not well received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out to the streets and who owe our victory to the elections.
Please give up the plan from Checkers and start listening to us."
In a directed message to Mrs. May, she added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said at the assembly that politicians must "have to feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to turn Braggzit in, and we're here today to tell them that we're "not going to let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Braggzit, to feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country to give us victory in Bregzit and that will not stop until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Brezite people marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly in the city centre.
After the group's assembly, a small number of activists appeared this weekend, wearing banners with a "Torievci vs. Bragzit" article.
Lord Adonis, a Labour Party member laughed at conservatives for security issues they faced at the opening of a conference on the party's application.
"These are people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus plus the border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as good Braggzit," he added.
Warren plans to think well about running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says he "will think well about running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about its future during the town hall in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, honour critic of President Donald Trump, will run in November's reelection against Republican Party State Representative Jeff Dil, who was co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was at the centre of speculation that it could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday's afternoon event in Holiok was her 36th meeting with the voters after Trump came to the presidency, whose maintenance is using a city hall format.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top."
Arrested suspect on the shooting case and the death of basketball player Simms by the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms from the LSU team that took place Friday was arrested.
Baton Rouge's police department announced Ditheon Simpson's arrest, 20, at a press conference at 11am east time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, requesting assistance to identify the man from the recording.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Sutern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms had a gunshot wound to his head and as a result died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, "247sports".
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, owned weapons, and shot at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at the police department of East Baton Rouge.
As a 192-inch junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Simms played 32 matches with 10 performances last season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls captured after the game.
Grant Pri to Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to world title after team with its orders secures victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the moment that on Saturday, Valterie Botas qualified to Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
From the Polish opposition Botass had a good start and almost left Hamilton at a CD while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel entered the box first and left Hamilton to fight the mess at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered boxing a round later and came back behind Vetel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action one of the ones that forced Ferrari's driver accidentally to leave the interior of his free risk to stay away after the double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstopen began from the back row of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he led to most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish and reach Kimi Raikenenen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxing of the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the other eight rounds, so Raikenen came in fourth place.
Today's a tough day because Valterie did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team has made a really remarkable decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finestein at Saturday's rally on her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blacie Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of a sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "innocent and dishonest."
"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and wicked and careless and untrue," he said.
"When you look at publications and information leaks and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Finestein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we announce-- No, we didn't announce it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information about Kavanaugh's accusations was sent to Finestein in July, and it was published in early September, but Einstein denied that the leaking of information came from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not publish her story," Finstein told the committee, reported "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she wanted."
But the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same rally Saturday: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad speech on the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Continueing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, their meanness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to run to regain their power and control," the president said, as the president declares "Mediaite".
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in the Dundee contest
Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the Elina League match on Friday against the "Belfast Giants" by winning a 5-3-to-Dandy rematch on Saturday.
Giants took advantage of two goals reached by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney made an advantage for the host before the Dyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Busher equates to "Dundee" before Lucas Lundwald Nilssen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third loss in the season within the elite league for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned to victory over the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning in the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFol added, which addition was secured by David Rutherford while Bovelier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan provided the host's leadership 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to achieve the result of 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants took the lead until the first break, when he reached the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned with a powerful game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen for the first time to secure the lead of "Dundee" in the game late in the second period, and he ensured his team's victory in half of the last period of the fifth game.
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next game on Friday at the Milton Keys Homefield.
A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane rescue from the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller is celebrated as a hero after he died helping him fly hundreds of people safely to fly.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong consecutive tremors continue to devastate the area, and many are stuck in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, while his colleagues fled to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Duffro Airport in Palu, which was unstoppable.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's plane with the number of flight 6321 at the time was on the runway will fly safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower the moment he thought the tower was crashing.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims is believed to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot even access," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six metres were ravaged by Palu, where a mass funeral will take place Sunday.
War and commercial planes bring assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "The speed of help brings bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and ordered the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Aeronesia plane crash: “Air Niugini” now say that a man has disappeared after the fall of the plane in the lagoon
The airline operating on a plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man has disappeared, after earlier stating that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the plane that was sinking.
The statement "Air Niugini" said Saturday afternoon they cannot find the male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Knock Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital Saturday and everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low.
"It's an extremely good job," Janes said.
Janes said he and the others managed to cross the water that reached half and headed to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the port reconstruction also helped rescue with the airship moving people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air safety data indicate that 111 people were killed in accidents of airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini airline.
An analyst found a time frame on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up presenting the case Saturday for a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rovelet, an analyst from the United States Department of Justice, testified for hours as a mastermind in the field of intelligence analysis.
He noted the jury's use of phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rovelet said he received data on the location from several cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, said "The Clarion Ledger".
When on the basis of the data it was shown that his cell phone was with Chambers at a time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that that day was not in the city.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "false because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records indicate they only knew for a week.
Rovelet said that some time after Chambers died, Telis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should present its final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is that conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to refutate the negative view of this genre by including positive messages in its music.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip-hop has strayed from its origin as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their revival through such artists as "Akal" and "Lowkey".
Another black one?
A New York nanny sues a couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a couple for being fired on grounds of discrimination after mistakenly receiving a message from the mother who complained about the fact that she was “another black woman. ”
The couple deny that they are racists, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lyncy Plasko-Flaksman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of the new nurse Giselle Morris found out she was a black woman.
"NEEEEEEEEEE IS ONE CURNING," Mrs. Pasco-Flaxman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what Plasko-Flaksman actually did, feeling "uncomfortable" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, had done her job badly and expected her to be out of the Philippines instead, reported "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and was then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and seeking compensation for the $350 discharge daily for six months, an engagement that will include her living with the family, what she was initially engaged to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple responded to the lawsuits that they were racist, saying that Ms. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable act because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Pasco said for "Rest".
"But would you trust your children on the face you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Let's be realistic."
Saying the lawsuit is "excessive", Pasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going to attack someone who's in a situation like this?
That's not very nice" added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect to a bear that speaks, is revealed in the new letter
Karen Jankel, a Bond daughter who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself on the spot of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all of this about the huge success of Paddington.
After he said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, had been inspired to write a book of a small bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work had not been well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For "Paddington", which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride in his potential success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But since you felt "Paddington" so realistic, it was almost like you had a child who had achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to yourself.
I think Paddington's success was the way he accepted it.
Although it was about the creation and fruit of his imagination, he always attributed his merits to "Paddington."
My daughter was on her deathbed, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
"Ned called to tell me regularly that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive," said Mrs. Evan-Laperuz.
"Then Nade called to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effects of the medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly decreased, and they came out of her system.
She died before, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I could not scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay restrained."
In the end, Mrs. Evan-Laperous mourns the loss of her daughter on a plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bent my head down, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for over.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieved women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide are making efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the Wells Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Leedney says her son had great potential for becoming a chef, as well as an infectious smile.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said that his smile could brighten every room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly fear that it will have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis is making cards "to let others know that there are people out there who can talk to and who can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married 15 years after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or he didn't say anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas Day when children opened their presents, and he never looked them in the eye and made any contact with them."
She said that his death is a huge trauma for all of them, but they must find a way through it: “This is what breaks up the family.
He's got us broken.
But we have to move on and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain since the FBI launched the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, that is, an investigation with limited time, with a limited range, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flack said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee "are falling apart" in conditions of a rooted partisan free state.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican party supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their morbidity is due only to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, on November 6th, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbied to support Mr. Kavano who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the unresolved outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has "reduced" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea towards South Korea dropped after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, an MP from South Korea said.
Park Bjeong-seuug, quoting South Korean Uniting Ministry data that last year there were 1,127 crossings at the border compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs for human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of North Korea’s refugees are eventually granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean people have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where is the longest border with North Korea, and which can be more easily crossed compared to the well-protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not fugitives, and often repatriates them in force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the suspension of de-uklearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho charged on Saturday sanctions imposed by the United States for staging in progress since then.
"If there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelossi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysteric" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysteric" and said that if given his temper, he was inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say it was "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh, in an emotional way, denied the allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blassi Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavanaugh was very emotional at his opening statement, sometimes even shouting and licking as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "the grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it proved to be addictive to the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Cavanaugh from office if allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is in office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she is concerned about the possible rulings she will bring against the Law on Accessing Health Care or Roe in the face of Wade, because it is believed to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings for confirming his candidacy, Kavano did not answer questions about whether to overturn some of the Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysteric, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "That is really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's a really sharp criticism, months and years of collecting anger that she can't free without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She went on to say, “A woman who was doing a executive function somewhere, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but managed to develop her own technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she was telling the person she was talking to, “You might think I was sad because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's genius."
Tears are permitted as an exploding valve for anger partly because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my brightest memories from one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated is when I once started crying with an unrepentant anger and an older woman, a cold manager from whom I always had a certain fear, grabbed me by my neck and dragged me to the ladder.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've managed to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987 when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called Monky Business and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-thinked decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow and the Seven Dwarves."
Given the fact that the campaign had long been launched, it did not have enough funding, so it promised not to enter the race if it brings us $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters, who gave men 1,000 dollars, would only give her $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overpowered by emotions, or gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you'd seen me you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder remembers how the media reacted to the incident.
"You'd think Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She's crying"?
How a trade war between the United States and China can be a good thing for Beijing
Opening the fire with the start of the trade war between the United States and China was contaminating even though the battle is far from over, conflict between countries could be useful for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president warned at the beginning of this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation markedly escalated during this week by introducing new tariffs worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), which effectively taxed half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing was returning to nature every time, or recently imposed tariffs from five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the United States with the same measure, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same thing soon.
To get Washington to step down means to accept his demands, but public bowing before the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, pressures from the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China in the long run because it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that with a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing may create conditions for the start of a sudden decline from an economic aspect in any of the countries is much more dangerous than was previously established by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, who represents a Tink-tank.
Syria "ready" for refugee returns, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has remained devastated by a long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore its state to normal.
All conditions are now being ensured for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally imposed economic measures that affected their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Malem said the Syrian regime hails assistance in the rebuilding of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional help or assistance from countries sponsored by the rebellion.
Europe won a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe beat the United States team in the Rider Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a European field and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its acceptance after the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
US star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, took his first blow from a hole to the water in pair three of the 16th hole, losing to France's Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari noted in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who achieved a score of 5-0-0 after the tournament began to be organised in the current format in 1979.
America's Jordan Spit lost 5-4 of the lowest-ranking player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant of eight Ryder Cups, became the European winner who won the most titles in the 25.5-point tournament during his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been really hard this year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy that I could help," said emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He is now giving his fellow countryman John Ram his place, which on Sunday one beat Tiger Woods, the US golf legend, with a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
It's about incredible statistics of one of the best players of all time, which won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to low grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furic said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
During one period this morning, we put in trouble the team from Europe.
We fought.
Kappa down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Association of Professional golfers of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it to them.
They've outdone us.
