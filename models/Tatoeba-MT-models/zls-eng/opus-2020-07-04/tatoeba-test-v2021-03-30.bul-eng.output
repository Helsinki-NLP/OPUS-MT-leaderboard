Mary threw an eye on Tom.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.

What's the time tomorrow?
I'll clean it up.
She gave me a nice doll.

Talking in French is a big party.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
This spring is late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much less.
You haven't given me as much change as you need.
I might be able to find time to help you.

You don't understand.
I'm used to my parents ignoring me.
I'm extremely busy.

Looks like they're onto it again.
I'll keep that in mind.
Just close your eyes.
She kept the secret to herself.
Is that your pen?
He disappeared without a trace.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think that should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.
His desire finally came true.
Would you like to become a trusted user?
I'm getting confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They serve excellent food here.
Tom, where are you?
I'm gonna study French this afternoon.

Please be patient.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend some other hotels to me?
The rain stopped me coming.

How did I miss you?
When I grow up, I'm gonna marry Tom.
It's gonna be a start.
How much sugar do you put on?
Looks like she's got a lot of friends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees began to cover themselves with leaves.
Watch my fingers.
She speaks well English, but not as much as her brother.
I was really confused.
You don't eat the cake I made; your sister eats.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Don't speak French today.
I think this is yours.
Stand up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
This is Tomovo.
I'll come too.
Can I open the window?
Let's ask him.
She's on a diet.
Speak up so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.
Will you go back to the beach this afternoon?

When's the last time you went to the beach?
Don't back off.
Because it was raining, we didn't go for a picnic.
I wish Tom could have been here with us today.
I'm in the house.
Do I have to open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I need to get to the hospital.
Let me see that.
The news made us excited.
Are you cold?
I'm never king of anything from Tom.
I need you.
I like to listen to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak a little French.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll get a job.
Do I have the right to accompany you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They get along well with their neighbors.
Tom didn't say anything about that?
French isn't that hard to learn.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come home.
No one else has offered to help.
Get your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What's the purpose?
If we just stopped trying to be happy, we'd have a good time.
I forgot his name.
We're in no hurry.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the station after the train left.
I've never seen a whale alive.
You want to wear my jacket?
I'm not going to ask him.

It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to find out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.

We're always looking forward to Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love kids, don't you?

Unbelievable!
That's all you can really do.
It's time to get a good-bye.

What else is in your pocket?
There was no place else for me to go.
The man pushed her away.
A hug from you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting for a little bit.
I hear Boston was nice this time of year.

I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of coming in on time if everyone else is late?
The wind rush blew the rain right in my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be pleased.
That's no problem.
Did you leave a tip?
Looks like no one's home.

The station's downtown.
Don't even bother coming.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
Me, too.
I don't like how you behave.
What are we doing here?
The object is beyond the direction of this investigation.
You sat in my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You've got to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.

How are you today?
I'm really interested.

That's not Tom's problem.
Hold the rocket tight.
Going home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were dating Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't teach.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's a bit of a pain in the ass.
I think what Tom did was really stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a language holder.
I'd like to find an account.
I heard you talking.
We immediately became friends.

Can you give me a light?
He drinks his coffee clean every time.
I don't have any information on Tom.
She found a job as a machinewriter.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should have worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what do I have to do?
Clearly, Americans can't solve even their own problems, so how do they even imagine they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a tickle.
From now on, I'm gonna study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was terribly cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
We were out of our mind.
I think you'll be happy.
Teenagers quit.
I wish I was rich.
I barely started.
If you need anything, just call.

I've learned a lot of things.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I was wondering if my e-mail had ever come to you.

They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he ate something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
The green is good for you.
I bet you know French.
For dinner Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the seashore.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasama?
I wish everything Tom said would have been a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Any kids?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all of our politicians are too old?
We can't hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most.
Some say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I love taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French guilt?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom was sitting on a denier.
The girls danced in the gym.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
I finally stopped in front of the old house and saw the city once more.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit I'm snoring.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, that's too bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mom has good handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom put his shirt on and then put his tie on.
It's cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she treats everyone well.
Ken plays football every day.
You're welcome again at any time.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust the least.
Could you wait outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What's stopping you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was sentenced.
The train went through 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact.
The principal considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Could it be love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom's got two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountains.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
People across southern Germany will see farms with solar panels anywhere they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ring.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'm going to ask you to deliver this report to French.
Nobody's confused.
Everybody jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than the middle height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful shirt.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't know Naeline Tom so well.
I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the past ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you asked for.
In a mysterious way, a sense of humor is related to national peculiarities.
Swiming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He forgot to feed the dog.
I need to look into things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be an astrophysicist.
Tom vomited blood.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just really disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you leave with my younger sister at the same time?
The match was delayed for an unknown time.
His brother's learning a lot.
Ken's arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
Thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary wear her coat.
That book for the kabus could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Will you call Tom, or do you want me to?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's disgusting.
What's the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I'm looking after him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him the wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
It doesn't change anything.
I'm meeting him at noon.
The invitation said there would be popcorn and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that'll help.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike's running too fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you should meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth visiting.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
You speak French, too?
I started learning French recently, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom has small arms.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a nice trip?
He made me a costume.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to carry Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for that job.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
My internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's at Tom's now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists arrived.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twins look exactly alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
And I was sick.
I've got some really bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you're entitled not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted an invitation to visit Mary's celebration.
You're not the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily ever after.
I'm angry at myself.
This is done by Tom himself.
You won't believe what kind of stuff people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry a lot of luggage when you travel.
I got Tom's photo right here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They both work.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her that she lied to him.
There's no point in being fooled, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He needs to be given advantage in front of the others.
I got you.
Take it with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made fun of me publicly.
The circle burned down.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Slow it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
This is amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the photo I took at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken to Tom in French.
We all agreed that Tom could speak French.
Tom went back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do what you want, but I will prevent it if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I think I'll learn how to swim on vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me go crazy that easily.
It's 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped over the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is snowed.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
There's a really good restaurant right next to the beach that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What is the minimum wage in Lithuania?
There's the hospital I was born in.
He that sows these winds will reap storms.
According to data from the latest census, the general population of the country is slightly over 7 million people.
Provisional measures will have no effect on drug dependence.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted of death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, right?
I don't have anything.
For once, think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it for a while.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I don't have anything to offer.
I'm talking to my employees in French.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so relaxed, I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to be feeling well.
Is the trip gone, too?
I promise I'll get it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out!
Tom's wearing a raincoat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The proposal for work is still in effect.
Your shirt lacks a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Green is good for you.
Fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me that watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Is he playing tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
In this store, they're dealing with kitchen equipment.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom answered us right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is cute.
Please buy me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay until the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does any of your team speak French?
It looks like it's going to rain snow.
I've never seen one like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I never got on top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
Probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debates.
Eat a living frog every morning and the rest of the day will not happen to you any worse.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't blink last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody's feelings.
Nancy smiles.
If you're going to France, you have to refresh your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're studying French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should quit.
Please have patience.
Your joke is far too far away.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need this.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wanted to be single again.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
Uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are an animal, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week, I ate pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter became a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my check account.
He was here at the time.
I put on my shoes right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are tied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to have lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom's got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're gonna play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he discovered that Mary was missing.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you good luck.
He was home alone.
In the Esperaran, the existing ones end up on "o." A number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to become a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
Triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard French is a hard language.
I haven't eaten quite a bit.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's working for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol went back to his hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is snowed.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
He's off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
There's no memory of Tom yet.
Hand it over to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was woken up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can contact the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you telling me?
I'm looking for something not that expensive.
It's a lot easier for Tom to speak English than it is in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
It's a little bit late.
I like that color.
My grandmother had surgery in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you with Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask for Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom's going through the drawer to see if there's any pen he can use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great?
I don't like that.
I don't want to belong to a elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has achieved good results.
By that, of course, his ignorance.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French ain't good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll set up a farewell party for him.
Which club do you belong in?
Azushu may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading again and again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He graduated from Cambridge with a distinction.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom study French at school?
What shoes are they?
We've certainly worked hard.
I'll delay my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He started making excuses.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll be here by tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I quit.
You and half don't know.
This is the photo I took at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big town.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a Web site, just be careful not to break anyone's copyright.
Tom was protecting his wife.
She has a wonderful handwriting.
The fingers of the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless and puppy.
The film was made of polyethylene.
I've decided on the light task.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much is a taxi coming out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have a lot of English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiased began his worthy respect endeavor.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
In the beginning, local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more accurate.
I'm on leave this week.
You're doing your laundry.
I promise I won't do this again.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Could you tell me your name, please?
This kind of error is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Does the game look to you?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom was trying to convince Mary that it was time for them to leave.
She wears her makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make me look good.
I don't have any money.
Milly eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
Long skirts are now democracies.
He's doing very well with kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
It finally stopped raining, and the weather warmed up.
She wasn't much of a measly hint of what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used correctly are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you pass me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to study French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't do it like you're walking around, start messing with people's addresses.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got into a traffic jam, and I couldn't make it on time.
They went to the Naval Museum.
Tom has made a lot of efforts to improve his French.
It's been lost in vain for a long time.
They weren't talking.
I didn't call you stupid.
He's speaking to me in French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support, when you fail, is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His shirt was covered with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom's not gonna get any help.
You're not gonna be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What are you doing, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was cleaner.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom came home on a bus.
For me, one meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What have you got to do?
Tom studied French three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What is this?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
There's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's split the 50 to fifty.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when the meeting would be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about the people behind their backs.
She's a grown-up.
Come with me, let's go for a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well prepared, don't worry.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees whose leaves silkworms live on.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
Put it in my pain.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been struggling with hepatitis for six months, but it seems he's recently started recovering.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you give me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bend before their illnesses.
I wouldn't think the tofu was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't had my vertigo yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned how to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I've got gum pus out of my gums.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about this, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends, and eventually everyone will understand.
It was cold.
Tom's talking to a French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the park.
I thought it best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you see carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
This is the sweetest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not a bad guy.
In this restaurant, the food is nice.
I don't do that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
The unemployment is what they create.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
That's a great poem.
Lately, the prices have fallen.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late with the transmission, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to carry Tom on the other side of the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the door cat.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There was once a lot of frogs in this pond.
I understand that perfectly.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers the French to the German.
You can read in French, right?
Fred's often late for class.
Don't cry.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you that dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend will come to visit tomorrow.
I hope that's what's gonna happen.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You will!
I'm afraid I've affected you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's deprived of experiences.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom paid no attention to Mary.
Put on those slippers, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like this color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's got blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
In the next semester, I'm going to study French.
Tom's not going to make a speech today.
I'll see you tonight.
I'm out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing ever happens the way you thought it would.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children must obey their parents.
Is there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come on Sunday night?
I remember meeting you before.
I'm looking at him as my best friend.
Nobody picked up the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're studying the Esperanto.
The new bike cost me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it until later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so shallow.
I have great news.
It looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel collapsed because of the earthquake from the day before.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What have you been doing all this time?
My uncle never wrote letters.
Shut the goddamn door!
We made fun of him for that.
John came in a week ago.
He refused the offer, so did I.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The barber is a man who shaves the beards and cut the hair of men.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be resolved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom used to sing, but no one wanted to listen to him sing.
Tom didn't lay on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm an office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the Kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I won't be there in time.
He often walks to school.
The porridge stinks.
When are you getting married?
This is a phaser.
He's off the train.
You're awesome.
How many episodes of Van Pyce have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is there a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're cute, and you're sweet.
My sister lives next to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
It wasn't my intention.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I'm begging you, so please spray a little insecticide behind the fridge.
She told me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your luggage.
Soon thereafter, it started raining.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permissions.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says goodbye to friends and wishes me a good night.
Let's check it out.
So far, you've done a good job.
I cooked dinner last night.
Tom can't stand up.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you for your cooperation in advance.
Who told you my name was Tom?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him herself.
I got a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them?
As usual, the physics teacher was late for class.
Let me make it clear what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I get a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You sat in my seat.
I've already tried this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this bathroom.
You're in a winning series.
I want to have a drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for anything other than taking care of the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The film wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be disturbed.
I don't think Tom's number is in the book.
Can you do it yourself?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's the one she's stuck with after dinner.
These containers are closing Hermetically.
He's the best player on our team.
I've seen you before.
There isn't any.
I want more information.

He says he avoided danger by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot.
Isn't that surprising?
He's making friends with everyone he meets.
You have to study harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.
He broke into a house.
I arrived later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was shivering with fear.
I was your mother's first friend.
The fight has ruined our unity.
How much money do I have to take with me?
Tom's good with the French.
I'm into stories like that.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget tomorrow's Tom's birthday.

I've been waiting for him so long.
Aren't they cute?
I can't change those plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was on a business trip.
I had a little fever this morning.
The medicine works.
I can't walk anymore.

Is this the right direction for the museum?
School starts at eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breathing is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We're out of our mind about you.
He can't read.
You're doing very well.
Conversations won't solve anything.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and memory of the new words taught.
I think they know us.
I don't intend to hurt you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was wearing red T-shirts.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say cheese.
Tom's not gonna get paid.
The rain stopped me coming out.
When I was your age, I had to walk up to school, both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thank you.
I already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot yesterday.
That won't help you.
Just do what Tom says.

You're not coming?
I'll be here by noon.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be pleased.
Let's not talk about this again.
Then where's the problem?
It wasn't that heavy.
This is business.
Please lock the safe.
She interrupted me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to study French.
Tom gave his card to Mary.

He didn't do it, Tom.
That's the job I chose.
I think we're out of gas.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.
What is the minimum wage in Germany?
We got something for you.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I don't eat pork.
Your coming here was a mistake.
The newspaper published a profile on its new editor.
It's been a failure since the beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she finished, my daughter flew from Osaka Airport to Germany.
The boy laughed at the girl.

I think Tom's a good name.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom may object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think you'd better give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to give their children good education.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.
You're going to London next Sunday, aren't you?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You don't seem too surprised.
It's obviously working.
I have to teach Tom that.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumped out the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you back.

You're bleeding.
I just want to be with you.
I want to study French.
She's eating apples.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the party.
Are you happy?
Why don't you get yourself an umbrella just in case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Are you done with breakfast yet?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about this on the phone.

I had to walk there because my car broke down.

Don't punish Tom for this.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom scored three points.
Do you like walking on the beach?
When are you leaving?
Is there anyone with you?
Tom couldn't believe what was going on.
Did you have fun last night?
To put it straight, he's wrong.
They're already here.

I'm bringing her back.

We're getting married at the end of March.
He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good luck to you.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He married a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Don't you have any interest?

I'll be back next week.
Stay with me, Tom.

Even though Tom's English sometimes seems pretty good, he has no idea how far his capabilities are and it's impossible to convince him that he's not right when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I saw a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you arguing with Tom.
You're gonna pull over?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is a man's best friend, and inside the dog is too dark to read.
It doesn't work.
My mother made a very nice skirt for me.
You need to start right now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in some community service?
Are you interested?
Apparently, Tom was famous even before he published this album.
The Romans would have no chance of conquering the world if they were first required to learn Latin.
I paid 50 bucks.
Don't drink this.
I think we better get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clean the table already!
Mary's interested in politics.
She's not gonna believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Do not hesitate to ask questions.
Bees make honey.
Tom doesn't want to admit he doesn't know how to do it.
I'm the only one who knows them.
They've been in this town for 350 years.
I'm playing a TV game.
He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Still collecting stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports exceeded their exports.
You don't have a fever.
Has anyone told you this?
I'm not afraid of dying, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What kind of man would do something like that?
I don't like the snow.
Jane waited, scratched her back in the tree.
We'll do our best.
Let's go upstairs and talk.
Tom hasn't called me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes look good.
I've studied French for three years.
I think you should get out now.
Please leave.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom seems really happy.
I never heard Tom speak French until yesterday.
She's French.
Soldiers are used to the dangers.
I know a little French.
Please write your contact address here.
Bon appétit!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We arrived first.
Can you make it?
The police found a body thrown off the coast not far from here.
We all speak French.
The gentleman knows best the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
Make sure you turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands trembled.
From now on, be careful.
Tom jumped in the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something with your life.
I hope things get better for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the one who needs help.
The corridor is slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to tell your parents that thing.
Let's tell each other the truth!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land belongs to Tom.
I think you should meet Tom.
Do not add anatomy.
No one's here yet.
Your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He plays well on the guitar.
Have you ever played Maincraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any drugs right now?
The tree's on fire.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We took turns driving.
Can I get your coat?
My dad's gonna make me a nice dinner tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just closed the phone.
You ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come and see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom's not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept filming.
Less and fewer teenagers work today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very beautiful, but it's legit.
Shoici's face is pale.
Electric flow can generate an magnetic field.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
I have things to do tomorrow.
The tower was broken in powder and powder.
America is very big.
I heard a car stop.
Send her my regards.
Is your wife a blonde, or is she a brunette?
I'm out. I'm driving my bike.
The men were taking the boy to the hospital.
They talked too quickly to find out what they were saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera Tom took the photos with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given an opportunity.
Could you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
Don't chew on me.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's kind of weird for me.
Can you do it yourself?
In the spring, the days are getting longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my dad singing in the bathroom.
English is being spoken in Singapore.
I eat bread.
That request was rejected.
You were right.
He was tired, and he went to help them anyway.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are tired now.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We were playing for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The circle is burning.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I will always remember your kindness.
This smell, and I've felt it before.
Everyone's dying.
I don't get it.
Give me a hammer.
He hates shopping.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a paper worm.
I think you're capable of anything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should do this.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants something to eat.
This box is a little heavier than it should be.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still in school?
Texas is almost twice as big as Japan.
Or you, or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hook next to the door.
Tom lives three blocks off the coast.
He's a little celebrity.
I love pizza.
I'm gonna try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom confessed to being scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as funny as the book.
The job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of all of us universe - a part that is limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task should be free from this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it covers all living beings and nature in all its beauty.
He'll definitely be here.
I know.
You're not going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this form in French?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who it is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became a director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What's that thing?
Never give dog food to your cat.
I'm having trouble with the French grammar.
I got him through the face.
I'll make you happy.
You're not gonna believe this.
Do I have to open everything?
It's totally different now.
You're always late.
Let's move on.
The walls were painted in light brown.
Betty killed him.
Did you start studying French yet?
You can't read French, can you?
Your blouse suits this skirt very well.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
You really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down there.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my older brother.
She became famous.
She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you on stupid.
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that makes me nervous.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Does Tom live far from here?
Bad weather wouldn't let me leave.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.
My legs are up.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and get a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to know when Tom's going to go.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants to get divorced.
You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I heard gunshots.
I had no intention of putting you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate that for?
If there's a wish, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel a lot better.
Are you done with breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom wondered where Mary had spent her childhood.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom, and Mary took out their guns.
Do Cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually sits.
Tom was sweating.
You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually talk in French.
I'd like a blouse that fits that jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
You're always complaining.
Milk is sour.
Second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We need to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The Devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother said he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate it.
The problem was, I had nothing to tell him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I have a few calls to make.
Whatever happens, we'll get them to talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple took a trip around the world.
When I woke up, nobody was home, and I was abandoned all day.
My math is my favorite object.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom's back to get his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom came home covered in mud.
Have you actually tried?
Storm stopped the plane from flying.
Tell me you have good news.
Which browser do you use?
I remember what he said.
What is the minimum wage in your country?
I think you should think about it again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader are you gonna get - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I usually run every surtrine.
The bell rings at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith is charged with a breach of contract.
Ken's running faster than you.
They talked to each other.
Are you asleep, honey?
She gave birth to twins.
Five gallon normal, please.
I haven't been here much.
Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put on your robe.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
Yesterday was a terrible accident.
He answered the right questions.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste time.
Why are you here so early?
Judging by your great tan, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably snowing tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura might have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was a museum of art in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
His luck will end sooner or later.
It looks like it's going to rain tonight.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time you were traveling by train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if the meal isn't ready by seven hours, I'll go to a restaurant.
He let me wait long.
I'll be right there.
They made us work all night.
He really likes English.
I heard about your party.
They have to change their attitude.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
It's an interesting book.
She was young.
They're hiding in the closet.
What is the minimum wage in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to understand when the train is leaving.

Do you like music?
He was born and raised in Tokyo.
I pretend I'm working.
She waits until the water boils before she makes tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.

He was very patient.
They're not likely to come in this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months he would make us all speak French without stopping.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
There's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And no one's ever said a word about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon on the train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you some sushi.
Come on, so much for today.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.
Save a man, eat a cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French awful.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please, give me an envelope.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
He asked about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His fog kept him from seeing far away.
Anne's a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the mail to send a letter.
Look carefully at the map on the wall.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in nearly three years.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
I've lost my form.
Get me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
This is very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight down the road, and when you pass through, you're there.
Do what you want.
Some people would certainly ask, why don't we just get our stuff together and step out of Afghanistan?

Would you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Have you seen Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back!
Say hello to Jimmy for me.
I haven't spoken to Tom in three weeks.
Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you made a mistake.
He didn't mind standing up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have intolerance to travel by sea.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
I don't know any of the guys.
We're ready to go.
That's evidence.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard footsteps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her one sheet.
Uncle gave his car to me.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I've got to get dressed.
I don't think you understand what's important.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
The broad jackets are the last scream of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little good will on both sides, our problems should be able to be resolved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbed up the stairs.
The house we used to live in is torn down.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
Prices will continue to rise.
We study French together.
In high school, French was my favorite thing.
Would you mind calling Tom?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Take me off this side of the lighthouse, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why aren't you laughing?
Have you ever congratulated Pfirsichäumchen in German?
It was an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this research.
Wouldn't that be nice?
I don't know French. I don't know Greek.
He made it clear that it was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I have so much sleep?
She answered through tears.
When are you leaving?
Hanako is older than her mother.
That's completely different.
The elephant is gray.
I study French at home.
Don't make so much noise, please.
Have any of you ever seen Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me that list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son's getting married, and we want to make our heads straight.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you going to eat that cupcake?
I've been working hard for the past month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking to each other.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This could be a little heavy.
Looks like our water's at an end.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green one suits Alice.
Our junk is gathering three times a week.
They caught the fox trapped.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're too late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak up, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel very bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not just a necessity, but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's eleven now.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you studying French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use deodorant.
When I get up, it's your world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There's some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to do that.
You don't seem too surprised.
It's a warning we have to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you help us quickly?
Let's get a jacket.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is trained to speak French at all times.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People in general are against the war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom taught me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What tooth hurts?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You sat in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
We study French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about me.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13 years old.
Her hobby is collecting stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were to talk more than we could hear, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
Last night we had a great time.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom is.
Did you do it?
My father often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He hasn't known anything since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I've heard my hands in my pockets .
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He became a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
They're all hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, I was studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you better sit down.
Our sales are falling.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid for your lack of attention, please send out your due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
This is where it smells like toilets.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was saved by a random passerby.
City Hall's downtown.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar's full of people.
I'm terribly hungry.
That's very kind of you to turn out of your way to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city that Mary lives in.
It's almost 11 without a quarter now.
Both excuses are correct.
I've never seen a eclipse before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
Nobody could sleep that night.
Rhonda lasted about five minutes.
He was going around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I have to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll sue you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs in?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, I can read what's left of it.
I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.
Mike's swimming very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that'll take me away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the best friends of the girl.
When he was young, his parents died, so his uncle raised him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I've got a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arrangements.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is hard.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a private beach.
Why did Tom want to study French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how it works.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. Colt's Japanese food is starting to like it.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to focus on that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom's teaching me how to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to get an account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix it.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know either guy or guy.
Guests have to start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
It looks like it's going to rain.
It was very nice to meet you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruit rots under the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes in the control.
Time is on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take some time.
I thought you might give up.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Look out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
Now I think you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happy.
He's only four minutes away by train.
What's Tom trying to do?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we better get going.
Tom said it probably won't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, come on, keep your mouth shut!
I would never hurt them.
I studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you down?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's foggy today.
You live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he was gone for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's get some rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were interested in Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom is twice as old as Mary.
Mary's got two girlfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You've got a wreath infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I screwed you.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the cash in the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
Give someone $20 and you never see him again, so it's probably worth it.
This is Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make that decision today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
You're French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we're going to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check account.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of pronunciations about DNA, but there's not one about RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to that.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind was blowing on pores.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Twenty students read the book only one.
I have a job Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I'm back home on the train.
I think I can do it in my free time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you do that in?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter to French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the head of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, it's awkward.
But he had an allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
In those days, there was no television, no radio.
She went to the museum with a taxi.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes on their heels.
Tom likes knitting.
You're a good doctor.
Don't ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric light.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a bunch of kids he shouldn't have.
It'll be good if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed every time I use a string of teeth.
We arrived quickly because the movement wasn't busy.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He recently returned from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those glasses look good on you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until the catch-up is over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's looking at a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't work for me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when did Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so embarrassed.
It looks like there are over two thousand Uigurian sentences in Papaba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed of what I did.
Let's cut in here.
I know this is hard.
Are you a exchange student?
If you need any help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
You think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good night tonight.
Don't take it back yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
The fact that he's too generous is his biggest flaw.
Press Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane was always acting like she's very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
Nothing's working out.
I don't mind hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new cards.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers go out without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
Check, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and release this letter in the meantime.
That henhouse has recently taken no egg.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school goes well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
A lot of people are going to lose their jobs because of the collapse of the car industry.
He came to me for help.
We'll start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food is at an end.
The moment of glory for Hanshin did not last long. They were quickly shifted from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Doesn't that lead to trouble?
He was resentful of being a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
You really want this?
Will he fail the exam?
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they reached?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you are.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put the pie on the kitchen window on the pier to get cold.
He's happy that man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, that's pathetic.
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth ball into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Doesn't he interest you?
It's a great pleasure to see baseball games.
I think you should take a break.
When did you start learning French?
She cut her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it'll rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them?
Tom, how is he going to deal with this?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't spoken to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera is Tom's, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're pretty important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Check that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not much fun.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
See you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I plan to go to France.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Budstrasse and get off to Zestrassasee.
Laughter is useful to your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everyone was telling me about.
Add this site to "Preferred".
When the sun of culture is low, even the dwarfs throw a big shadow.
When is the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meet at the mall.
I'm not going to face the threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Do you have a tickle?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying up late.
Tom's fine.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I get your knife?
You have to hand over the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in nearly three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're still going.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water to boil, let alone fix a turkey.
What's the name of that river?
Is she free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the shorts are covered with ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Give it back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I won't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French as French.
I think we should make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket register?
I'm really pretty busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little sick while I was dancing, and I got on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom smiled more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking down the rough road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind is yours.
She took her exam.
I'll study at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made some mistakes at the exam.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where have you been?
I've got to get it out.
Can I do something to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's already a grown man.
Let's not fool ourselves.
I've made up my mind.
It's not art, it's a tooth vagina.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
Have you heard of him?
She washed her shirt in a hurry.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Tom really wants to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you're wearing different socks?
He makes a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice and Saturday night.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
A letter card.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I won't be able to help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother every once in a while.
Men get into shape, riding a bike.
This is not the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend to me?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there such an expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just pull your thumbs.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep country.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammo.
You're my best friend.
I organized a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She became twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What is your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's running.
They yearn for city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came running with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom surrendered too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary talking about it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw away those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was affected by a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out till too late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
Nor did I say that.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter on her own.
Can you solve this task?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me this before.
It's been six years since I started studying English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work as a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Can you help me translate this?
Tom doesn't know anything about French.
This is the same hospital Tom works for.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air-conditioning spends a lot of electricity.
Don't get attached to this range of propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be cancelled.
First the good God made the man, and then he made the woman, and then he laughed over the man, and he gave him the tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or something.
Does that look familiar?
Get your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost done.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi's dancing.
Machines can do a lot of things for people today.
He went for a walk.
Please, start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from a flat feet.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Man's stupidity is endless," I say, and because of this self-discretion, I consider myself an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter to French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what you'd like, Tom?
The whole road's going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got a tooth last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't cover up how you feel about this.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom's sick a lot.
The key doesn't fit the lock.
What is the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned on the lamp again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Pick what you like.

Our teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put on her sweater.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President, with such bad gums, she hardly even has teeth.
I haven't seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cosy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why didn't you try the dress before you bought it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a rock.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They went straight to their goal.
The boy went in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
Check, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
The constant is being paid off.
They arrived separately.
Talking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being observed from alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking around the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Don't push me.
I think you need to grow a beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another soda?
Many people share my view.
The blouse's clear.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his great endeavor at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't have to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be burned.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Sort the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French a lot smoother than I do.
I'm gonna hide in here.

If a sick woman folds a thousand paper cranes, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you any!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you quit?
I want my shirt back.
I had my vacation in Hacone.
Take a look at those papers.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom started the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Cook 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather stopped us from leaving.
I'm studying French now.
Since I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm terribly busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're in a winning series.
I can't be mad at you about that.
The spread of television significantly deprived us of our time to read.
I'm gonna need forever to explain everything.
Don't rub it in my closet.
The new Coronavirus is highly contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm here unofficially.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and toast toast.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me with greatness.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.

I didn't understand the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses somewhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone was coming in.
Tom's on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian too.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?

I never should have let you do it alone.

I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is reborn.
Keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about a promotion right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't talked to anyone today, except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks medium-sized coffee.
I'm disappointed he's not here.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just got word from Kansas concerning your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Does this new model have it on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect anyone to like you.
What's this really about?
Watch out for Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
The third quarter BNP exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything there?
They were all at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it like you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much disease as lazy.
Aren't you afraid, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study at my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV too.
Let's go to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He's watching TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
Participants prepare for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't bother us so much.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be okay.
That's why Tom won't know anything.
Don't forget to bring kitchen supplies like knives and cooking vessels.
We're here.
Where are you going?
You want to come with us?
I promised myself I'd never do it again.
Jane runs to school sometimes.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen a koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He went for a walk.
I hope you're right.
No less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think it's true.
I lost track of time.
He thought it might be a trick.
He's the greatest poet ever.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and nobody loves anybody.
Tom put his knee on.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report this.
You're pretty good with French, aren't you?
He postponed the party.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They've got five butterflies.
You did it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Put the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
I saw his father arguing with him.
Keep your room clean and clear.
I had a rough night.
She didn't like her husband.
I've studied his face for scars of exhaustion.
Music is the common language of mankind.
Give me some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It would be a pleasure to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom's interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
That's Copacbana!
Maybe it's true, but I can't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Watch me do it.
We're going to the movies.
He often goes to the movies with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I hear Tom's membership has been suspended.
I'll be by your side if you go to do it.
What's the name of the Boston hotel he was staying in last year?
That's a complicated problem.
It's 10:00 right now.
It's raining like it's out of the blue.
Are you single, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We're not here after 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I bought books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I like sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to understand.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done here.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest innovations in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I have no interest in doing this.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it down as lost.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand in hand with rejection from society.
Did you count the towels?
You need to get a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
A lot of scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't have done that.
You're a good singer.
Cat eats.
I'm used to my parents not paying attention to me.
Speaking of travels, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He educated his children well.
I was just being nice.
Tom grows tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks shy.
That's made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm very sleepy.
Be more precise.
I was on leave.
No one will know.
Tom comes out to drink every night.
The museum's closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his belt on.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy shoved all his clothes in his bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him to the chair.
I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Are you in debt now?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays firm.
The problem seems a lot more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
First I have to tell you something.
A coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have any other choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the first family, then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy was a pale reminder of his father in appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop because of me.
How do you tell them apart?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't bother them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has problems with alcohol?
Will there be anyone at the station to meet me?
I haven't heard from him in these months.
I don't play color.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
I kind of understand that question.
Why aren't you here?
Tom is the man who gave me this bike.
We won't fire under the pressure of the tyrant.
Tom is a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
It's so good to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you mind weighing this?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
Nor did I say that.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have subordinates that speak French?
I don't have much to talk about in French.
Ask him about his way to the station.
He went fishing during the day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I quit.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works in a wine shop.
Tom had nothing to do.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at 6:00 in the morning.
I feel awkward with her.
We don't want you to feel pushed.
Stiffs are dried grapes.
I've been to India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of opportunities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't so bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He's playing baseball after school.
Sounds like a terrible scream made him shake.
Do you have this shirt in black?
It wasn't a party.
Well, you ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg talks too much.
I took my stuff off.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no room to worry.
We have a physical.
Did you have fun yesterday?
This sweater is worth over 50 bucks.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know what they were called.
This is for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in the shop.
I've got an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
You cut your shirts before they rubbed.
I'll be there.
Don't get up too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
His investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, you'll need them later.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
That book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I've taken the Master 58.
I think Tom's scared of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Unbutton your shirt, please.
I almost forgot.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign stamps.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We've gone to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You've been drinking since my class.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the job going?
I wrote some songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone is a convenience.
Do you sell French papers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I couldn't handle the lights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom is very modest.
Thank you for that.
Al-Balka, Turkish panic, he's watching Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school where Tom intends to sign up.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We have a very large lotus list.
We firmly believe that when I make sentences, the author should avoid submission to harmful habits inherent in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are in fact absolutely extra in the light of the target meaning.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Stay down," make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When is it over?
I get sick every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the exam.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two pounds of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is this near your house?
Jane filled out one claimed one.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
The fools run where the angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been in sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you want me to come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for this to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there are kids around.
It's easy to catch.
I want to improve my French pronunciation.
You're not gonna believe what I heard.
I'm going to study Tom.
The train is ten minutes late today.
You've become quiet.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should talk in English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The check won't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct a test report on the date of the test.
Maybe we're avoiding the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll follow your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan practically every family has a washing machine.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The Raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, the scope of your research, your main interest?
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hi to Tom.
I think Tom might be drunk.
I've had a lot of head.
Why don't you sleep?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's little chance I can't make it to the meeting.
You always said hello with a present.
How do I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read quite well.
Tom's okay, right?
She stared for a while in the paper.
JF Kennedy was buried in Arlington Cemetery.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any drugs.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll make it to the Hades tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
My favorite football team is falling.
I've easily tied myself to his sweet talk.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language holder.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until there's more light.
Tom hurt himself.
His room's a mess.
They take part in their spare time to care for the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom is going to go.
Ask Tom.
Drop the radio.
I'll stay for three more days.
We postponed departure for tomorrow.
Nature knows no boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to find out what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You'd better put a sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't get into the museum, it's in reconstruction right now.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming real fast.
Add this site to "Preferred".
I have a lot to say on this one.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what concerns you.
The worst part is it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain, and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
He's threatening us.
You want to buy that skirt.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French.
Are you going?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They adopted the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been having a French journal for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You're learning French, aren't you?
The girl's used to playing alone.
I play in a group.
The birds sang.
Tom's doing business at 5:00.
Even though Tom left home early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
The time will come when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get to the museum by bus?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be exact.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule where gold is, and it sets out the rules.
The house is haunted.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that isn't forever is forever old.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss.
I bought it for 10 bucks.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I'm shooting.
Have you heard Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's happening.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children don't get basic knowledge of numbers.
I finished philosophy at my university.
What beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the work of young employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do that.
Whatever you do, you can't make a man believe in anything, even less of yourself.
I don't feel very well.
Air conditioning doesn't work.
You're sitting in my seat.
Is there something that scares you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to study French.
I want MP3 player!
Where's Tom?
I'm shaking my mind about it.
I paid two hundred dollars in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you understand.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of retreating for a while, let alone not mention breaking up with him.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you'll do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we've got enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
In summer, I bathe every morning.
Put your shirt on.
Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it on time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruits in front of oranges.
This place is worth visiting for once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister smoothed out her shirt.
I've told you this another time, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's time to go?
I'll pay you a visit tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like an orange juice.
From the moment I got your book, until I left it, I'd be laughing all the time, and someday I'm gonna start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's tight for the round.
That's what I've seen.
The dolphin is a mammal.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
At Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
Goblin calculators can be bought at the price of a pair of socks, but need thousands of British children at school, not less than pencil and rubber.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk and do bad things against people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'll borrow money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For the cold time, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's running around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people visited the meeting.
He's wearing his coat and he's out of the house.
Daddyba's new website will pull out a home hyper database, built by the basics search engine, and go to a Daddy-OS server with a Daddy's CPU made entirely of Daddy's.
The old man stopped her.
She hated calling her a coward.
I like it a lot.
I never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the kings.
I don't intend to apologize to Tom.
What do you do?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What would you recommend to me?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
Who's the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, and Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Tom, can he come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little.
Tom's not used to city life.
You kept your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar on.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden have died.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His destiny is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between piano and violin, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Don't break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This species is threatened.
I think you better go to bed.
I like you very much.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving on packers.
Do you have medical insurance?
Look out, Tom!
Sunday, the museum is closed.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't give up.
It's going to cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost didn't win.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's a friend of mine.
You're looking at this the wrong way.
Something's happening.
Fill it up.
We have a small chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if that's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved obsessively against what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police are investigating the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We finally saw each other. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little bit more?
Are you wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we need to look into things.
So we're all in.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you're gonna be a great father.
There's no way you can contact him.
Never give up.
Could you show me this bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You're not gonna believe me.
Can you come by at nine?
Let's sync our watches.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a worthless store?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I had told you, a croquette Fedada.
This is the camera Tom took the photos with.
Don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man far away.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I'm supposed to be resting.
She said she wouldn't move and inch, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not rush.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make haste conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
The wine is the milk of the elderly.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he discovered that Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
I'm sorry.
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy deep asleep.
She called it what she didn't.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were congruent with cold.
It's authorised for dogs.
Kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel my invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep moving.
It's a challenge to me, and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was upset.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
It's one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we're gonna make it in time.
Being a troll is an art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodyguard.
The man eats bread.
He's going across the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please pass my greetings to your family.
When someone mediocre sends a message to a bottle, it's just a childhood fantasy, when Christopher Columbus sends a message in a bottle, the fate of an entire country is on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
The kids are playing dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to act human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about it again.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums did you visit?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room without taking off his coat.
Last Saturday, I went shopping.
It's June 18th, and Muriel has a birthday.
The way he works does not show anything he can boast with.
We don't see things the way they are, we don't see them as we are.
She gently pushed the door.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote a few sentences in Berber.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
That's when I visited the museum for the first time.
Is she staying at the hotel?
I don't like that jacket.
Tom and Mary went down the stairs together.
You're early.
You want to leave at the last minute?
He's an atheist.
I thought you might be mad at me.
I give up.
I know her very well.
What's in the beach bag that's in your car trunk?
I don't trust women.
He's an atheist.
Drugs can ruin your life.
Don't leave, Tom.
