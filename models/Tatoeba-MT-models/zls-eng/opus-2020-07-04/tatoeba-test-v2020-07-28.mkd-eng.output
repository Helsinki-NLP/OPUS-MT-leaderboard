It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaved.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That's gonna take some time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I turn to you?
Do you like the bike?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's quit them.
What's it worth?
Our water was all over the place.
Tom pretended not to notice Mary watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom lifted the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
You looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom has returned last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen so far.
You've chosen well.
Nudists consider the nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Give it back to me.
The wolves stalked the herd.
That song's been haunting me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay for the lodge?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
You ever shot a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
For free, get a ticket.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom's inebriated.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
Nobody trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
What about meeting tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the loot happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I never thought I'd find him.
The competition for that job is big.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to redeem himself.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looks around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little peeking in the cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have denied an answer.
I'm obliged to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit his gum.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you made it.
We didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It's been an entire evening.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big of a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop lying to Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take a subway than a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rewinded the movie.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Do you buy these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go.
Excuse me briefly.
Take off your hat.
Playing's very good.
Please, don't mumm.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Are we really supposed to eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you take it back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary had been married before.
Would you like to sing?
You're lucky.
I run my nose every time I'm cold.
We've met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
Tree's green.
The moon's surface is incorrect.
I'm trying to explain this to you in such a way that you understand.
Everybody's looking for luck.
Did anyone else enter the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom treated me like shit in high school.
Tom wore a hat on which the price was still on.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if I asked for it.
Tom is obedient and even obedient.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run!
Is he paying for the delivery?
I want you to repeat.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You've never seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes are transporting malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also receive checks.
Visikov costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom's drinking plenty of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
One shot.
Macedonia has four verbic ways: expressive, conditional, orderly and betrayed.
They haven't gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her traits as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are true to me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy be next year?
That's exactly how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a seal.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
It's a big yard.
It's a children's game.
Tom, you don't care.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom's got me in the shit.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
You've had a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to take a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't attract attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick a favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a trelaika.
Who you got on your list?
He's got a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, bro.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
Why don't you like it?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for his birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom's spending a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about is food.
Make sure you don't get fucked up in that mud bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are meals included in the price?
That would follow.
You want tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Souna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom, the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a red room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I stuck a slap on him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do it.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly distressed with speaking, because of the difficult manner of speech.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather's malfunctioning.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were in vain trying to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than run away.
I'm licking myself.
When do you study?
Tom had a hard time swallowing pills.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is careless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by males.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right to it.
Didn't you hear me scream?
Let's take a walk.
Don't overeat yourself.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Pull out the fastener.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
What don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
So you didn't want the reward, did you?
Look at the dymon.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're untruthed.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at this glowing star.
I don't know how to help him.
Tie up.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory's up.
We're broke.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son's not a snob.
It's from Tom.
He doesn't even have a hand in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Have them call me.
The power drill warms ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task comes out of skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys fell off the roofs.
Let's forget about it for now.
Because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quickly receiving data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll reassemble the whole thing.
I don't really know.
I couldn't stand it at first.
His sleeve's on.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone's gone except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are blocked.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They were banging next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked him to do.
Tom accidentally told everyone that I died.
I think we found one.
The reporting deadline is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I carefully examined the situation.
Tom's just a regular man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We gotta get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame on you!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved concerts very much.
Ask them to join us.
Where am I supposed to park?
Does he care about anybody?
How's that for you?
Tom drank from the bottle of wine.
I fell off a bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks broke up.
Tom talked Mary into donate money.
I got it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie Old Dog?
I just bought myself a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I proposed it.
You're weak.
Tom's starting to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You're talking too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran down the hole.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
The mustard is really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30.
She's gonna have to leave.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They've blocked it.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you were hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as you can.
Tom would've figured it out.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfying?
Tom put his hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that the previous dentist told him he'd remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Do not expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
Something's wrong with me.
Tom's a smart guy.
The curry in the powder is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This has been a sad night for me.
Tom was driving around the city with his brakes up without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
You want camping?
Who broke the toilet?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to shut Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Take care of yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning around in his grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unjustly, not realizing that their own conduct is undesirable.
He's wearing high heels to make it higher.
Do you want a bowling alley?
Excuse me, I think you dropped something.
All you need to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I like to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does that have to do with anything?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're such a stubborn woman.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made his decision.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to mountain.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used too many expressions.
The bucket's in your energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big deal for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I fear darkness.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom's a skillful writer.
Something very similar has happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to score the idea.
Tom's really pissed off.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repugnant.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose list is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes lit with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "So do I."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's go on foot.
She just wanted to meet Tom.
You need to ask for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom is richer than we thought.
I never intended to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have a wish like that.
I called a few faces.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
He apologized.
I can't find the address on the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
The hardworking, butterfly, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to get you this as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom scratched his knee.
Where did the pinnacles come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I've got to get some rest.
Can I look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but it didn't work.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink carbonated drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You cook turkey with bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going to what he wants.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan drank five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I already feel much better.
I gave them one more chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's too bad concrete's not burning.
Why does Tom do this?
Tom stopped at once.
My dad used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm threatened.
Tom arrived early.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
Always with his English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have roofers?
None of the pigs failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are glued.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom packed his bags.
How does that benefit?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, and you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
Room's packed.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate one another?
I didn't hear it.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got what he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never surrender.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've ever seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom's acting really happy.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had an illness, and she suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know, and I can.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, get better.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't step on it.
I'm not safe here.
To my great sadness, Mary came to the party in a prostitute's dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get lost.
Beekeepers remove the sword to collect the honey.
I have to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't forget it.
Tom won the fight.
Bring them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom had his eyes flashed when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you even help us?
It might be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many large cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he actually is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they eat them people.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I'd forgotten how smart you could be.
Can I see that one?
He spends all his money, he's water.
We're not talking about anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not really sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
This book weighs.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's always lying to me.
The rooms in this hotel obviously do a very bad noise, and I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk around the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you squeezing me?
Please talk to me.
Angels guard us and lead us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't help anything.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was at his disposal.
Tom's going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is the phone.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom's the real hero.
Where did you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That's what you did.
These goats are bald.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second he'd try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played monopolis since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
She was standing in front of her.
There's more exits.
Tom has always protected his children a lot.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six flax.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I have not yet found time to write that report.
I can do it anyway.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
It's cloudy.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I'd love to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to rot?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about the sandwich?
I know what to study.
Surrender the assembly.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was too much blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everybody here loves you so much, Tom.
Today at noon, we'll eat cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
Watch out, that's a cruel bull.
I'm taking Tom home.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need a sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was uncircumcised.
It's a good night for me.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the teacher.
Water is the source of life.
The sinisters that fell off the roof fell apart.
Who is the ruler of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have kicked us out.
Tom wasn't ashamed.
Just finishing the report.
Come on, hurry up!
You better go.
Tom hit the exit.
I've got two cameras.
What'd you find?
Dan admitted to Linda's a heavy drunk.
That's Tom's drawing.
Game's not over.
Tom put down his drink.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't fight me.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no good here.
Anybody hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary screaming.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
Amebis are life-long.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Does Tom die of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The waves make the wind.
Get a clear glass of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like how the French write their word about "bubamara".
The diesel can raise twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's risky without any help.
You're good for that?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into dice and fried.
Ask a professional.
I love travels.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom found it hard to deal with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom erased his forehead.
The book has not been translated into French yet.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large amount of money from the rich.
Nobody ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
A conscience bites you, doesn't it?
I wanted blood.
I need one minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should've asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a handkerchief, your nose's running.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were initially farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you repent of.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We've set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish I'd stayed.
She's got ten kids.
Tom stopped me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy right now.
Tom was still dressed in pajamas and bathrobes when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're hurt.
The sentence isn't exactly grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any more questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are more predetermined.
I've tried.
A broken tree interrupted the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
No more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
He's doing his best math.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
He hurt me and he called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were travelers.
I think Tom's vanquished.
Some fish can change their gender.
I can get it from her.
Get some food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
He's making us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and at every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Good night.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not unique to the semi-strength.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out a pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long is this medicine to be taken?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not record their happiness.
I still don't know what we're supposed to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I should get my house.
We didn't make it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I teach him English.
Usually what causes the pain?
We're dependent on work.
This box is made of tin.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's evil.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all ingredients in the bowl.
There was a lot of sperm.
Tom's very boring.
I've been vaccinated against flu.
Just try it.
I want to play, too.
Tom was a piano professor.
Tom was one-time.
Is Tom interested?
I got it right here.
I want to talk to you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I'm never surfed.
I'll find something.
We had turtle soup.
We can work outdoors if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's jewels.
That cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom was acting a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I'm hiding Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They told me you know how to do this.
You're tempted.
What does she not want to do?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom was acting upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not wise.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
I'm friends.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of my day here.
Should we wait here for her?
If you go out like that, you'll catch cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything, Tom?
Everybody busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom got hurt.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We made a Quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All the stores are closed.
You've done white again!
Stop sucking your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We're out of use.
We believe in God.
We must do our utmost to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go alone.
I was the one digging this hole.
I don't want to know.
Do you agree with Tom's associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them home.
You're a racist.
I forgive you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I can't believe it yet.
What's a shortcut from?
Thanks again for coming.
They're cheating on us.
The wounded soldier barely walked.
The sun just came up.
Actually, I know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What keeps Tom from doing it again?
Tom goes down a lot of movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
Light is turned away from water.
Tom's piercing the soup.
I don't fuck you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can we touch you?
You miss something?
Have a man sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We were walking among the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd stand on Tom's side.
They couldn't get away.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a Cavalier.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
You were blowing your party with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is that you don't give Tom any gifts.
Tom was working.
Tom used to live right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom's putting his hand around Mary.
She's got short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He's down the hall.
Can I think of something?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary are probably never gonna see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's got a lot of debts.
She knows more important capitals.
What's under the roof?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom, all their drinking tours.
You ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom came to them.
You think you can trick me?
My name is Ivan.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her league.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rough.
That's not a good reason enough.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pen.
When do we have to start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk.
Did you buy the cure?
Did he drink tom?
It hurts my work.
The question is, who's gonna do it?
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
This guy's pissing me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would really like to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please ask me anything.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a Wunderkind.
He's going to school on foot.
It's starting to get into our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom's acting very haughty.
Now the question is, what are we supposed to do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
Ended in fourth place by 56 runners.
No, no, no, no, no.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with the girl who lives across the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom excited Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
You're singing wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I don't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are threatened.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He's got huge potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We've heard very carefully so that we don't miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jaws are condescending, and they get even better once he has a few beers.
You've got mylied eyes.
You don't get into business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he can't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, yeah, it'll be fixed... when the crow gives birth to grapes.
Tom's an advisor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me an ass.
How long has there been fireworks?
It's possible Tom is lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't betray anything.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
I'm losing my hair.
The big question that no one has found, including me, despite thirty years of research on the female soul, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The villagers reap harvest.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the invasion?
I can work where I want to work.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the object?
Every break, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're Vegetarian.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can also scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't understand how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a measure of success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you guys talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert ended with the folk anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
You ran as fast as you could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's plenty of air here.
She married nothing of a man.
Wind's down.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to put on anything in there.
The old man was beaten to death.
I don't like this book.
Lucky for him.
What would you ask Tom for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got me some measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was hospitalized.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm looking for.
Are you sure we don't have to schedule this first?
The one who can hear butterflies laugh and the taste of clouds.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't handle them.
They were pulling lots to see who went first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar's not to be able to see you as goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I've just finished my work hours.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have a flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food cools, warm it up in the microwave.
The surface is right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think now is the time to leave.
This guy's a bandit.
Maybe Tom saw it.
Tom's a little lame.
Tom's very immature.
What are they up to?
How is the wolf on a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he was drinking.
I got your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stuck a fork in the can.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom's got a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are kind of mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom's acting a little shaken up.
Are you brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, but you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to turn.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not retaliated.
You're not so young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me so I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do anything about it.
I like this.
Cut your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm really good at that.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom may say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It'll get colder.
What are you drinking?
How it came - so gone.
His legs were broken.
Tom picked up his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The significance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom's on an pilgrimage.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Does Tom bother you?
This is my latest turn.
I haven't been feeling well in two days.
Wormwood is waste, it's too easy.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know what the difference between the mule and the donkey is.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Outing this rain doesn't come to mind.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got Asalan.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day long.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me get this over with.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are some symptoms of mushrooms poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like to watch leprosy porn.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom took care of himself right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already believe.
She wrote her mother a letter.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
The boy was impossible to swim the river.
Tom had arrived early from Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has some charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely got out.
Did they hire you?
Gas leaks.
Tom could see Mary texting.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little dazzled.
Let's do this right.
You can spend a year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most feel that computers will never know how to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and make her feel better - it's considered sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We've wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's a sitter.
You can't do what you think.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I proceed?
You've been breathing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It doesn't happen here.
It's better to be optimistic and fooling yourself than being a pessimist and being right.
The water was light.
Waiting for the traffic lights to change.
The boy kept his mouth shut.
The ship's body is divided into several water-tight parts.
Since you've been cooking, I'm going to wash dishes.
Let's leave this subject behind.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your temper.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Do you get mad at me?" "Well, let's not!"
He's not the shy guy he was anymore.
You're contagion?
Don't make a scene now.
What was told to Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys in groups everywhere, some playing mosques, some dancing, some riding ball, the others riding bikes, or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was filmed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a beautiful gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy is coming from the inside.
Nobody believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He got his head peeled.
We're on our way.
Get your seat back.
What's his name?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom's getting hot.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
I'm having a hard time making new friends.
It's weird how people in tropical areas eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine what the baby wants, because it's pointing at both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is real love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom's got a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my glass.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim was never abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false trail.
Tom fought.
I said it might turn.
I need you to open my door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Can you fix the bathroom?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're having lunch?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her skirt has a scar on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get inside.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one's come with me.
I know Tom will be out of jail then.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you made a list of things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
Not even a bit of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
I'm sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anybody want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Just figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
A burning match in the dark.
How much is that over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What country is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had a burn in my lungs, I was only dipping in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat's happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom's head hurts.
Well, don't.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
You did your best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what Tom has to do.
Mom's buying me a toy.
That's not how I'm gonna risk it.
This house needs repairs.
I'm impressed, Tom.
Tom's a runaway.
Tom's listening.
They want everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the matter?
Is that necessary?
Tom's lagging behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
Maybe it's best if you call them.
Not some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do with this?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
Then we were 18 years old.
I make 13 bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate potatoes.
I guess when I see him with his girlfriend, I guess.
Tom ran away.
Go on with it.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
Is Tom hurt?
You're drunk.
Tom was starting to regret it.
I think you should choose her.
Hold still.
You're a big deal.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you alone.
Blow out your candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom took a harsh look at Mary.
Tom was wearing a driver.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
You ready yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
I've had a lot worse.
Tom tried to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be a bad guy.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one glass.
No one's writing to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with a full mouth.
They've all been controlled.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm only calling to hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car's broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They've been cursing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his father at all.
Tom's not much of a threat.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom was looking around. He wasn't expecting anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to one phone call.
The skiing was actually much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I don't want to get upset.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'm gonna stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill in the form.
I don't imagine a party like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would want to go with us?
The yoga originates in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom oiled his butter toast.
We have a job ahead of us.
I heard him snoring.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the hill.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's gonna be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the issue.
Tom was seemingly used to such problems.
You'll be fine.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely walked there.
Tom's tough.
Let's sing and dance.
After war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translated vices is quite difficult, if you can even say that it is possible.
It's been an aren day.
I bring bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome weakness.
How many clicks do you make a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him just as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body would run for alcohol.
Tom's on fire.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is difficult.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little joint.
I'll make sure we finish this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You push too hard when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't come for you, Tom.
You won first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smokes marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday, she stayed late.
You're disgusting.
Everyone shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
You've given up the plan.
It's not just guessing.
How do we find them?
Maybe it's acting weird.
No one can be saved from death.
It won't help you.
You gave the list to Tom, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom's been in trouble so many times.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Do we need that much?
He was desperate over health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got earache.
Dan got hit by the head with a hammer.
Who gave you such an idea?
What was Tom doing?
In the middle of the night, you must be.
It's not the right time right now.
You don't have alcohol anymore.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom got famous.
This song's stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
Now it's all over.
I tried to get him to come.
What's up, Tom?
Mother's advice would outsmart the friendly.
We have not been saved from danger yet.
Tom's freaking out.
He waits ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him over there.
Monday's the first day, Tuesday the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom immediately.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I've done it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom saw worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to cook pasta.
The hunter went deep into the woods and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay what I have to pay for it.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop screaming!
You're not gonna command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
It's not city.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.
This elephant loves little children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is difficult for her.
Mary put on her lipstick.
She's got a picture.
It's a skillful swim.
Flowers are leaking.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very annoying.
We need more American lengh of Papaba, under an emergency!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared and give up.
Is this place available?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
Doesn't anybody want to sit with you?
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
Tom said Mary had a bad influence.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying from school.
I often heard him play the trumpet’s melody.
The dissatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's a fool.
I think Tom's gonna be here in time.
Hold on to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check if the gas is off.
Would you take part in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the oatmeal.
We can wait.
Tom and I wrote a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer tea coffee.
I wasn't in a hurry.
The mosquitoes enjoy human company.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you get a message to Tom?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom lit the curtain, quite accidentally.
Did Tom talk to you?
It is difficult to understand self - injury if you have never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
Pressure's coming up.
Tom promptly answered Mary’s question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can peace be used in meals?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom's starting to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom got really sick.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't love him.
I'll give Tom what he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's weapon.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid he won't get lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours without stopping.
I got a high-quality.
Did you find anyone to watch the kid?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom just hung up on his voice.
Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not gonna say anything.
It'd be good.
Come on, quick enough on foot.
Tom's very squeamish.
That's what I said.
Tom's got a butler.
Dan got Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's 11 o'clock.
I'm gay.
Tom, think about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man's wrong.
I can't wait to find out what kind of gift Tom has prepared for me.
I've seen it in person.
I want all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're looking for.
Tom's acting pissed off.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
No replacement.
Hypochondriac makes up disease where they're gone.
My sister makes hair on a freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on a bus.
The rainwater evaporates when it's warm.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my hand lamp.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must still be at school.
I never say anything, even if it pisses me off.
You're on his level.
I'm trying to hurt myself.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please clear the room.
Tom is still trying to talk Mary into accepting the job.
How many percent of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me meet Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't wait any longer than five minutes.
If time was running, the radioactivity was dropping.
Should we believe that?
What are you doing so far?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't have to convince him.
Tom's sitting behind Mary at the French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for my computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
Nobody did anything else.
I'm sorry to break in like this.
These books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom deleted the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a good statement.
They must be worried.
I've been transporting it.
That gave me an idea.
The chain of the clock broke.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Let's all go get me.
This is a good parking spot.
I'm going to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I want something new.
Kids need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to protect the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box's empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's have a sledge.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me sick.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil collects in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
It's green.
Tom repented what he told Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom's getting tired.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
They're all sitting down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't feel comfortable walking.
She seems a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're getting started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So, I'm serious.
Forbidden talk during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Don whatever you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank-you note.
They won't come tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Come on!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to eat in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp over.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that was it.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience does not inherit - everyone gets their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
This tissue stretches so much when it washes.
The truth is a goal, not a destination.
I'm hiding him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I ran out of class.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, I'll find it hard to fish.
Tom was taking a nap.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep like an abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him with the kids a little bit more.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a hard critic.
I cured my cold with this cure.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
We were playing basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn the radio on, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I've got a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted the situation cleared up.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll get back to you.
It's not enough on this road to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom did it.
Please do it again.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's licking himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say that Mary Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We've been trying.
But it's cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You got too much work to do.
Is it possible it's Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I'm fighting your courage.
They voted him mayor of Boston.
The police found shoe prints at the crime scene.
I asked the same question.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom kept the letter.
Tom would've wanted that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is, who's gonna tell him?
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come, too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that Sarcasm?
Tom's a twister.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this on my own.
They had a probe on the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't made diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What is the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
You dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd has gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
The time in April is still intact.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom's got two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Accept Tom's advice.
Tom left uneaten food on the plate.
Tom's changing course.
There's no man alive in the classroom.
The rocket's taken off.
We were laughing.
Tom was a little bit of a standoff.
Tom's only here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to look busy so Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I got his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers flow quickly after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I was eating late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
In addition, I can fly.
We're running out of money.
There was hatred among them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I don't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
He and I are friends.
I may admire others, but I've never had anything else to be but who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine if Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't hurt me.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Can you imagine a wish?
Children sometimes fear darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.
Tom here is the only one who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's getting sad.
Fucking hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
That's what I liked about him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them lick.
It's a shame I didn't drive a bike here.
I have to visit Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
Let me be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to overshadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give us a chance.
He suddenly showed up.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's in half-cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You've done a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too many.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is, who decides what should be done.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tape doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this would get bad.
I didn't know if I'd get mad or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at 7:00.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, is he coming to visit us next month?
Marionettes run wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were teasing her for her clothes.
You're gonna get confused.
I won't follow you.
Maybe Tom's already done what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
It was a failure that turned him down.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Beekeepers believe genetically modified plants damage health bees.
You can go now.
They're stalling.
Tom's a second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
Tourists weren't happy.
Tom lost his socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom stutters.
The laws are like cobwebs -- they hunt flies, but they let the axes and the arrows pierce.
You're proud of a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
You left your key to your desk, just like you used to.
He took his fur coat off, went upstairs, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same on this subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was Tom's.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're city.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
Did Tom stay long?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Has anyone seen Tom?
He avoided danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to say it again?
I think you've been spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like it made it easy for you.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful town.
This arm doesn't turn around.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my notice.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Dear of you."
We were very close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
No one defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
We don't have a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me take a breath.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
That's a coincidence.
I'm so glad to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can blame me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you will never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat put her claws in my hand.
"When you fell asleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What were you doing up so late?" "I was talking on the phone with the ex."
How did you get them?
No offense!
I was a little burdened with something else.
His heart was broken by undisturbed love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're disturbing me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
This is where I belong.
You're my friends.
He's a chair by profession.
Tom is not as naive as many people think.
I hit him in a fork.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm taking a lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill in the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really gonna get married.
Everybody turned Tom down.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old coins.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you were saying.
We have to face the facts.
No damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're in no danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them in bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's what I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep driving so he caused a car accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
You like Boston?
Tom was very pissed off.
Why does Tom do that?
I have a job for you.
How is a multitude of names formed?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I got a nasty cold from him.
It's improved.
This world is a valley of tears.

The theory will be handed over to mathematicians.
Where'd this come from?
We're not done.

Is there anything we can do to help him?

I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a clipper.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sorrow in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer is 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I would do anything to earn money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say anything you don't mean.
You're in a beautiful room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's up to.
Just leave Tom behind and get his bucket on.
Our lunar was closing in on the little island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute, my ear's ready, I'm going to give it to you.

I'm ugly.
They're gonna quit me because I'm late for work.
I thought it would be nice to buy you a pair of earrings.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a catch.
Why don't you go see a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
There are no smokers here.
Is the freezer still working for you?

They're my things.

How are we today?
There's your wife.

Remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and a dot!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us do our best.
I'll pay.

I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do it.
Tom's got a little cock.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going to go to the dot.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They were chased.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much it costs?
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were after you.
Let's get down the street.
A living soul wasn't in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I've got a few minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you so much.
Nice cooking.
There's no shorter way to the top, just to the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come dance with me.
I already asked them all.
Automatic cars are now being distributed.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He's gone to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a new novel.
I was waving Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The orgulator was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
His aunt eats apples or bananas?
You're a moron.
She was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making a seagull.
I love blue.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to receive a bribe.
Don't make my coffee.
Tom gave her a stuffed bunny to her daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the game?
They picked her up pretty well.
What does that mean?
I did what I could.
We've got three kids.
I'll give you mine, and I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a debt to me that I spent the night with a smart, spirited and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a wreck.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were texting me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess what?
He's about to drop.
It's a sweat river. It's starting to pour on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just put that on.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you do?
The movies are a great variety.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
The singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they're back.
I'm so scared.
The entire board is against it.
The world lights the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom was building a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
Airport's close by.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger off.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
It's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to keep Mary safe.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom's quiet.
I gave her a fake address.
I lost it.
I'm not going back together anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The coin I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl's got a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom hung up.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's Tom buying?
He looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything is quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Wake up.
I'm having a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You're paying me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether he can or not.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls lower than you.
I have to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost ran into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's out of a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks good.
Has anyone broken your heart?
That's how I feel.
What makes you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd you go, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come on time.
The Germans have a looseer view of the nudity.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a great grave.
Women like men with wrinkles.
Have you forgotten your wallet again?
Do you take a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I didn't get lucky.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The island's settlers are friendly.
Let's try it first with Tom.
I've always liked mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most prominent American songwriters.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom would never come back here again.
Nobody likes whiners.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the far mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do that if I could.
Tom's a freak.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We're the first to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
The sapon burnt my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a quick learner.
We've been eating a lot of beautiful food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
They beat me up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly trash bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where he hid Tom the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's a good memory.
Can we do whatever he wants?
The time has come to say good-bye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room that didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine's a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to know the answer already.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood looted the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who's the master of this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was a great help to us.
What do you usually do at leisure?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a pebble in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked.
Who made the doll?
I haven't lost hope in a moment.
Her long hair was boned brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I'm never looking for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
Taman's on the move.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's wrong with him?
I love someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I'm a French teacher.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone.
I never wear suits.
The lair's broken.
He's gone.
His clients make up mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the difference.
That's terrible.
Why do you mind?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women like men with wrinkles.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname looks perfect on him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
She's ruining her clothes.
You took out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom's on his way.
Tom's acting a little down this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked his butt.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at the bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely bowed down.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's a good writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I'm using an opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a bastard!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's been exploited.
Tom didn't want to bow down.
Tom was suspended.
They laughed.
She'll be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like a marinade and some sea fruit.
I was terrible.
Tom seems a mess.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we'll find some help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're wrong.
He's been working at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
Is anybody surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's getting mad.
It's work.
We'll figure it out.
Commendations encourage students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure that out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom's measured on a scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom lifted his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “lady ” was used only for nobles.
Tom's been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can a man choose just one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I came to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in the heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean up Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
He used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She slipped the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your kid laugh.
Tom suspects Mary and I are slinging something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty grumpy.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunders go down?
Don't mix business and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom's holding his breath.
Tom was busy.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent is unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't make Tom mad.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not quite true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm sick of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as I'm through with him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent one million dollars to the company.
I have a lot more to tell you.
I always write down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it easy.
My son always interrupts me as I speak.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
I guess I drank too much yesterday.
Tom was doing his best.
Tom said he didn't remember the guy's name.
I'll grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have a book to lend me?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just go inside.
He's an exploding steel sword.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When are we gonna see each other?
I promise you I won't do anything that'll hurt you.
Tom is the only one.
The woman calls him the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's getting mad.
I don't even know what that is.
I don't call them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was so generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait in front of the post office.
What college did you learn?
It's about integrity.
Please don't give me your hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
It lasted a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
There was a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
You overdid it!
He's got a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
How do you like it?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a hunch the show will give up; they didn't sell anything much cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom doesn't think he should be using deodorant.
Does Tom often swim?
The girl's asleep.
Go write homework.
Don't force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're for laughs.
Tom paid me.
I'm trying to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted a lot of kids.
Tom's acting kind of silly.
Go to sleep, Tome.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own manners.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I got the impression it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come in by car.
I'm grateful.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one less case than I did, she complained she had too much to wear.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do it right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in orange.
Tom came here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on business trip.
Tom said he'd take the party apart.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
The lightning usually accompanied the thunders.
Tom likes tea with cinnamon.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I go with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom got him on the ground.
This surrender has no end!
The glasses are in the cup well.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to fly with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How come you haven't slept yet?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's unable to do it.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We've both seen him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in tropical areas.
I think I made a good point.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this too good?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw your face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this job.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he can play tennis, but he won't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What's the sign on the door?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way it holds its head remind me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
Here's what we're looking for.
My shoes are on.
Tom would do it back.
She's always worth things.
What country are you a citizen of?
Ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting with Tom.
I prefer cats dogs.
There's still little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been painting her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's not usually a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should've asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
It doesn't hold on to the heat.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you immediately.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have money broken.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it like that.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep working.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you can say.
Can not get message: %s %s
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
Here's what I'm looking for.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're doing it together soon.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yell at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits down for long.
Go with the barns.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin condition.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to go.
Tom can't feel it.
There's more tea in the teapot.
I must've parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism is a religion or philosophy?
The noise was making me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know things.
Was everything just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind.
Everybody laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I'm having sinus trouble.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She skillfully handles a saw.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
They've put the plan in place.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I've made a mistake.
I've got three dicks.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
He slowly recovers from the disease.
I want a turnip.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was plagued with sperm.
Tom is fair.
This is what you should do first.
We met around noon.
I don't want to do anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tome.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?

Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't help it.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use of that.
It's not working yet.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, give me a call.

He has a passive personality.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure in the dust.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you to harass them.
Depends on your decision.
That's workable.

Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.

I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's up.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.

I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
She couldn't take her pants off.
I don't have to convince them.

What do you eat, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.

Why would you do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.

How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mom?

She wants to run.
I need some sea nuts.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.

Tom's always trying to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to understand what he's doing.
Come visit us in the near future.
Have you had breakfast today?
What's this about?

She likes to brag about the magnificent lusts she has in her house.
I'm not a local.
What's in your plate?

You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
She's a good swimmer.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
Don't you get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as it took me to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're sending us.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
Triangles don't have four corners.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom and Mary calculated.
Tom was just listening.
Mary, turn away the lipstick.
I guess you got it.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as the day is over.
Mr. Gorbachev, bring down this wall!
Tom seems surprised.
Tom stood up.
That's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try and get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel good in retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate that right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me back.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?

She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll come with a metro.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom, I'm not exactly his favorite.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will be here.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think about this very carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think of us?
Are you writing these?
It was a great show.
We need to go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night when I was 13 years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
That's what I'm doing for him.
You can trust her.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
I'm just having a hard time.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's mad at each other.
Tom's sleeping.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom's well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.

I'm not armed.
Is that how much you hate them?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a cup of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom's here in time.
It's boring TV today.
Oh, great!
Tom found a baby with four leaves.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got to say hello to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be tested.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds completely valid.
It's the law!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom came safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
There, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on a bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.

Watch out for sparks flying out of the fire.
It's just made up.
Tom kept quiet on Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.

He admitted he had to lie.
Mary picked up all the money for Tom.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom's starting to knock.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work before.
We have everything.
I baked these cookies for him.
When does school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "cao"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These are certainly forgery.

Open up.
Put on your apron.
It's possible you're wrong.

Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about which items to pick up.

Don't worry about me.
We can get some rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's no one in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the mountaintop.
I'll tell you what you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it alone.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my bedtime schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom can be very retaliatory.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom very much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're very brazen.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Daddy really slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.

We're mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack up.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They blew their tent on the beach.
That's not what I wanted at all.
You better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom's acting jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and put another one in that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you back.
She's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows aren't clear at all.
That was very rude of Tom.
It's dead.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I'm angry.
Let them sew you up.
Sequeration is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay good money.
Tom probably went out.
We weren't fighting.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are both heavy and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one has complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot in here.
You let him down.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I don't think I'd understand.
Tom's spineless.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You praised us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a paw.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusheric.
You need to help them.
Tom wasn't crying.
You wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom, turn the hook.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
Nothing is sadder than stupidity and indifference.
They're all aces.
Tom was protesting us.
What are the websites attached to?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate tolls.
I didn't say I did.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
It's been snowing all day.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Would you like to race?
I need tom.
Changes are never easy.
Is Boston far?
They pay me to help you.
This jacket's too small for me.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was at work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard's coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
The Gulabians symbolise peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
He's sleeping in my sleep.
It's not scientifically proven that there's a connection between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a man's product.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Hit this button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
You got the keys?
Tom blew his car off.
You've got to get over the trouble.
Tom wouldn't break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom is cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We're calmed down.
You look distracted.
The bread is roasted in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I can see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please go outside.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have an asshole.
A lot of trees fell down.
Lions don't distinguish colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's messed up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really nice time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote a paragraph from one of those letters.
Tom noticed his wallet was missing.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
It's pus from my right ear.
Card boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts by meals.
We're in real danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These guys didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
What couldn't you sleep from last night?
They've cast a curse on us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
The turtles have long lived.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom's sleeping real tight.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're between friends.
You're getting thin.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is, who's going to make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a hot night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan is actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs from a sub-poly.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would I help him?
Tom lit his shoes.
We've lost faith in mankind.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to do that?
Why do they all hate us?
Tom loaned me some money.
Am I disturbing you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom gets it.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom can't talk to us yet.
They're gonna love that.
I'm a faggot.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
May I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm going after myself.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will apologize at least.
He's getting close to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Did you pay yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom cut his face off.
How do I benefit from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
He burns me when he wears that outfit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.
They believed her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to a wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but I don't do it.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
The dolphins kind of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to get out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to look after his child.
I redefine the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Good luck.
We have to steal.
This is an air test popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for virtues and give up vices.
You're a big old man.
I'm against this project.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could have guessed Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty harmless.
There's writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just watch it.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish up tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often come in at the most awkward time.
This dog is staring at me like he's trying to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and were not real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What were you thinking, Tom?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies when they do.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I've been thinking about it for days.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote to Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
This thing is a monster building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love it!
Is this right in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She has ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger potion.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like what that sounds like.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not inexplicable,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom's back.
Don't repeat yourself.
The worms are wormy.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look pretty good.
You ruined Tom.
Do it.
Tom seemed to resent it.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become both physically and mentally stronger.
She's a lively girl.
If I could stay, I'd stay.
Please stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're on their way.
Do you have a map from Boston?
Don't let it fall in your head.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test.
He was lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was a bit of a showy guy.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
It's my Taman.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm taking Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have a professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two lines.
The principles should draw attention to readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than bow down.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I watched a French film with English translation.
Tom used to make Mary laugh.
Tom's full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says that the child’s illness is false.
Dan had a violent relationship with Linda.
Everyone's back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us.
Maybe Tom could sing at our wedding.
Which one would you choose, Tom?
The hospital's not much there.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I don't piss their dog off.
I didn't sleep right.
I don't want to, and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty at the age of ten to eleven, and boys between the ages of eleven and twelve.
She's on her way.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon rise.
The wall is cold in touch.
He thought someone had put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I can't tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was touched.
It was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
Residents rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day of school.
Don't come back when you get home.
Tom taught me how to sing.
"What book do you read?" "Roman."
Your car's on fire.
It's not a toy, boy!
Half the species are getting married.
They're staring at him.
That's for them.
They're Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do community service to make amends for everything I've done.
Tom tied his cords.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's beautiful.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the axles poisoned?
The kidnappers tied their eyes.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary has provided much support.
Tom's in danger right now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back in place.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I've been waiting outside for you.
I want my money back.
Tom didn't do it.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the canton.
You've seen what I can do.
We've got a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I have a menu?
It's not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom's gone nuts.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's weak in sight.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I had prepared a speech.
The falcons have a sharp look.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was a pain in the ass.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom politely smiled.
Teacone's pretty dirty.
You should get some sleep.
Tom took his weight off.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he had to take care of some things.
How does that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by suffocating her.
The little island from afar looks like a turtle.
Do they bite the trout?
What did Tom ask?
Stop blabbering.
I'm 30 years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't have anyone yet to know how long.
The dog barked him.
Let's go to a movie.
Pretty women age a lot better than beautiful women.

I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom was retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom's unnecessarily picking up a Jaw.
You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking up the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's working out of nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts so bad here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom's been suspended.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'm gonna get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom's never gonna finish the job he started.
Tom is a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You weren't right about the painting.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nicer to each other.
Tom's replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
They're all baggy.
Faith involves hoping for what reason can't be trusted.
Tom used to hang out with me.
Tom wondered why Mary wouldn't help him.
You've ruined your whole life.
I couldn't imagine this world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent to value.
We rented a movie.
The snore's coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick a weapon.
They've chosen a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one dragging himself in the back.
We appreciate our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked for their salary to rise.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten before, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He was gonna say something.
The scratch stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons.
And see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's like a squirm.
That was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The ventilator isn't working.
It's not my fault.
There's nothing I can do.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understand?
My day was full of activity.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father's suffering from a flu.
I'm not waiting very long.
Just look at yourself.
It's beautiful.
It's missing empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
They listened.
Tom went outside.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's pissed off.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They broke it up.
Tom's a big shot.
Are we supposed to put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe in this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm sleepy.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
It's going down like a eel.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the trash in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go pick Tom up and come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take the mask off.
That's another option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm bluffing.
I liked the way you danced.
I need you a little bit.
They lied to us.
Tom is right.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've brought him down.
It's white.
Sit down.
The iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
My shoes are killing me.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to go home on foot in the rain.
It's good to be alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he doesn't have any friends.
Each color has its meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was breathless.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I messed up.
I've been scratched.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
You must be relieved.
They never caught me.
I love my country.
I don't know how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't fuck me up.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They're seen in the mirror.
I don't feel like crying.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks really good.
I need to figure it out.
You two have gone against me!
I've never worn a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids sleep upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't count.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumes Mary caught a fish.
It's boring sitting at home.
It's not that bad.
They're detaching.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
Probably won't be worth waiting.
I have to buy a new drawing for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand it.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What exactly is this about?
I'm not an expert.
My biggest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary took us away from the first day.
Let's have a laugh.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's exactly what Tom did.
"Will you not eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it after."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took his weight off.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real skin and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom's not that tall.
She's wearing a leather belt on the string.
They shut down the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom snuck out on Mary.
I'm gonna go look for them.
Tom came even though it was raining.
I don't want to use dilda. I prefer real dicks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing Sunday.
Tom's been surrounded.
You can only stay quiet.
I want to find out what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything?
He's not fighting.
I expect your help.
Tom's going on his own.
Tom had only fives at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clean.
Tom was talking too much.
My brother's out.
You were great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The dentist built a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
The local politicians have been contacted.
Tom's getting notes.
They gave me this card.
We'll have a discussion about the prognosis.
Everyone's got their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Are we supposed to eat this apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 allowance a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom sewed me up.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you spill wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with a elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us to help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you like robots?
They're losing their mind.
He's really starting me.
I can go where I want to go.
Tom was often abused at school.
When does it start?
The bear bites itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three coffee spoons in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom, calm down.
The rocket's got a hole in his thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's what I doubted.
Tom doesn't do what he has to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe isn't even your friend, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do after that?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'll wash first.
Tom's 30 now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate it.
He became a chukunba just a few days before he was nine-year-old.
Did you ask anywhere?
It's important to have in mind that no one's ever a hundred percent.
He's gesticulating while he's talking.
Sit next to me.
Tom's thrilled.
Tom never gives anyone money on loan.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633, however, because of his age and fragile health, he was allowed to serve that sentence in house arrest.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more often live longer than those who run over a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom cut out the tree.
The land is still watered, it's probably gonna give up the sword.
I had a nap.
What a collection!
Everybody's got names.
Have you ever smoked a cock?
The dog followed me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
He's trying to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's brilliant.
Tom's very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little more red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there silently.
I collect stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
You live here?
The room looks like a pig.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Foucher's work.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Peaches are mild.
That doesn't matter.
I like comic books.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the fool's uncle sat in the living room.
Did I tell you?
Mushunki falls from the tree.
You got a band?
You can wait here.
I got a five in French.
I want the class to keep quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind blows.
It's a risk plan.
How fast do you get from here to the post office?
I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to disguise yourself this year?
I'll do what you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there's an unforgivable act, it's an act to refuse forgiveness.
The door's locked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
He's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember.
Tom noticed Mary watching him.
You're giving me a hard time.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
Eagle is the king of birds.
And then I'll call you.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky is up.
The Galama will wake the baby.
Look at that. Look at that.
That's not exactly something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary are playing rhymes.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom relied on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom thinks he'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't catch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read her Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked in two hours.
He's the one I found out about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on his way.
The long walk called his appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and donut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it's done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Did you study outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom senses danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is a mojo.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
Nobody would care.
Have you written in a diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it for myself?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of jail.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into it now.
Why do you blame me?
Come on, Tom.
I'll try hard to get there in time.
Nobody came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause sickness.
We're almost ready.
Tom has a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not nice to him.
Tom stole your money.
It's not getting out of here.
I helped him raise the table.
I was eating a steak with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to walk down stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith sucks.
I'm sorry I ever said anything to them.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up in two and a half.
Tom's been drinking.
I slept in the pot.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly how it works.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need a envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asian Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first a slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
Fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I made you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many reading books is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
He's got me on the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom's acting a little surprised.
You're losing your youth.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
It's a fleshy smell.
Am I supposed to know you?
Tom skillfully concealed all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't know.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just picked up Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there was no Dane's.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He came ahead of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom put on the table the new fly he had just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's fucked up.
The landscape is too big.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test him.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated victory with wine.
We don't have all week.
I'm gonna try and take a break.
The fall is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to come up.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so great.
Dan was about Linda a very short time.
I can't answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal to dignity and rights, and they are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat each other in the spirit of general humanness.
What got engaged was an accident.
This building has thunderbolts.
They kissed.
I've got a friend.
Tom wants to do everything by himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Supeva's changed.
What aren't you going to pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
Nothing will cost you to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom was staring into the tunnel.
How can you be my friend?
I think it's familiar.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
It's all bounds.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The basil, the pituitary, the rosemary, the teammate and the oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a perceptive man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Not knowing always creates fear.
I don't get paid much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered.
I'm practicing.
She may have lied to you, but she won't have me either!
Let's just get the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick.
Tom gave his hand in the bag and pulled a few coins.
The room was a shopkeeper.
It's just to solve this task.
They must have removed the bullet that was stuck in his spine.
It's so funny.
Does Tom seem upset?
If I may, this weekend.
I know what it probably sounds like.
One of the bags is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your solstice.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
I guess you don't know how it hurts to sting you.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink, and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but here he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy doing his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Well, it doesn't seem like we should be asking Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary out for the turnip.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him makeup.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I get your name and phone number?
Tom was throwing a rock at me.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They stood in front of the store to avoid rain.
I think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
Everyone's getting suspicious.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there's a movie called "The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put his diary in a drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at it.
Tom's got a babob collection.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The mice are plague transporters.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom got cut out.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not predict the fall of the monarchy.
I'm taking it from Tom.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep driving so he caused a car accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom says hello to Mary by waving.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French quite well.
Don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
It'll take us approximately three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would I do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You worry too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweeter.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
Sounds really cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care of yourself, Tom.
Tom tied his cords.
I can't put it out.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
You're really good at this.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
Trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all about the excitement?
Tom's off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an irresponsible fact.
Is it delicious?
Look out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom got a little snooze.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer black.
Tom surrendered to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to God, and Osaka is similar to Madeline.
Have you stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd get it.
The survivors are kind of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I cook soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I will examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the wolf going?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that get engaged.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom came to the next question.
That was considerate.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you to write skillfully.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please unpack the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary this morning.
I'm just doing my honey toast this morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get it back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's excited.
I almost wouldn't be there.
I was making cake.
Look at the number.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hey, how are you?
Last month, I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'll take my weight off.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefits do we have?
I'm just with the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a wonderful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a fast-word.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt that he needed to be redeemed.
It's about them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not even your shoulder.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We don't hang out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is serious.
Mars is the red planet.
He took a dog with a rock.
Tom kept staring.
It's seven o'clock now.
I'm curious.
We can try.
You wrote this book yourself!
Don't put that much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be proud.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with his dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How Can We Help?
To prepare the planting soil, you have to grow it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We can't see.
Mahmud can't take it for nothing.
Nobody's listening to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for it now.
That's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go to a couple.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are gone.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly in your ass.
I agreed.
Tom confessed to spilling red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Laura.
Tom is a hopeless case.
It's a little bit ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help with the search for Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff's here.
Stay as long as he wants.
Take me for cancer only.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very penetrating in his job.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I do daily?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom's kind.
What was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a pie maker.
You've got a lot of piercing eyes.
Doesn't that make sense?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We need to let Tom get back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I'm writing pretty good.
Will you go back to work?
I'll be with you soon enough.
Let's see if you can get in there.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom's rich.
Tom's acting more polite.
Would you like to drink some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
Squares have four corners each.
I kept working.
They've developed addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept quiet.
Get the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary leaned on her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
Nobody was listening to Tom.
Would you like me to pick up something from the supermarket?
The mass is over.
Tom erased the knife blade from the jeans.
Tom was trying to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them turned to me.
I can make that happen.
Do your gums bleed?
Just give me a call, okay?
Tom put his beer pin on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
He gave me a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should stop by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that is possible.
He looked me sharp through the glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he was stalking her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
It's tough.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave quite well.
I'm supposed to let us go.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could break the aquarium?
I've had it over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression over many times of his life.
You want me to take your bags?
I'd trust it to my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's the matter with you?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class's on the move.
There were footsteps of penguins on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called for a laptop.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
For all of us, it's obvious that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom's been doing something wrong.
She's studying Anlician.
With such a lush dream, he'll become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit the chewing gum.
Make it mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easily bad habits are gained!
She's starting to act weird.
Probably won't pay off the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she was born interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are just as strong.
The president looked strong.
What do you want me to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, everything can happen.
You're a small town.
You ran as fast as you could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is broken.
Grab the day.
What's with the bells, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer watch over.
Tom's been running away for hours.
Now it's time to make up for it.
Most virgins have read a hymen.
You can do it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a Communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom's interested in French history.
Because the bus had held back, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll manage.
Is that dog there?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French deeper than he was actually talking.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are on.
That drug calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look like a fool.
His mother's American.
Just relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphincter started circling around him.
We need your help finding her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom fushersky did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked pissed off.
Please tell them what they have to do.
Bacteria is microscopic organisms.
I decide, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works good.
Tom got sick bad.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese from a cow.
We get that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her license.
It was angry.
Pillars cut down a tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini to the end.
Single couples should not be allowed to marry.
The cow forgot she was once a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
The sewing is a manual thing.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister take the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn out the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There is no sign or voice from Tom yet.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other lies.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is reportedly the best disinfectant.
You'll have a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
Get lost.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very useful.
He stood me up.
Did you get an ambulance yet?
It's after lunch. Our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
Red light's turned on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood is circling through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My toe hurts on my right foot.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a what?
Tom's paying attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave a message for her?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the cartoon.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't know English, I know Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
Nobody's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't mean that kind of thing.
There's a wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a hand watch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole crew.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're teasing me.
But not before the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not much of a talker.
You were right, guys.
It happens.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take a train.
I'm sure you can handle it.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you mocking me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a painful task.
You need to get him to listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom's been calling Mary a lot.
Thank you, dear.
They have increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must have already known about it.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
I've been looking all over for them.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It went red.
I have to go.
He who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big deal.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe it'll come tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom hung a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mom doing?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him in your name.
Don't tell my mom.
You can avoid such problems if you have these counsel in mind.
His speech is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Just bend your stuff.
Where did you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back before the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't have to be there for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
I've had my headache.
I don't like that word.
The Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The time here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't be so bad.
Isn't that unusual?
I fell off a wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom must be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom waved the scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was standing in the middle of ruins.
Tom's a big materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Pass me the pliers.
The hashs love cold weather.
This is a little loose in my ass.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Did you forgive me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not tired.
She's afraid she won't lose any money.
Tom swallowed the beer.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his father very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing something.
Tom went well today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret Tom doesn't agree with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
Now this is your house.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing just what I want.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there were no charges.
The lust is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary's about to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They soared seed, and grew it, and reaped it; the watery river was overheated.
He feels hate for his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom was in an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I ski a lot.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm qualified as Tom.
When will my turn come?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a printed error.
It's not often that somebody buys a $1,000 hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan made the assistants laugh with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely got away from getting caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom came back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's going to make up for the stench?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
I don't mind here.
You tricked me.
It's about the heating.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
Actually, no one knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're banging her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I acted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat at restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
Looks like you've got an infection.
I can't think of anything better.
The sky is red in twilight.
I came to wish you good luck.
It would be a pleasure to have you here, too.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I don't speak English.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this very well.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
The room was quiet.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's warm here in hell.
I've seen it through.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
He's studying here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
Kids, stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
Beautiful!
The palace has a tower high.
The kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
First you have to ask them.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom came here alone.

Go wake Mary up.
You almost missed it.
I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like someone he's scared of?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you for who you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was compromised.
I wish I hadn't.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anybody want to help us?
It's a tight hole.
You should go help him.
You enjoy that?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring presents like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long does the road last?
I'm good, thanks!
Don't be late for tomorrow's meeting.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom's raised.
I'm surprised that Tom went with Mary.
He's blind from birth.
The book contains 15 lifespanses.
Tom's been working all night.
Tom was just here.
I quit.
How long have you been waiting?
The soups and shoes are new.
I haven't eaten pizza lately.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
Tom's buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
He died of an overdose with sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know that Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do anything that will remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a slaughtered man.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
It's raining.
Yash, goofball!
They kicked in the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't even come home last night.
I think we've had enough.
This is very difficult for them.
Witches don't cry.
Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom seems indignant.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can carry you.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm insisting.
I'm sure Tom's gonna do it like this.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to get him back.
You're rude.
Are you sporting something?
It just sounds boring.
Get him inside.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom never said he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
People in Madrid are crazy.
That's totally incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very social.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I practice just to look nice when I'm naked.
A thousand years make up a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I plan on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
It's an honest word.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you present yourself in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Get your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a bit of a shame.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crossword puzzles.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
So don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a kid.
Tom's not a naughty guy.
He never hired them.
I want cakes.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm gonna go hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents ’ home.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.

I'll take you home.

The answer to both questions is no.
They're amazing.
The legend says she was a siren.
I really miss my mom cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I'm used to speaking in public.

Tom's out of jail.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for the green light.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
He got on my head.
I took my head off.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going over.
I'm gonna go change.
He hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find me a title.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, I'm gonna get my movie shot.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but it could never have happened here.
Tom was hot in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.

Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom always makes me angry.
Tom's just looking.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom, don't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're in no hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It was raining two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The horse's hooves have calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my right name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda used to wear modest dresses all the time.
Did you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He's outsmarted his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask for Tom's permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They did.
How many cups of coffee a day are too many?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would've done the same in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling around.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
May I gather a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times as much as I do.
I cried one.
Write down the date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary couldn't come to our party.
Just try to find him.
Tom put his coat in his closet.
I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do it.
Is this your bag?
Most of all, it will help her sleep.
This is Nina, your niece.
I'll wash the dishes.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
It's been so intense lately, but it doesn't even see the slightest result.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not sure.
That's no longer necessary.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary wandered.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamt of becoming a nurse.
Tom has obsessive compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You've got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for coming by.
I'm just as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
Dan had her drunk last night in a meatbath.
I'm in.
Do you need a cut?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen the rainbow.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just smile on and on.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary get away from prison.
Tom doesn't have any tea.
I'm tired.
But that's no argument!
Tom got a pie.
What can I tell the kids now?
Let Tom go.
I've been over the shock.
That's a good system.
I don't remember Tom this high.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom's starting to shoot.
How was your vacation?
At that time, we were just a few people among a group of gorillas.
She started to stick her fingers in the hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
Are you traveling too much?
Have you told Tom about the pains in your back?
That's what they all do.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom's collecting stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water shines in the sun.
And it's a crowd of members B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's generally known that you're not fond of Tom.
I'd be happier if you came back three of you out.
What's stopping you?
Tom's got skinny lips.
The kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom does the violin for at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
Camello Tom had more time for me.
I long for him.
Tom had a bad day.
Grandmother's death was a great shock.
Your car's on fire.
She's been able to learn how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the strength to go when it comes to practice.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is rushum.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this much food?
This is one of Boston's most popular restaurants.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to me.
Tom and Mary seem perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask for money.
The more things I have, the more I have to clean.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to rub cream against the sun.
Was it hard for you?
The voice was barely listening to Tom.
Don't be silly.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna be?
We're gonna have to reroute.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom will wait.
I'm trying to get you down.
The real story differs slightly from what you said.
It was your mistake.
The balloon was slowing down.
Who likes insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Make three steps so jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom's starting to laugh.
Is that why you're here?
You don't have a head start, do you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to.
It worked.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big deal.
We need something to keep our mind off our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Secure the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid was crying and crying for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom is nothing like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you excited?
Tom couldn't have done it on his own.
You're a wise man.
Nobody went there.
Let me introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie in eight pieces.
Maybe you'll need it.
I have chest pain.
Unable to untie the boot.
Give me my money back.
First you have to show yourself.
My father is a silent man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new hand watch.
It doesn't seem very different.
You've been through it.
Tom made Mary's room on the bench.
We're banging him.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.
Did you arrest her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your statement is about right.
I don't know anybody like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still heating up.
Tom and Mary got out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the gems last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom is your teacher.
I already packed.
Since when do you feel the fetus's movements?
I can't do it on my own.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
Nobody's getting fired.
There's no one else.
On my way to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom's got the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one paying the bills has the right to be mastered.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me a mess.
When will you visit us?
There are tragedies every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can take mine.
Tom won't like it.
All comments are unnecessary.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them some help?
Tom threw his mouth out.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not mistaken.
The patient has suffered from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
No gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems insulted.
We know him.
I've been there for hours.
Tom had a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did you get up early, Tom this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's loud in here.
What can be done?
I guess you found it.
Don't take it literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm gonna go and do it.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
Snow is a deep one rate.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby bit the bell.
Now I'm going to go look for Tom.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This is going to work for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly what happened.
It's not like you were wrong.
Tom, listen to me right now.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
There's no life without anxiety.
You've got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me an idiot.
I'm very attracted to you.
What's for dinner?
Open on page nine.
Tom opened his jacket.
Tom was beaten.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like the wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We had a fight.
Did Tom eat grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a gift.
I'm not completely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
I guess you're right.
He got away so he wouldn't get caught.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom hasn't returned yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to dance with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
We need to set up a trap.
Tom's parking, he'll be right over.
Love me a little, love me a long time.
Tom's in the living room watching cartoons with the kids.
There's no answer for everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his own stories about what had happened.
He was in mud next to his knees.
You told Tom about it, right?
Tom's calling Mary.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you panic?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom is resourceful.
He's a real man.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We'll turn around.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are equal, that's, after all, good news, because it means not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The aim of the interpunctional signs is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to.
Will you come to Boston with us next year?
Why are you hesitating?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom wondered if Mary had already woken up.
Would you like us to take you home?
That house is made of bricks.
We didn't bring any conclusions.
Tom came around 2:30.
It doesn't sound like who knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got cat floods.
The crowd clapped.
I'm letting the kids grow up on the stripes.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We've been bribed.
I was too tired to go on.
It's all sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's on his forehead.
I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson last night.
Can this page be used in a similar way to Twitter?
It shouldn't be too difficult to complete the report by 2:30.
Tom's been doing it for a while.
Heteronormality is in a tight relationship with sexism.
She's got a novel.
Are these your bags?
Why do you study English?
Have you already left Tom?
Tom must have made himself important.
Tom's still at home.
This movie is worth watching.
My breasts are growing.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
Dan's back in London.
My father bought me a digital handheld for my birthday.
You know me too well.
Tom's human.
Don't you feel lonely?
Did you make coffee?
Don't look so much like that.
Get up when you talk to me.
He's always happy.
The forest was very peaceful.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's grumpy.
Most of the clothes worn by Europeans are manufactured outside Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can look online.
When I was younger, I always traveled by highway.
I couldn't determine exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
You're so negative.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here for them?
When I'm pissing, there's something like a pus.
You beat her.
The stars showed up.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your own private army.
I often play volleyball.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
That'll teach them in turn.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom snore.
We're ready to fight.
I suggest you listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.
Tom was hired.
It's been a really fast time.
There's no way out.
Last night’s heavy rain made efforts to save survivors from the devastation.
My wife's hiding something from me.
What can we offer our guests?
Tom's pissed off.
Look at the number.
There must be a key.
Half the apple.
All balls are yellow.
I've got a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Get on the couch.
Did they hit anyone?
The factory's making toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What were you singing?
I can figure it out myself.
The room has a view of the ocean.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like cattle.
There was water all over the kitchen floor.
Cancer is a great enemy of mankind.
He's still on sale.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
I would occasionally have passed by a carriage.
Tom put the gun down.
There's no theoretical chance of doing my job one day.
You almost fell for terror.
Suddenly I felt old.
They're pissing me off.
He was having a nightcap.
I'm ready.
You killed him to avenge his late father.
Tom took a cookie.
I've been studying French since I was 13 years old.
Men don't really differ that much from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite facial cleansing oils and skin cultivation.
I'm sick of French.
I don't care if she has twenty girls.
The bull's got balls.
Tom's on foot.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't understand.
Born in 1960.
Can I have one?
Baburs are usually mild in taste.
I'm upset.
It's possible it's raining today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash up.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're up to to to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and keep her.
Wouldn't you start picking hair on that?
How will you escape?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you gonna do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd love to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these men from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
She's in great condition.
I grabbed Tom for a elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far away from here?
I can't die here.
Tom, listen.
I think I've made a mistake.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look made up.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You're not sleeping all night, are you?
He's doing everything.
The noise will awaken the baby.
I'm late for spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the double with Mary watching TV.
We don't mind.
I think I should've asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
Nice to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I don't usually get to work on Monday.
I was a fool to believe.
Tom may need a little help.
They went to worship every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.
There's a crowd in the bar.
He's got the idea.
Tom was more and more wondering.
Who gave them that kind of money?
We have to buy them a gift.
When did the war end?
Did you work the dishes machine?
Tom is a married man.
Like Tom said, this soup's changed.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come out?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Are we supposed to use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You're gonna have to learn more next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There's algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
Nobody likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should've asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than meet your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom's got two places.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like the most.
Your transgressions have defiled the graves of your ancestors.
Don't be discouraged now.
It looks like her style.
I've had enough of fighting.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a journalist.
Sarah has 31 pens.
This is very confusing.
I'm bringing some terrible news.
If possible, I would just like to experience the kind of bitter love that I love most of all once again.
I saw Tom in the area.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom's got the movie.
It's a stupid rule.
Did Tom offer this?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his homework?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We're all eager to watch the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.
We broke up our conversation.
I'm training.
Cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
You can't focus on your academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They've become addicted.
I just want the money.
I'm not saying things about their kids again.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've been completely healed.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly did Tom get hurt?
Was he compassionate?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't read.
Is there sugar?
Dan and Linda finally moved to London.
She suddenly fainted.
You looked funny.
Tom's playing in the band.
We live together now.
You've been busy.
I'm sorry, isn't it a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship has changed its course.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I don't intend to explain anything.
April-li-li-li!
Tom used to say that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I was.
I think you're gonna have some work to do.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-wing.
Can I take a picture with or without a flash?
He and his sisters had ice cream while the radio was on.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem alone.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's a grown-up now.
We don't sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I'm back on the bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The fight seems to be nearing the end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's a mess.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up at the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you write anything?
Let's do it now, and it's over.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mom put your collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you'll be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin our party.
I can do that.
I'm not discriminating.
I'll go if Tom goes.
We'll be back in a month.
It is advisable to check if you can have any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the prescription medicine.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I crashed.
I like swimming.
It was her.
We can talk to Tom.
I assumed it was free.
You're gonna need help.
Do I need a lawyer?
We need to get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom's starting to climb.
Tom really likes you.
Tom rang Mary.
This is the first time I've ever put a pepper on my balls.
I'll handle it.
The cure worked.
Tom can play the guitar.
Who broke it?
The ambulance's short.
I'm sick of Tom.
I like you so much.
I want to take you somewhere I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't remember buying this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, you lazy bastard!
How long ago?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd be avoiding Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I've failed you.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one really loves us.
It's very rare.
I'm not good at this.
Tom's got a little candy.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
Everything is ready.
She's unscheduled.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Wipe yourself.
Are you done yet?
Tom's listening.
Can anybody hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
It's been hard on us.
Cut your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be in a chain.
I'd like to go alone a lot more.
It was them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital and he's recovering from what he's overdosed from.
He cracked the walnut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were getting ready to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible Tom did this?
She didn't hit him, she hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's a face.
When you're on a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this isn't even the right time or the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom is untrustworthy.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the lid on the toilet up.
That's good training.
This chair is kind of like this.
I should have refused.
I had to consider what might have happened.
That was my tactic.
I've lived here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I've got to buy flowers for my libe.
I know you've done your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of his notebook cover.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should feel sorry for them.
I don't appreciate it.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is just a cannon.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make sure.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a brief silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom swears too much.
Nobody walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with this plan.
Righteousness is expressed by works.
I don't know if you know or not, but here in America is expected to tip the waiter.
That kind of behavior was his brat.
I'm walking with her.
That would be all right.
Sorry about last night.
Go away while you still can.
Tom was a little awkward around Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the wagons.
I was kidnapped.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea is delicious.
We're on the same plane.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom's very strict with himself.
She's a nerd.
Lemonade's cold.
The lamp was swinging back and forth.
Tom seems insecure.
There's nothing else to look for.
Tom's a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Will you wait a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the fallout in the square.
Hasn't anyone informed you that you don't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
It fell out of the tree.
Tom told Mary he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everybody hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was in the middle of the night.
Don't expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good stuff and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom will drift.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I've been bitten.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at a man.
Watch Tom.
They look familiar.
We've got work to do.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Contact her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom was deeply interested in art history.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you sleep for a while?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new to town, and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
He had a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're worried enough.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems worried.
I'm worried about him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom's acting shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's compassionate.
Make it brief, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've handled it.
This isn't anybody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It must have been made somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with pool, barbecue, soccer field and pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was teasing his sister.
We should've given up earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom's being polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been wasted.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom let the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're close to the solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You're allowed to come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar contradictions: one was sincere and trusted and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't swear.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
I'm not gonna mess it up.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at the butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two breeds in the Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed talking on the phone.
These are great.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was a pastor.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a crook.
Where did Tom work?
I need to carry them over at night.
The noise made the whole city miserable.
A flower-loving person can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They got close.
You're mean.
Did you pass the note to Tom?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was fighting.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing an attack on clothes.
Tom was barefoot.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about that.
Women don't love you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I went to bed, I had three cold pills.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom acts like a spoiled derish.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we have to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to make any conclusions, and second of all, your argument was based on a invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience is seemingly bored.
I grow goods.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mom had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got the wrinkles.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom also participate?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and rejected.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom doesn't see you anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
When I passed by her car, I didn't recognize her.
Is this all it's possible to have?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's just.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle of the floor.
Tom forgot.
Ask him to join us.
It will not be easy to do so without great help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave her a sedative.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, that's what's gonna happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser flushes hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home I could go back to.
I'm on my own here.
It's to protect you.
He's always been helping me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Get married!
First of all, be kind to older ones.
The gem includes aquamarine, ametist, emerald, quartz, and rubine.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother for permission.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've had enough of that chicken.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
A quick lunch.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that no one else could remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
From all the languages I had learned, my French was the easiest.
Tom wrote homework.
I count to 200.
Watch this.
Should I go?
A guy looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We have fried geese with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project isn't going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom's pointing to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily ashamed.
Is everything in there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do what's right for me.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I stepped in something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful link.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He extorted a large amount of money from her.
Can you help me solve this?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make webs.
You really talk a lot.
It's possible it's too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what they say.
He's in love with head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom a pain-resistance.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're sick!
It seems to me to be the only possible conclusion.
Sometimes people ask me what I'm gonna do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound died.
Who's got you in the middle of something?
I don't understand it for myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how palm trees are planted.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom getting in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom wasn't picking up.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try calling her.
It was a great day.
It was a beautiful evening.
I think I might be sneezing.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your handler.
What's our status?
Do you want me to watch it?
You're a real man.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's in charge?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink the water.
Nobody talks.
What did you think to contact them?
There's nothing you can do.
Do you have anything?
It's not a little cold.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently than before.
They're supposed to be okay.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom is hopeless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You've already done that.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want them to invite me.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red frame around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
You were snoring.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He's got a lot of music going on.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say he'd start his party?
This was obviously Tom's tough decision.
Maybe Tom would be happy with Mary.
Dan was doing his job very well.
My legs still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I passed out.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to everything.
I used to hear you.
Stop right where they are.
Are you her subject?
"She likes music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber sewed it up.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
Her sister injected the flu.
Have you tried talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom hasn't stayed here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a cliff while he was cleaning his swings.
Do you have anything to add, Tome?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's going to be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, I'll have my birthday on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's making pushups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to a cave?
Dan didn't want to go to an orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel that he needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought it was coming to me.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one's here.
How much does Tom owe you?
Are you Vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing looks like a drunk madman anymore.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking off his clothes.
I know Tom times.
She looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate with all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This cure will relieve the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't that wait?
They'll pay for their superiority.
Dan didn't miss a single episode of that soap.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom went well.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you help.
I heard it.
We're investigating the whole area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom said I'd like to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
We'll be right here.
Why do they do that?
I studied college for four years, and had nothing but a poor degree.
This is priceless.
Would you like to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, only ashes remained.
Tom likes all the vegetables except cabbage.
Try putting yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up for it.
People can't create miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to turn him off from their company.
Those who mix verbic endings with the "-thes" and "thes" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened after that?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're all over the place.
I didn't count on it.
I was stupid.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom caught him cleaning up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom found two tubes.
He was lying in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't give us a good first impression.
Please stay inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively to Spanish sentences throughout the month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You earned something.
It's really gross.
You want some cheese?
They say blue tomatoes contain many nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is all wise and pious.
I'll hand it over to Tom.
I don't think I can pass the test.
I think we're gonna join.
Tom's moving forward.
Tom's holding his car well.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people on earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I don't.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm all set.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going shopping.
I'm here to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What is it?
Can people really be so brilliant as to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks a Caucasus language that has neither common backgrounds nor common letters with English, can completely overcome English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There are too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the madman.
Tom was laughing.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Every student has their own cabinet.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom is right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is difficult.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to get rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Take care of this mess.
Blood flows on blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom wondered how good Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I'm singing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I'm very fond of learning French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned the hard way.
You showed my friends the forgery.
I give my workers the right to leave early.
Are you alone here?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
Cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
Excuse me.
What kind of books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm full.
He was eating a kell salad.
I'm going running.
Tom's something chewing gum.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom never visited Boston.
It's good to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and take a look.
Do you think you're decent?
Innocentness is often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's pulse's up.
There's a restaurant around here, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept prying about how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, courageous, and I don't know what yet.
Have you lied to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You were busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I got embarrassed by the heteronormal propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't take it much longer.
The virtues are in themselves a reward.
It all makes sense.
I'll open your door.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were doing.
I don't know how to act here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom unheardly nodded.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's wrong with me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candle is very difficult.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
It's very sleepy.
Yesterday, I prepared a mushroom oven.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!
Although the rainworm also owns a male and female reproductive system, it requires another individual to be fertilized.
The failure shamed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom passed out.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm going that way right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is assumed that the sun’s surface temperature is approximately 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit [6,000 ° C].
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd is gone.
Tom's starting to work.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover him.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to look into it.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't believe her.
It's possible Tom went.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did Tom want to eat?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom got turned down.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's 10 o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know a lot about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was so bad.
This must be yours.
Taman, we're on time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are blooming for grown-ups.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
Cavaler would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was unmistakable.
This is beautiful.
Tom, don't make fun of Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I would say no.
Nobody deserves to die.
Then I didn't know what that meant.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Fortunately, this asshole is stable, otherwise the storm last night would have knocked her down.
I heard they caught her.
Tom's got everything written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who are you working for these days?
I'll give up.
Mary was delighted with her eyes.
It's bad to swear.
I've only got one minute.
Tom never quits.
I think Tom's conservative.
How good are you guys?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm sick of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making herself mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom tricked us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom won't come with us.
Tom's only gonna tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The seller tricked him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a fine.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where would Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me a cup of tea.
It's just a job.
I hear he has a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came over to talk to her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing Daddy's new version.
Everything seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn't know how to play basketball at all.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to have asked me to give a speech.
Tom doesn't like it for sports.
I'm busy, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Call your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I'd love to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor after the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom got me a cab.
He did wonders.
The glands produce chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
This is a new model.
I gave her some help.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
Nice to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get over here!
You could have refused.
Why wouldn't you let me help?
It's gonna happen soon.
Hey, it's stuffy in here.
It'll happen what happens.
I heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to tie Dan into the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was being decent.
I guess I'm gonna have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay, whatever you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak more loud?
Where's the meeting going?
Let's play "Truth or Challenge".
His conclusions were based on unprovoked assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom's starting to read the book.
That's the right reason.
Tom loves flowers.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song for me.
I don't want you putting yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long have you been in front of a computer?
My wife's getting sick of the daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amebs are single-cell organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom bended my arm.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today is tougher.
I'm cold.
He was walking in front of me.
Give me that back.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
It's possible someone was following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in his purse.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He left recently.
The kids were so excited about the party that they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll make it to the station on time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her adopter.
An international language would be very useful to mankind.
I gave them some help.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't fool me at all.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
You can't just leave a baby.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom started eating.
She's kind.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Do you like soda?
Tom winked to the girls.
We did a hell of a job.
Tom's acting different today.
Throw them off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different distinctions.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The monks used to play tennis at the convents.
Don't be so perverted!
Tom wants evidence.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your salary.
Excuse me, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got a little sledgehammer.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The trial involved mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom's laundering money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
So didn't you say you could swim?
He's not putting pressure on Tom.
They betrayed me.
And the paper's gone.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
You should attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of you giving a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He was eating lamb creams, potatoes and mushrooms soup for dinner.
We were waiting for them outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not exactly an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is heavy.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor's looking into the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke rises in the air.
The printer's not working.
I'll walk you to the door.
It's dark here.
Tom's a scoundrel.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We could order a pizza.
Tom's doing a lot better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary was representing her team in the competition.
Tom doesn't want a party.
Looks like an egg.
I just want to see Tom.
I'm the only one.
We don't want any more accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'm gonna kill you.
Most people resist getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I've been watching Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you getting so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be understood in oils and motor-butters.
How was yesterday?
You have to study hard.
We can't just fire them.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm tearing my omelet.
Tom explained to Mary the rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You're sick, aren't you?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question has remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I took out my knife.
They danced.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed in ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy ran next to me.
Tom now seems very tired.
I'll follow your instructions.
I built it.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic units of living things.
They're slowing her down.
I should go and change.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died to us one day after the birth of my older sister.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom quickly lost himself in the crowd.
Just so you know, I don't care.
No, I'm still a bookkeeper.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
Don't surprise me.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sex transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you care when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally smiled.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I've totally misjudged her.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was getting ready to shoot me.
Tom's snoring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can get him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the semir.
It's not too soon.
Are we supposed to eat?
They painted frames from the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I messed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
Everything or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird lifted up the twig with beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to take time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was trying to get rid of it.
What do they want me to be?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time right now.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It lasted a lot more than I thought it would last.
Tom ran by Mary.
I was scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Was there a bathing suit?
His nose is his best choice.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom's got the tidal hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's so cool.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
It's just a simple question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I'm having a bad conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
The frogs are wonderful creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do it.
Tom was drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
That's a lot of work.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should've asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I give you respect.
Be merciful.
Follow the others.
Before I fall asleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was that a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth at every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom mustered the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's trusted adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I gonna get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one's going to get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a hand watch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name on the list.
Tom noticed Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed his job.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom may be able to start your car.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to my face.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to wash.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom had done it.
If I ignore him, he's gone.
It'd only bother Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it very well.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach so they ran the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on alert.
He's a little deaf, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's about you.
That's a very dry explanation.
Walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It is too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom's got his shirt on all over the place.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, okay?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiple is communal, and sharing is not.
I'm having a bit of fun.
Tom took off his hat and bowed down.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom snived out loud.
It was Beter.
Tom's starting to snore.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all point to her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was out of his mind.
This lemon is empty.
There's grapes in the cooler.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to be the first to hear about Tom?
Tom's relaxing his arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam clouded my glasses.
So, no no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the alve flag?
Get better!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom took no food for a week.
I don't really understand you.
Though I'm a God-fearing man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there any problem I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
They're not that angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
She deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We have to investigate something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How's your chest?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met at the meana.
How did Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Night life is better in New York.
Please come in.
The cure must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not taken.
I guess it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I've fallen to blame.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I made you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't rot.
Tom's regained consciousness.
Tom made Mary angry.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good at it.
Tom may be here today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom doesn't have the power of will.
Will you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I came by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, already.
You better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom's acting sad.
I've been home all night.
We got out of there at 11 o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston so much.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a raise.
He found someone to talk, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I already wrote my part of the report.
I don't think they have a cure for it yet.
Every member must attend.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
Looks like it's not helping.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my bag of golf equipment?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
It's my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'm going to Tom's.
Did he buy Tom presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What's luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You scratched your clavicle while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blinding.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was a bit of a pain in the ass.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I could cook something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom as a hill.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve on it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time for closure.
Leave him to me.
The stone ran down the hill.
She went on a hairdresser.
Tom's been crazy for a while.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't hurt his heart.
You don't have to comment.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is very cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look stupefyed.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave home after paprikas.
I think Tom's a creidac.
The pain of a terrible infection and the ovary leaked.
I don't need advice.
This isn't worth it.
It's not coming to mind.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He used to act weird.
We'd hang them.
It's probably not a good time for this right now.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're powerful.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake some cranberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him now.
Hold on to the topic.
She really wants to talk.
I've got questions on the tones.
This is a funny, funny, even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language looks different in the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pyjamas.
This way.
This is a holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where'd you find it?
This was on top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we got out.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's too hot for a demequare?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Do you get a crush on him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are they collecting in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You cut your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little enchanted.
