Wells’ Assembly members worry that “they look like beads ”
Some members of the Assembly are dismayed with their proposal to change their name to the HR (members of the Government Parliament).
This proposal is being provoked by plans to change the name of the "Parliamen of Wales" Assembly.
Members of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this may become a cause for ridicule.
One of the Labourists turned out to be worried about his group’s new name being “smart with Tape and Vdub. ”
For readers outside Wales: Well, in Welsh this certainly has an offensive meaning.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group is "not happy" and has offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party pointed out that his group "is not prejudiced" to the change of name, but notes that the new title of HR (in English-MWP) has a certain verbal opportunity with a "compatt".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is spoken in a similar way to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up the draft bill to change the name, issued the following statement: “Of course the final decision on all the descriptive names called members of the Assembly will belong to the members themselves.”
The Law on the Government of Wales since 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals establishing broad support for the Assembly to begin to be called ‘Parliament of Wales’.
As far as its members are concerned, the Commission prefers ‘members of the Wells Parliament, briefly ‘the TEU’, but the ‘HR’ option has received the greatest support since the consultation with the public.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching the consensus obviously will be a headache for President Elin Jones, from which he is expected to submit the draft bill for change within a few weeks.
The Reformation Bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the comedian system design itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when the bill is discussed.
Macedonians to vote in referendum whether to change name of state
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve a continuing decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called ‘Macedonia’.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is the opponent of the referendum on the change of the name of the state, ruled that you will not hold the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St Martin's Bells are silent against the difficulties of the Churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was some bar and church literally on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today they both disappeared."
Adams says that missing bars is understandable.
"People today are socialised in different ways," he added.
"Wars are no longer the neighborhood daily, where everyone gathers regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same position".
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments, where people live who do not help survive the rest of the neighborhood's sanctuary.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the closure process for these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them".
Both churches were built by white traps before Harlem became the neighborhood of the blacks – the Metropolis Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The original white methodist flock was carried out over the years after 1930.
Then the building became a possession of the black people in the neighborhood.
St Martin was taken over by black Christians under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organised a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they didn't want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's parishioners made up a plan for her restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, is proud to call them "the poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural Treasure" and "an unchangeable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Nguy of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merieweather mentions that from St Martin they never replaced him.
What has been played in St Martin in the last few weeks has been a complicated story, made up of architects and performers, some brought up by the world leaders of the church and others by the Episcopean Empire.
From the newsroom – which is the governing body of the congregation, consisting of world leaders – wrote to the parish in July, expressing their concerns that the parish "will be willing to transfer the cost of the newsaria", although it did not have a role in hiring architects and performers sent by the eparchy.
Some parishioners have complained of the lack of transparency by the eparchy.
A 13-year-old kid was hurt by a shark in a California lobster hunt.
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, representative authorities reported.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammal shared before KSWB-TV in San Diego that he hung out with friends about half an hour a Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and flew in along with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then he realized how he was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got to the boy, he realized that the whole area of his clavicle was torn apart.
"I've called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" Hamul adds.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was taken into critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior, Captain Larry Giles, was made on a media briefing that several weeks earlier a shark was spotted in the water, but it was estimated not to be of a dangerous kind.
Giles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
The responsible authorities have closed access to the Ponto beach line in Casablanca to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours of safety considerations while the investigation is ongoing.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans offensive on the state-of-the-art market for beauty products
Sainsbury is facing Boots, Super Other and Debenhams by opening beauty stands in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK’s beauty market, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to increase while selling fashion and household products decrease, the largest places for beauty products will be located in 11 stores throughout the country, and then, in the success of the initiative, such ones will be discovered in more objects.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the released space on the moors, until recently occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of products offered for up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also going to get more space, like the offers in the Boots stores.
The supermarket also replays its boutique range of makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger users.
In addition, the perfumer Fragrance Shop will test discounts in two shops of Sainsbury, the first of which opened in Croyden, southern London last week, while the second will be discovered in Seli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and shifting focus on buying smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, chief executive of Sainsbury, shared that the objects would look more and more like universal stores while the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounters by offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury has Argos sites in hundreds of stores, and they also open Habitats sites since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims to have increased food sales and made the benefits even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to re-assess its beauty and pharmaceutical products objects failed.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute to distribute profits from the sites of the pharmaceutical company in supermarkets.
The new strategy has been developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 objects to Celisio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, executive director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have formed the type and character of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands offered by us aims to respond to every taste and all needed in a pleasant setting with a comfortable location, making this combination an attractive destination for beauty products, which challenges the concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "naked" after Holly Wilbby's refusal of a deal for 11 million pounds.
Dragons Dan Peter Jones' star has been ‘been up’ since TV leader Holly Wilby gave up a deal for 11 million pounds with his Lafasteel company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilbby doesn't have time for the brand household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Goop's Guinette Poltrow brand.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced her resignation in Instagram.
Holly Wilbby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to kick" after withdrawing from their income business with the last-minute finisher brand – while focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones has become “became awake” when the “Golden Girl” of TV has recognised during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that its new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will be no time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is based on the Goop brand of Guinette Poltrow, and the rumors are that it has doubled the wealth of Wilbuy, the value of which is forecasted at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Wilbuy announced in Instagram her leaving Truly, Jones left Britain by plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
Its long-term commitment was expected to provide its future in the next few decades.
Her decision to leave is completely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at Marlowe headquarters that's full of waiting to sell products."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of this morning, which is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to delays in the marketing trade mark.
Last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilbby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Kappa for ten years.
Wilbuy himself founded Truly along with Cap in 2016, such as Jones, who was 52, joined as chairman of the company in March.
The two families often take vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV company.
Wilbby will become an M&S 's ambassador' and will also replace Anne McParlin as the leader of the "I'm a celebrity" show on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business deeds. ”
Heavy negotiations, leading to "heating up relations"
He joked about the criticisms that he would take from the news channels for commenting that someone would consider "unsuitable for the president" and as too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his joke "novinar" way.
"I didn't give up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first took place in Singapore in June and was declared Trump "a major step towards removing North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the talks on the removal of this weapon are on hold.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's Red Jung Ho announced to the representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocal treatment" by the United States towards the country's first steps on the road to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a far more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed for a war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy wonderful relationships."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim led to positive results - termination of rocket tests, release of hostages and return to the home of US military personnel.
He also defended his non-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of us.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island and lead to hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok by foreign NGOs, there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, requiring the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases an unequivocal opinion is expressed that there is no international assistance that makes things slightly challenging," said Mrs. Sembang.
While Save the Children, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the territory of the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, announced that Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to recovery efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains so unprepared for this kind of natural disasters.
Although there were shelters built in Achech in the case of tsunamis, they are not common views on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters even more complicated this logistics.
Until recently stationed in Lombok for the service of the victims of the earthquake a hospital vessel headed to Palu, but it would be at least three days before it could reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned the improvement of Indonesia's lagging infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign by investing a large amount of funds in roads and railway lines.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joko is back in the mornings next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturge brought late equality to Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Supreme League against Chelsea with goal at 89 minutes this Saturday at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturge received a submission from Jardan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was behind 1-0.
He set the ball on his left leg, then set a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penal field and set to the top right corner of the network.
She transferred the impostor Kepa Arisabaga and poured himself into the net unsavourable.
"I tried to take a good position to control the ball because players like Shak are always looking for submissions in front positions, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible for a good shot to the door," Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the instigator Cante, I pushed the ball and I just shot myself without making a big deal of thought."
Chelsea led 1-0 into 25 minutes after the goal of his Belgian star, En Azar.
The "sons" attacker submitted a fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field towards the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic exchanged fast double entry in the center.

Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the League of Europe at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of fatalities from the tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths following the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia is rising to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people have been trapped among the ruins of buildings, collapsed after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves of up to 20 feet, reports agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with over 380 000 inhabitants, is found in ruins of sunken buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation into a murder was launched after a woman's body was discovered in Berkenhead this morning.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue became the latest memorial hit by "rescripting history"
Its ban would be poetic justice for his almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
Ala "Cromwell Society" described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "test for rewritten history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell until the Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconomation of the English civil war has not been ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikcroft is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiany of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Kromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course, in his case, it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognized person, representing one side of the present division.
His achievements as lord protector also deserve recognition and honor."
Pig-killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man identified only by his last name as Yuan was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a dead end on the Liupanschui market in Guayzhou Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig has been prepared to inject with his pigs for 30 May 2005 in Sinin from Cinhai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Juan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found the door to the neighbor's horse open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a blood clot in the hemorrhage.
The forensic expertise confirmed that the 550-fund pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reported.
"My cousin's foot was bled and disfigured," says cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Eventing News.
The security camera footage shows how Yuan goes to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The life-killer didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Eventing News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that Juan's family and market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Although rare, it has been reported before about pigs that attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a wife and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, after a man was attacked with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, this 650-funk pig has impaled a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife can drive him away.
After an orgonist farmer has been eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “slow”.
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little kids, extremely curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
But a man should treat them with respect," the man ends.
The weakening Hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and spilling rains in the southwestern United States
According to weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cool waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and southwest United States.
The rose includes winds of 85 miles an hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane as at 5 a.m. Sunday morning Eastern time and is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugania, Mexico.
Sunday, Rosa is expected to move north.
During that time, over the Pacific, I began to form a synchronisation that is moving east to the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the tropical moisture deep into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some regions of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synchronization will create frequent heavy rains in southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, carry debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to rainfalls from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when a threat of tropical rains arises.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to raised dust and windwriters.
The approaching synchronization will lead to heavy rains in some parts on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to get to rains of over half an inch, which will lead to small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying with them tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area in late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations to the United States, while the Arctic Ocean cools down, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes it leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moe, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to expand and expand.
In most of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October, and from the southern plains to parts of the northeast are expected to dominate temperatures of about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the attractive maturity of the testimony of the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanau and Christine Blakey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s.
During that time, political opposition continued, and the networks interrupted their regular reverse programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizon Senator Jeff Flake, and according to which the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that she was convinced 100% that Cavanaugh was playing drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his devoid of emotional testimony, is absolutely positive that such a thing has not happened.
It is likely even more than the Nielsen figure reported by 20.4 million viewers watched Friday’s testimony.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no directly available data on other networks that broadcast hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also traditionally experiencing difficulties in measuring the number of people who look from their jobs.
For comparison, we're talking about an audience similar to the size of a championship football game or the Hollywood Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first of all networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, it was reported by Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to the Nielsen CBS reported 3,1 million, NBC – 2,94 million, MSNB – 2,89 million and CNN – 2,52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flack was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After a statement came out of the office of the moderate Republican that he would vote in favour of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras shot him on Friday as protesters were trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judiciary Commission.
During all the harassment for several minutes, he did not lift his eyes off the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he represents the truth to the state?
“You have power, while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Flack replied that his office had already issued a statement, and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would make an additional statement during the commission hearing.
Cables and broadcast networks provided a seamless coverage of live several hours later when the Judiciary Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the full Senate for voting.
Al-Flake said he would only do this if he was certain that the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, which the opposition democrats insist on.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the senator of the Party of Democrats Chris Kuns.
After talking to Queens and several senators, Flack made a decision.
His election was certainly essential, since it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "political entertainment" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political events" with the future of Britain and in undermining national interests in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published by her on the first page of the paper, her previous Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack against her so-called "Last Game Plan" for Brexit, saying that collecting customs fees from the UK for the EU is "full absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for the death of the player from LSU
The police arrested a suspect in the final shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in prison on second degree murder charges, Police Department in Baton Rouge reported.
The officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, saying the police had lost their glasses during the fight.
The officers found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on it, reported by the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to a fatal shot at Wade.
His guarantee has been set at $350,000, to be notified by Advocate.
The Justice Office of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, indicating a gunshot wound affecting the head and door as the cause of death.
The government has expressed its gratitude to the Brazilian state police's search for fugitives, the police criminal lab, the Southern University police and local residents for the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6-foot tall and 6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average in the last season he reached 5.6 points and 2.6 rickshaws.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "sinity" and "shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "it's something that bothers a man all the time".
Vulcan spreads ash over Mexico City
The ashes thrown out by the volcano Pocatepet reached the southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The national disaster prevention centre has warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity has increased and 183 gas and ash disposals have been registered in the last 24 hours.
The center has observed numerous tremors and tremors.
Posted in social media photos show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have seen an increase in volcano activity, which is located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shakes central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors of independence clashed with gendarme, when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmes, began to target peace-holders with eggs and paint powder, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, who usually frown with tourists.
Later in the day, other contacts with police arose, as policemen resorted to their thumbs to master the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups cried out, "We do not forget, we do not forgive," while those who declared to preserve the country's integrity returned with "Spain Forever".
The local press said that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical attention for minor injuries.
The tension remained high in the desired independence region even a year after a referendum on October 1st was considered illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalonians.
The overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, although activity was low, as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in voting sections in the region with a number of violent clashes.
The demanding independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to go on a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer gives hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"The past year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy when they could vote, but now it looks like we're on hold," added the man.
Despite the important victory noted, it was a small difference, in the regional elections in the last December, the supporters of Catalonia's independence political parties have been experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in a self-installment or are arrested pending a trial because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pyug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on his phone to support the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that "it's getting harder and harder".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested pending a preliminary process from last year, announced that he will run in the elections for the European Parliament next year.
He argues that "my candidate for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repressions that we observe by the Spanish government".
Londoners: Men arrested after a car drove into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after several times a car crashed into a house in Londoners.
The incident took place in Balllynard Crescent Thursday around 19:30 British time.

It's also possible that the car was shot with an crossbow.
Goal on Menga brings Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured victory
The winner at the High League Livingston surprised Rangers and caused only a second loss to Stephen Gerard in his first 18 matches as the manager of the Aybrox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team leveled up on points with the second in Hibrenian ranking.
Gerard's team remains without winning a foreign field in the High League in this season, and next Sunday faces the leader Harts, from which he is eight points behind in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without losing in the championship, and the manager Holt hasn't felt the taste of loss since he switched to Kenny Miller's office last month.
Livingston missed good chances against the unemployed guests.
Holt's team had to lead the result far before it scored goal, and his direct style of play extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried his defenses, but his blow went further, and Alan Litgou shot at the beam after Craig Halcket returned the ball with his head to him.
The hostesses let Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously hinder the guests from static positions.
And that's how you got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed an infringement, and Livingston played well, like Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined with each other and carried out the Menga, who led his ball and pointed out from the middle of the penal field.
So far, the Rangers ruled the ball more, but they faced the impenetrable protection of the hosts, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to interfere.
This game style continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morlos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
The Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's foot, and Littlelow's head hit the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingston's penal area, however, the centres were raining, which were easily cleaned, and the judge twice disregarded the claim of the guests for the penalty – first after the fight between Halquet and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then suspected of handplay.
Liningston’s “Fenominal” – Analysis
Eladeir Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great score for Livingston.
The team plays simply excellent, continuing to overcome expectations and improve its performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost didn't make any changes after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserved a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halquet was amazing, organizing protection in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warll under pressure constantly.
At the same time the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrate some great things, but in this case they were a lot under these standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, only once they managed to break up the protection of the hosts – this loss must awaken the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the heads of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct the relationship between NATO allies.
A friendly relationship cools down because of problems affecting human rights, freedom of media and admission of Turkey into the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, police prevented a 25-thousand mob from gathering in front of the mosque, but still, there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds also raised a vote, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to allow it in the country.
The various protests reflect a breakdown caused by one visitor, who is considered a hero of some German Turks and at the same time despised as the despot of others.

We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we very clearly state that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended."
Long Latin prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be treated in a hospital after an attack on a prisoner.
Also in October last year, policemen from the riot squad were called to jail to master a heavy burden, under which personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens by lightning flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to be struck by a tropical storm, but there is a high probability that this is exactly what happens early next week, while the weakening hurricane rose is taking place in the desert of the southwest, leading with it a risk of flash floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against lightning floods Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finisk on Tuesday, with rain coming in late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “from 1950 until now only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center envisioned 2 to 4 inches rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Sea, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, and in separate places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rosa may actually be a blessing, since the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious, some of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest is currently in land.
According to the U.S. Land monitoring Commission, slightly over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least an excessive drought, which is the second weighting category,"weather.com reported.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to reaching land at the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which on Sunday morning can still boast at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Evgonia, Mexico, moving north of 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets colder waters over the Pacific and is therefore weakening.
It is therefore expected to reach land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to significant risks of overcoming.
‘Finish rains are expected from 6 inches to northwestern Sonora from Baha California, up to 10 inches,’ weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
‘The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, Northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States’, warning from the National Centre of Hurricane.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening lightning floods and carrying various waste streams in the deserts, as well as lands in the mountainous terrains.

Trump says Cavanaugh "is hurt by the guilt and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Cavanau is a voice that rejects the corrupting and unfavourable tactics of the democratic party," Trump announced at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Cavanaugh was "damaged by the guilt and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh testified in front of Congress Thursday by strongly rejecting Christine Blakey Ford's indictment for a sexual assault from decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution.
The president made a statement Saturday that "the American people today witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kavanau.
"Every vote in favour of Judge Cavanau is a vote in favour of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," the president told a gathering of Western Virginia supporters.
The president is indirectly referring to Kavanau's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
"Leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, in fact I am also involved," Trump continued.
"I am therefore going around and fighting to support good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats had set themselves up for a mission "to prevent and prevent".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanau's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, as a member of the High Representative of the Republican Party told CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken away by a soft coastal giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when the coast was swept from waves up to six feet (18 m), took many to their death and destroyed everything in their way.
The Tsunami hit after an earthquake of 7,5.
"When the threat of tsunamis rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, for which many became a victim of the disaster," said during a briefing at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokeswoman of the Agency for Overcoming Indonesian BNPB.
"The water was dragged along by cars, trees, whole houses, defeated everything along its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape from the water," he added.
Nearly 16 700 people were evacuated to the 24th center in Palu.
Posted by the crash agency photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, broken and twisted bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosque.
The second tremors continued to rock the coastal city during Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was met in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than that released on Hiroshima nuclear bomb during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damages as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been broken down.
The bodies of some victims were found under the ruins of the wrecked buildings, added the speaker, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damages could be higher on the coast 300 km (90 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the trous.
He also added that "Communications have been cut completely and has no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross pointed out that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already headed for the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticised for not being informed of the defeat of Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement of the message.
Shared in social media videos show a man upstairs screaming at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes on the coast and covers both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the clip in due time.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe disruption of electricity, which has stopped communications around Palu, and thus made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the assistance of Jackart and other cities, responsible authorities said, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other first-need products.
The city's airport has been re-opened only for rescue operations efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palli on Sunday.
The people who died in Indonesia's tsunamis are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While the employees of the World Vision of Donggal have managed to reach Palu safely, where they found refuge in the birch shelters scattered in the courtyard of their office, they have passed a series of scenes of devastation, says Mr. Dosebba.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite work on emergency and rescue operations, some complain that foreign saviors are prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, the financing, sending of staff and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The threat is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but that is where they have not yet declared such a status."
While the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who are still unknown, they continue to hope for a miracle and that their relatives are somehow survivors of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandono, coach of Indonesia's national paraplannerism team, has trained two of the missing paraplanners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in a hotel “Roa-Roa” were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the paraplannerism field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon reminded us of how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa Hotel had reached the paraplannerism community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who had participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue cards, however, the only answer to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think this means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
Thieves pick up 26 750 dollars during charging an ATM in Newport to Levi
On Friday morning, thieves raised 26,750 dollars from a Brink official who loaded an ATM in Newport to Levi, became clear from a press release to the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptyed the ATM at the amusement complex and was getting ready to load it with money, wrote Detective Dennis Makrati in the announcement.
While the man was busy, another man “feel neared running behind a Brink employee’s back and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses noticed many suspects running from the scene, the message continued, but police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
Anyone with information on the identity of suspects should contact the Newport police on telephone 859-292-3680.
Canie West: Rapper Changes Ye's Name
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Yee.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “A man officially known as Canie West.”
West, 41, has been wearing the nickname Yeh for some time, and has been using it as a title for its eighth album, which was published in June.
The change beats his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons", the creator of the show tells us.
In addition to being the redundancy of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance to him.
I believe that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means ‘you’ or ‘you’, said West earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the Radio-leading Big Boy.
"This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed by Cannier, which means only one person, simply to Ye, which is a reflection of the good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
Rapper is one of many known in his sphere, who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, among which Puff Dadi, P Dedi or Deedi, but this year announced his preferences for Lion and Brother Lion's aliases.
One of West, Jay Zee's previous co-workers was also presented in a version with or without indents and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico president vows not to use the civilian army
New Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force, and this happened as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, on Tlatelko Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while student movements with left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador gave an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and finding more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
US needs to double financing for II development
At a point where China is becoming more and more active on the front of developing artificial intelligence, the United States must double its research budget in this area, claims the researcher and developer of the II Kai-Fu Loy who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various branches from the U.S. government made statements on the subject of the I.I., although the US generally does not have a formal strategy for the I.I.
During that time China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 innovation in the II until 2030.
"Development of the budget for developing the II will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and are about to make further breakthroughs with regard to II," says Lee.
The doubling of funding can also double the chances of the next major II achievement coming from the United States, as Lee informs CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of the II: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Hoaughton Miscourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest II companies in China – Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melon Lee University, he worked on an IT system that beat America's most successful suit player, then being executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee due the previous technological competitions of the federal government, such as the robotics competition of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when will be the next one that will help recognize the new visionaries.
"The US investigators often have to work hard to get funding from the government," Leigh specified.
"Not China takes away academic leaders, but corporations," the man said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on II.
Lee also argues that the changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its I.I. programme.
"I believe that doctors in the I.I.S. should automatically offer green cards," the man said.
The State Council of the United States announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence by the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions like the way the National Science Foundation and other state organisations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee specified.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and academic environments, and announced the formation of a Special Committee on artificial intelligence from the White House.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in developing the II.
In the meantime, the US legislator, who wanted to establish a National Security Committee on artificial intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change their state's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the name of the state to change to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. It is a move that would resolve a continuing decades of dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where Macedonia exists, argues its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity, thus imposing a veto on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on a new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a campaign to boycott him casts a shadow of whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of its validity.
The issue of newsletters reads as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying in order to achieve the entry of the formed after the breakup of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old Skopje citizen.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have ruled that they will comply with the result from it to the extent that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two-thirds of the parliamentary representatives must therefore vote.
The State Election Commission said by 1 afternoon there were no reports of irregularities.
However, voting activity was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the urns.
"I have come to vote for my children's sake, our place is in Europe," said Giose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorrica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament Vladimir Kavadarkov on 54th prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tents engulfed by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly lifted heads, not through the service hatch," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country can be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he cast his own vote.
The State Secretary also said that the positive result will lead to "confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a study that said between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum – which is under the required activity.
Another study, the work of Macedonian TV Telma, announced that 57% of the responders plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them 70% said they will vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow against pro-Western government policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire Brighton defense and marks goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling crossed Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City 2-0 victory to Manchester State on Saturday in Manchester, England.
Aguero's play for his goal at 65 minutes seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine golmeister was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball into the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He sneaked past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest on the border of Brighton's penal field.
Then he went left to Stirling.
The English striker, with one touch, returned the ball back to Aguero, who, with a right foot hit the doorman of Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions at his feet," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We planned for him to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal right now."
But Stirling was the one who provided the original advance of the “heavens” in this match from the Supreme League of England.
He signed in 29 minutes.
In the situation of the goal of Aguero, he received a deep deposit in half of Brighton.
He immediately released a passing pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Stirling with the pass of the distant beam.
The attacker of the skyscrapers was able to narrow down just before the ball went into an outpost.
City will face Hofenheim in a match from the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon of Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play down Rockies' fate
After the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is no particular sense in another game of a title-starting pitcher.
Yet always the ambitious Sherzer hopes to be the title of Sunday against Colorado Rockies if the game is important for Rockies who lead with a match to Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed to participate at least in the Wild Card match after a 5-2 win against Nationals Friday night, but it is still not sure that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win maybe the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss such a game?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are supposed to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Schercer this would be the 34th game as a starter pitcher this year, while he held a workout Thursday and he would have the normal time to rest until Sunday.
Washington's right-hand pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strategists in 220 2/3 innings during this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation with his chosen Supreme Court member Brett Cavanaugh while speaking of the importance of Republic's votes in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in current history – I also declare that although I am not a candidate, I am actually also involved, which is why I am fighting with all the forces for the right bids," Trump said.
Then he continued with “You all see this horrifying radical group of democrats, seeing them with your eyes.
They're determined to regain power in any way, you're the witness of their unhappiness, of wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to get involved in power and government, because they're only interested in power and government, but we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, according to the president, have set a goal "to prevent and prevent".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling democrats "fragile, nasty, mean and unfaithful".
The president reminded of the Senate Judiciary Commission, mentioning demo senator Diane Feinstein indemnity, which caused strong crowd whistles.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was a really bad sign – perhaps the worst I've ever seen."
The Leiberians are no longer widened.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of the Labour Parliament so far, to whom it was stated that he was not welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude as he firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship has criticised me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironic similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed in the time of previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting announcement said on Friday that “we want meetings to include everyone and be fruitful. ”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, Friday's meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and promises of “blower and moderate” politics have long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It was increasingly obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of how much the party's leadership liked.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader while the colleagues I had worked for before thought they shared similar political views began to expect me to make a turnaround and to take up positions I would never agree with – whether on the national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I'm actually saying – there's a whole insulting tyranny in social networks, where it's called for a denial, a rejection of moderate policy, claims that I don't belong to Labour.
Like this, it's not just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I even got more luck from some of my colleagues, because the comments about me are at least political.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of these colleagues who face sexist or racist smoldering every day without fear of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this age in politics is how such attempts have turned into normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that Labourists should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widened, with any sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming narrower and narrower.
In the last two years, I have received a number of advice to keep my mouth shut, not to speak so much, and that then “all will be well. ”
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labourers 32 years ago, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need them – either as a local advisor or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way of my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state is moving towards Brexit, this will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But truly my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labourists, or not: For me, it is a pride to serve you and I promise that no threat of denial or political separation will refuse me to act in the way that I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air led to the ranking
The two late essays may have changed the light final results, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match by Tennet's Supreme League.
The team is already heading the ranking, and the only of the ten teams is without loss until now.
The better defense and better use of opportunities proved to be decisive in the match than coach Peter Merci and his team could be very pleased.
"I am happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past games, but we are still without loss," said Morchi.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Ear greetings really took advantage of their positions better than we did.”
The essay of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional blow to Frazier Klimo, took Air forward in the result, but a yellow card to the Scottish National Rory Hughes, released to play in the Warers game, allowed Melrose to catch up with the result after Jason Baghet realised an essay followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
Klimo increased the ancestral for Air shortly before the half-time, marking the essay after the solo action, and then realizing the additional blow, thus making the result 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and the essay of Patrick Anderson, followed by a successful further blow by the Bag, reduced the front to just five points.
Then continued stopping the game due to a severe injury to Ruarid Nott, which was put on the stretcher, and following the renewal of the game Air increased their advance after the fall of Staffor McDoual and a successful additional blow to Airmo.
Then Aer Blair McFerson's acting captain got the yellow card and Melrose took advantage of their numbering advantage once again, with heavy pressure and carried out an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failure of an additional blow.
However, the hosts returned their presence to the spirit, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after breaking down Climo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal act of McFerson performed an essay using Air's advanced offensive line.
Climate realized the extra blow, not after long did it again after Kyle Roe caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and took Gregor Henry's wing on the fifth essay of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to be heading for a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the popular broadcast of BBC, which is also a writer and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last for the show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiggang.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan had planned to participate in Glasgow's "golding restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": the lack of water on the sea of Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors keep patrolling the shacks with a blizzard in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying over public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are hung with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by law.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost hatch passed to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – and the call to sail again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope has been strongest for decades now, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the international court on October 1st, after five years of consideration have already passed.
"The force is in Bolivia, everywhere senses wisdom and unity, as the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the trial of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to go to a disputed battle for re-election next year, has also bet a lot and a lot on the court's judgment Monday.
"We are very close to getting our access to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility that the court will make a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it were to judge in its favour, it would not change things in reality.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to take over Chile's territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the latest arguments points out that the case is ‘not complex’, refutes Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have actually hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean was scattered by the current Bolivian government," Zarate said.
And then he suggested that Morales's warrior rhetoric had wiped out, and Chile's little remaining good will remained.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold a normal dialogue after what happened.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Previous President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court ruling was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile", as well as a chance to "severe 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides".
Calzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the problem of access to the ocean as a "political duck".
"The Bolivia will never give up its right to go out on the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it will not continue with nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States of America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented her speech Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting between the heads of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the edge to start a new unprecedented diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Ri called the "empty hope" the idea that continuing with US sanctions and objections for a declaration that would end the Korean war would make the North fall on their knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without giving Pyongyang the first to make a significant gesture on the way of disarmament.
Like Kim, the President of the United States Donald Trump wants a second date.
But there is widespread scepticism that the Pyongyangs are serious about their rejection of arsenic, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the last scream on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sunlight, you don't need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that waved the fashion platform during the Fashion Week in Paris.
A lot of impractical hats caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, as designers sent their creations to their eyes to sweep the fashion community.
Valentino's exploding proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a wide periphery similar to that that that literally absorbed the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included jewels of dunes, a magic hat, and even pineapples – but they do not aim to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewn lips and visited not so much for the higher fashion as for Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a diving equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice creamflake.
If you're into similar fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after the "La bomb" – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on the heads of everyone – from Riana to Emily Rataykovski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat, which has taken over social networks, has led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion floor – a straw beach bag, much as the wearer wearing a swimsuit.
The perfume bag with the color of overheated orange, shaving with a white leather handle, was the attractive all-seeing item in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jachems during the Fashion Week in Paris.
The celebrity composer Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Association (SCIS), strive to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their career chosen and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can draw up and implement a personal learning programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in understanding his language, your words get to him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved high grade A.
The data collected by 74 members of the SCIS Schools showed that 72% of students achieved a Chinese A rating of 72% of the students studied in German, 69% of French and 63% of the students in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently languages as an object of free choice by students receive the same treatment as natural mathematical disciplines (technological, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) in programmes of independent schools and beyond.
A study conducted by the UK Employment and Labour Skills Commission in 2014 showed that the reasons for employers to find employees made it difficult to find employees, 17% pointed to insufficient language competences.
Therefore, the increasing rule of foreign languages becomes mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which turns these skills into a major globalized world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future once he has the same skill that remains for life.
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling several languages a man a breast before competition.
According to a survey by YouGov, more than 4000 UK residents in 2013 75% did not have a foreign language well enough to be able to carry out a language, the French was the only language whose rule reached a two-digit percentage of 15%.
That is why the investment in language learning today is important to children now.
Managing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from language taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in the future plan of 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country that requires that this be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with a variety and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien only faire.

LeBron will make his debut for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are excited to see LeBron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the first match of the pre-season training team against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it hasn't been specified how many minutes he'll play in the fight.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," said Walton jokes through Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel announced in Tweeter that James would probably play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games from Lakers' pre-season preparation.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies this evening in Wilding, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned rally, which includes stops in popular places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the confirmation vote on his election to fill the free seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are threatened by a loss of control over Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump's rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wilding, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, Eastern time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Whiting, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to review the hearings of this week on the Supreme Court nominations Bret Kavano, in which tension arises due to allegations of immoral sexual acts, which retains the Senate's affirmative vote within a week while an investigation by the FBI is under way.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
This is why President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallies next week are aimed at "activation of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and at the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so essential to his programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and we begin a campaign season full of commitments," a spokesman for Trump's campaign said.
This evening's rally, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could lead supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the media's attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump's second visit to West Virginia -- the state, which won by more than 40% in 2016 -- will take place on Saturday.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrishi, who is lagging behind in the social studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi the fact that the president came to give him a boost in the sociological studies," said Simon Heather, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Rader Beach" 2018: The US team will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without the intricate "foursom" matches in the Sunday afternoon, they may have brought what Ryder Expensive.
The change in sport's advantage is a rather subjective concept in which players, however, believe unreservedly, even more in races like this.
So which team is in a better position right now?
"They ran six points and now they're only four, so I guess we've got a little momentum," Jordan Spit said at the end of today's racing day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage at only twelve more for distribution.
However, as Speed says, the Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge by the sports form of Split and Justin Thomas who played together all day long and each of them took three of four possible points.
Spit shows an excellent form from the start to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
The cumbersome responses of the fans became stronger as he advanced in the round, in which with a precise blow he leveled the result in the fourth match, after along with Thomas fell two strokes after the first two holes.
His blow, which won them at the 15th hole, was met with strong responsible reactions, which make us believe that it's really not all lost to the American team.
"It is important not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," said Spit.
That's all these players need now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points from Street and Thomas in the last two days are Frances Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undeniable Rajder Drag characters so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe, won four out of four, and they seem to get it all.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make Gods on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "godgies" on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way it seemed to pass energy between them and enthusiastic fans, have confirmed that they are players who will win Sunday and there will be no better couple than Flitwood and Molinari, who will bring the potential victory of Europe, while the sun sets above "Le Golf National".
Preferably both of them in different holes at the same time.
The stories of European fame, however, turned out to be a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the Fourball match from the morning, while he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "dables" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and Swede into problems that they failed to deal with.
In Sunday games, however, there is no way someone else can solve your problems.
Fourbol and Foursom matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice that they exchange, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
The Europeans were playing better together, and that is why they raised a significant lead before the last day, but this "foursom" session showed that the US team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the US, had strongly doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Expensive.
Europe will have a solid advantage before the last day of Raider Beach, after leading the United States 10-6 after playing the Fourbol formats and Foursum on Saturday.
The inspiring duet, Tommy Flitwood and France's Molinari, began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their asset to the Le Golf National competition rose to four points.
In an attempt to regain a trophy that lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning "fourbol" games against the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and in the end, Europe won the series with 3-1 wins.
The U.S. proved more resistance in the Foursom matches, where they won two victories, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points of single on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first New Year's in Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as "Moliwood", after this sensational weekend became only the second couple who won four points of their first four matches in the history of Ryder Beach.
After Woods and Patrick Reed were in the Fourball match, they were extremely motivated to defeat the Woods Sloms and US rookie Bryson Deambo with an even more categorical score of 5 & 4.
Woods, who barely went through his two games on Saturday, only from time to time demonstrated the bursts of his genius, but so far, there are 19 losses from 29 matches in Fourbol and Foursom matches, and a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning Fourball matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the Foursom clash in the 2-1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copca, respectively, number one and number three in the world.
However, Europe's team has failed to enjoy a fully pleasant, cold and cloudless day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, returned the Americans' hopes by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a tough victory with 2§1 against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the Fourball games, and later they returned to defeat Polter and Rory Macilroy with 4-3 at the Foursum meetings, even though they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Expensive has happened to catch up with four counts of deficit before the singles, and according to Furic's regulation, the trophies will hold the trophy even at equality.
However, after two consecutive days have been overtaken, their chances of a turn Sunday seem not particularly high.
North Korea says "there's no way" to disarm one-sidedly, without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the UN on Saturday that ongoing sanctions deepen distrust with the United States and there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
In the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong-hoo said that ‘significant measures of goodwill’ have been taken over the last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear testing site and promising not to distribute nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances there is no way that we will be first disarmed unilaterally."
While Rhea expressed North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "set" nuclear weapon removal, in which North Korea will be rewarded, as it has taken stepwise measures, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim pledged to work for the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump provided security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking an official end to the 1950–1953 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists "first we remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even object to "the end of war declaration", Ri said.
"The understanding that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is the pointless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem is, however, that ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Re did not mention whether a second meeting was planned between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier in the UN week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-In over the last five months and added: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a standstill.
However, the tone of Rhesus's speech was considerably different from the previous year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States is inevitable, after "the evil president" Trump called Kim "a man-arm" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the UN's Trump, who threatened North Korea with "complete destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there is still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in a bid to stop the financing of the DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri in the culinarys of the UN General Assembly and then said he would again visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of making “ganster demands. ”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to destroy a missile facility and nuclear complex if the US is to take "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that "the appropriate measures" to which he sought are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to overcome the growing culture of learning "all night" with caffeine.
The lecturer found that students at university number one in the world often do not even think when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at a hospital in Brigham and a women's hospital, prepared the course he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came to me and said, ‘ Why are they telling me this only now, in my last year? ’
She said that no one ever spoke to her about the importance of sleep that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to the students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dorm, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the routine of sleeping.
In another part of the participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke," said Prof. Kaiser.
The culture of pride of "teaching all night" still exists, he says, and added that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring a sufficient and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid gaining weight, as the deprivement of sleep puts the brain in the hunger regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaiser prepare the course by taking one of his first classes in Harvard.
He says that his course “opened his eyes ” and inspired him to spread it to the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all students to complete such a learning programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaiser recommends that students think about setting the alarm to bed and wake up and know the harmful effects of the "son light" radiated by electronic screens and LED lighting that can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: A goal of Menga broke Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerard's unprecedented team and brought a 1-0 victory for Livingston.
Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory as a triumphal guest in February with 4-1 over St. John's, but Gary Holt's team had only caused the second defeat of Gerard in his 18th match as a manager, which left his team with eight points less than the torn Harts team, a leader in the High League of Ladbrokes.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the devoid of constructive ideas team of Rangers at no time seemed close to the level.
After the Rangers game, they crawled into sixth place, and Livingston was already third, leaving the second Hibernan behind only in the nude difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems, as the side judge Calum Spence received a head wound after being struck with an object that was obviously thrown by the fans of the guests.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that ravaged Air in the semifinals of the Scotland League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same Livingston's solitaire that pulled a point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team mated all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in rare cases when they owned it.
They had to mark at the second minute when Menga took a touch of Scott Pittman against the goalkeeper Alan MacGregor, but the half-protective missed a good chance.
Later the centre of Keegan Jacobs from foul found Captain Craig Halcket, but his partner in defense Alan Litgou turned the ball away from the rear beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morlos definitely believed there should be a penalty at 15 minutes when he confronted Stephen Lawles, but the newspaper Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian claim.
Rangers had only two precise strokes in the first half, but the former goalkeeper from Aybrox Liam Kelly was able to handle the hit easily with the head of Lassana Coulibali and the weak shot of these Ejaria.
Although Livy's strike at 34 was surprising in view of the possession of the ball, it was totally deserved.
Rangers again failed to handle the deep centralization of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who coolly passed it to Menga for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift nearly immediately resulted in the result when the wing handed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force the guests to play in a comfortable game style, such as Litgou and Halquet repeatedly stopped the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team was able to increase its lead in the last few minutes, but MacGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' stroke, and with the follow-up cord Litgou shot head-on over the beam.
The one entering the Glen Middleton reserve from the Rangers asked for a penalty at the end of the fight after the battle with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Anniversary: Geiger counter inventor
Page of our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BRRONE... the day on which the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hance" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger is developing a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Krahgang Stone in Science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a masterstone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film The Coronado Chambers took part in which seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans took part.
Man: “What is this, for God’s sake?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, e.g. uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated from the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "It certainly shoots right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 only days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.

Then they can “see” protein that is common to many cancers and re-inject in the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who trained the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear in more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory so that they can “see” protein in general for many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Belize, Maryland: “Results suggest we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzophski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “training” their direction towards cancer cells has been used in treating the type of leukaemia.
Kenny West delivered a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat bearing the inscription “Let’s do America great again,” while participating in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was played at the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a senseless performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat bearing the inscription “Let’s do America great again,” he declared himself against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people, and they ask me, ‘ How can you like Trump, he’s racist? ’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star mocked Bret Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission on Applications for Sexual Violence, made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not released, West's record of performance was uploaded to social networks by the comedy Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was placed behind the scenes.
I was told: “Don’t go out with that hat. ”
I've been tortured!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship? ” saying that you will wear Superman’s suit because it means you cannot tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
Comments caused at least twice the crowd whistles and members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Williety said, one of them said, "The entire studio has gone silent."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of "Perier".
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest of yours, that you were made to the end of the war.”
However, the head of the current show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "was himself and it's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a man (as I buy his music or his clothing or support his 'art'), which I think welcomes and distributes an ideology that is worthy of society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name, and now "he is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Dedi, Puffie and P.D.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was Snoop Lyon, and the music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.

The prosecution will be examined by the prosecution.
Igran A Throne Star Keith Harriington Against Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harrington is famous for the role of the swinging sword, John Snow, in the full of violent medieval fentasy series of NGO "The Game of Thrones".
But the actor who is 31 went against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying showing such roles on the screen leads young people often to think that they should be "sirious" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner at Rose Leslie's Throne Game, also 31, acknowledges that she feels "very confident" that this problem should be resolved.
"At the moment I personally am firmly convinced – what have we done wrong in terms of masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach upcoming men about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to many manic characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that drives boys feel that they have to turn into this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because there's obviously something wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistory or extensions of the Game of Thrones after the end of the series in the following summer, claiming that he had "conclusive with the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit has been involved in Sam Shepherd's "Truth West", a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that dating his wife Rose was the best thing that happened at the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays Games, the girl in which Keith John Snow's hero falls in love, in a fancy series, winner of the Emey Award.
The two married in June 2018 at the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
More than 820 000 people are being affected by health services in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were caused by sexual contact, which noted a change compared to the past.
Traditional HIV is rapidly distributed to some parts of China as a result of the spillage of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV was reduced almost to zero, according to China's health services at a conference in Union Province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and spin in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in KGB communities was widespread.
According to studies of conservative values, 70–90% of men who have had sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China pledged to provide universal access to HIV medications as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data leaking by Republican party senators, vows "hazard lies" and "conspiration theories"
On Saturday, US Representatives' House member Maxine Waters charged that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from Republicans on Wikipedia legislative pages.
The L.A. democrat said the claims were made by experts and websites of the "ultra right wing".
"Friends, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of state senators Lyndsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown Capitola face during the Senate's hearing on the charges of immoral sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters' office, and released information about a member of its team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these frauds and false claims – is in no way responsible for the expiry of this information.
This unfounded statement is completely false and it is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including former White House secretary Ari Fletcher.
“There’s anger in this denial, ” wrote Flasher.
"This suggests that it does not have the temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't have to be challenging.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavano's Democrats, who was accused of critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters Place in the mid-term election, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“Probably, if it is true, ” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office was referring to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraud claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be subjected to legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all the members of my team."
Joni English's reverberation again – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek references to Brexit in every new film with British participation and it seems that this also applies to the revival of action-compartment, spy francs for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English returns".
Will self-examining and the mimes that speak how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes tied up and a "gumene" person has the opportunity to renew things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comic creation designed for fans of cinema who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering shine, has little of Clouseau, a little of Mr. Bean and a large part of the man who contributed to a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, it is originally based on the remaining chaos after itself a traveler and international man to whom Atkinson plays in Barclaycard's already forgotten TV commercials.
There's either two good times in the last Johnny English movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, carrying in a medieval armor and for a short time the blades rolled into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is rather weak and strangely excessive, especially when "serious" films brand like "007" and "mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
The Humour seems more focused on the children, not on the adults, but on Johnny English's deranged accidents in my view are not innovative and focused, as the no-play of Aktinson reminds Mr Bean.
The always current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Kiberhaker hacked the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operational agents to terrorise the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a bloated and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political intolerance: Emma Thompson gives everything he has to do for this quezi-Tereza-Me role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she needs to call a retired agent, as all acting agents are compromised.
And this means Johnny English, himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a chicing center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons about how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English has been called to Whitehall for emergency instruction and is reuniting with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man married to a submarine commander, a joyous role in which Vicki Pepperdin's talent was little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of the secret services of Her Majesty and face the fatal beautiful Ophelia Boulevatova played by Olga Curilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the creepy Jason Volta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their Odyssey of Farces: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when sneaking into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English sparks genuine anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the house of Volta.
All the smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so many sweet and rabid, there is much more content intended for children here.
A lot of mediocre production.
Just like the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Leiberists deny that they're developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to make the British work four weeks, but get paid for five.
The party claims it wants company bosses to provide economies made through revolutionary artificial intelligence to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "sharp" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week is approved by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A top source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that before the end of the year it will be notified for review of politics.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an aspiration that is included in the approach to rebalance the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its overall election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not about the party's policy."
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonal has been using the Labour Conference of last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonal said he was determined to take power back from the "unless directors" and "skullants" of the utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current owners of shares in water supply companies may not receive all of their shares, as the Labour Government could impose "procurements" on the basis of the infringements found.
In addition, he confirmed plans to bring workers into company boards and set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can collect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy spoke "60 minutes ago" about the FBI investigation that could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bret Kavano has slowed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings could force some Republican party senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview released Sunday, Scott Pelli's correspondence asked Republican party senators John Kennedy and Lyndsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I want to say, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the statement came out, and I asked him: “Have you done it?
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and in order to change it, a shake-down indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Bret rejected it firmly," Graham added, addressing Christine Blassey Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and does it even help reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and is performing an equally impressive mission: removing the world's poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the big lawn in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Carrie B and Sean Mendes, but also meet the real goal of the event – removing extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizens Festival is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are fighting it actively.
To obtain a free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "effectiveness" as voluntary participation, send no email to world leader, phone call or connection in any other way to help raise awareness about their goal of poverty elimination.
But how successful is Global Citizens 12 years before achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to be convinced to require action, or is it just another example of the so called "cliticism" – people think they are doing something significant when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, who have insisted on a number of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and communications arising from its actions, which had already paid or collected at least 10 billion dollars.
The group believes that the resources provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the "Food Force", established in the UK partnership between investors and contractors, engaging in "Helping children to develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 posts on Twitter by "glove citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a historical note," said the ambassador of the "Food Force" Tracy Ulman to the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has reported funding for the project, the "Food Force", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the VW on his website, asking, “Why do you think we can end the extreme poverty?”
Global Citizens replied: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But just like in the big civil rights movement and against the apartheid before we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, leading to the Debor-Lei Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use naval forces to "block" and prevent energy exports – the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted him as saying.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed those attending the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group presented as the "vote of energy consumers" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option regarding Iraq and Russia is, more or less, fuel stimulation and replacement," he said, while establishing Russia as a single-numbered pony with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes at a time when Trump's administration is tasked with increasing the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, becomes Berlin's "a hostage".
Moscow has several times stressed that the $11 billion pipeline at North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's burning opposition to the project has been dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (DDDI), urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kemp, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the presidential application in 2020, says Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday he would "look seriously" at the presidential application after the mid-term elections.
During a city council in Holiokee, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a serious look at the presidential application."
Warren expressed his judgment with regard to President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was revealed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh.
Speaking on Twitter Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an investigation from the FBI before we vote."
A sociological survey carried out Thursday, however, showed that the majority of the voters of Warren himself did not think that it should be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be running, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this bid.
The sociological study showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior members of the democratic party, discussed in terms of potential candidates in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Bernie Sanders' Senator.
Biden said he would take an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed to the PTSD at the Thrace Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident with domestic violence Monday night
"What my own son is going through when he comes back is known to other families who feel the consequences of the AKP and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "sent in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they return slightly changed, entrenched, returned and wondered if they would receive that respect, which they themselves and their brothers have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an unharmed state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for Vasila's police department.
18 States and Colombia support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombia support the prosecution of a new US policy that refuses asylum against victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the county applied for goodwill in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging politics, NBC News reported.
Not all of the plaintiff's name in the Greys case, which the American Union for Civil Freedoms filed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the fierce members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
The state attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, such as nations, face all kinds of gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned the decision of the Board of Appeal to immigrants since 2014, which allowed immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian lawyer Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances and such prohibition infringes this principle," the report said in favour.
In addition, lawyers say in the report that a policy which refuses to enter immigrants is harmful to the US economy, stressing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sescions ordered immigration judges to suspend granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic harassment and gang violence.
"A refuge is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear for the sake of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political convictions," Césis said in a communication of 11 July on politics.
The refuge has never been designed to alleviate all problems – not all serious ones – to whom people face each day, all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while deaths double during search for survivors
The situation about survivors is getting tougher.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute of an ambulance brings more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been spotted to return to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals injured by the earthquake with a magnet of 7.5 are crowded.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were placed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoorly due to continuing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembered how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the broken wall," Haris told Associated Press, adding that he came to town with the family to attend a wedding.
"I was listening to my wife scream for help, but then she went silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accused China of "tormos" with "propagand advertising"
One week after an official newspaper in China launched an ad on four pages in the US daily for the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US media to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in Des Mines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of taking part in the elections for the US Congress on 6 November.
Trump's indictment that Packy was trying to get the U.S. congress election involved what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in an escalating trade war that equals import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the USA and China at the beginning of the trade war, the customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Brandstad, the US ambassador to China and a former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstadt in a comment in the Sunday issue of Des Mines Register, "now doubles this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China took advantage of the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and the press, placing a paid commercial at Des Mines Register," writes Branstadt.
"Unlike that, at the press station down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have in relation to China's alarming economic trajectory, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He adds that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not specify who.
With Kavano's thunder, Republicans reject women's voter for the mid-term elections, warn analysts
Since many high-ranking Republicans are behind and protecting nominations for the Supreme Court Bret Kavano with regard to several charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a response, in particular from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the tray are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to continue to vote.
These things can not be turned back," Grant Rahrer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University of Syracuse, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahrer said he doubted whether the insistence at the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the MoveOn progressive group, said on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors scanned "Noemvri is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue with the nomination of Kavano despite Dr. Christine Blassey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rottenberg, a smart political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; it is true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among the voters of women in suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, describing her alleged sexual assault against Supreme Court nominations, analysts suggest that a response may follow if Republicans insist on confirming the bid.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee voting, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was put on the stand. It's about the way Republicans deal with it and how they treat it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect democrats.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat separated on the issue of who they believe as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, with a little more clone to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the answers definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say that they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
After Flake's insistence at the moment, the FBI is investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavano attacked her in an unfamiliar state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitalia to her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lee begins an undertaking that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology Legend, Inrut, is a company that builds the open source platform of the Burners-Lei Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company Burners-Lei, it is joke that the intention behind Inrut is a "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said with regard to the undertaking.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “online storage of personal data” or context.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through any browser, and at the same time it's all them at the same time.
The unique in the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who to what information has access to.
The company calls it "delegating personal data powers."
The idea of Inrut, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Leigh, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, contracted on the project, and a group of volunteers programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrut website.
Burners-Leigh said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are completely updated for one night.
"We do not want permission from them."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lei wrote that Inroth's mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem in order to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Lei transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Lei has had a strong influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Although starting Inrott, Bernards-Lei will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Sponsorium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the internet," Burners-Leigh added.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest, awarded with the cross Victoria during World War I
It has been observed for 100 years in the home town of the only English priest, awarded the Cross Victoria for his participation in wartime during World War I.
Lieutenant Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 at the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing he was awarded the highest military honours of Britain.
A memorial monument was discovered Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rusden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "exceptionally symbolic" for the monument to be discovered precisely 100 years from his grandfather's medal case.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van took his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in very dense fog and under severe gunfire and machine guns.”
Later, he attacked the fire line, and with “the incredible courage,” he led ahead before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me calm."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honour to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated through support that will be provided to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night long waiting to watch a complete edition of Bellator 206 and finally you cannot witness the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be broadcast live at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Ggarde Mousssi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the UK viewers remained dazzled when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after awakening to early hours, especially because of the fight.
The fan described on Twitter the switching of the children's animation film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 am this content is not appropriate, so the programme has been changed by child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President for Marketing and Communications at Bellator, in response to a question about broadcasting.
"Pepa the pig," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Koker said they would work on the planning of meetings to include UK viewers in the future.
"According to me, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six in the morning on Sunday and there is no way of planning things so that the event is held here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received many messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you that next time this won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five fights instead of six as we normally do. We tried to provide more to the fans, but we did too much.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt “lower ” because of his sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daily says he grew up, feeling less than anyone else because of his sexuality – but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying at high school, he did not realize that "they are not all like me."
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke of gay rights to give "hop" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent leader of the long-standing show, Kirsty Young, is in hospital for a few months.
When he took part in Lavern Daley's first program, he said he felt "less" than anyone else when he was growing up, as "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said: “To this day, feeling of invaluableness and being different from others are, in fact, the things that give me energy and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove it was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences and wished to inspire the hope of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man, American director Dustin Lans Black, who met in 2013, was "surprised."
Daley married Oscar's owner, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but claims that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much as you're so young," he took part for the first time in the Olympic Games at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs."
Both became parents in June and had a son named Robert Ray Black-Day, and the Daly himself says that "his entire world view" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London – because he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be there for me, Dad, or for the first order," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that point when I knew he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn't invulnerable," he said.
Next year, Daily competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamed about this my whole life – jumping into the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no more terrible feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – "Proud" by Heather Smol – who accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and still made him tense.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 pm, British summer time.
Lost-up Mikkelson remains on the Raider Expensive stand Saturday
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game at Ryder Beach, but he will have to return his old form if he does not want his record to be linked to failure.
Mikkelson, who took part in a two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the stand by Captain Jim Furik for "Fourball" and "Foursum" games Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time winner of big tournaments spent his day as a fan and training his punches away in hopes of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who, even at the top of his career, was never among the most correct players, is not in optimal shape for the difficult "Le Golf National" field where the long irregular terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the playground in itself isn't alarming enough, in Sunday's ninth game, Michelson will face the British Open Molinari, British Open champion, who is in a team with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all of his four games this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points before the 12 singles make a strong start, then it may prove that Mikkelson's match is absolutely crucial.
Furic expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, put my back on me, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
‘He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given as much as in the past as this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in just two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just worked out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the biggest game in Ryder Expensive played Sunday.
This can end his career in Ryder Beach, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and seven equal matches, but Furic said his presence brings other benefits to the team, which are not measured by numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, liked to joke with people and was a great person for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players have had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives more than just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great lead can soon be melted
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great ancestral ancestral at the last day of the Ryder Expensive can be easily erased.
The Danish debuted in the game of "Valderrama" in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Ballisteros led five points before the Americans, but it was precisely on the final line that he was almost caught and was barely able to hold the victory with 14 !"-13 .
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage of ‘Valderrama’; we had a big head and of ‘Broocline’, where we lost, and on ‘Valderrama’ we won, but very difficult,’ said Bjorn, after Europe’s 2018 team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading 10-6 to Le Golf National:.
So the story must show both to me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy, and that is exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All this time I kept saying that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we also know our rivals, who are the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never hurry up with the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, on the front plan, individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test your entire capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you must do your best.
Now you can turn your partner's back, as he should be given away to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of rival Jim Furik will ask his players to be better individually than as partners, with exceptions only Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furic himself was on both sides of these major twists on the last day – he was part of a triumph of “Broocline” and then the losing side, when Europeans performed “the miracle of Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Cranshau, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"The morning we have 12 important games, but it would be good to make the same start as you saw on "Broocline" as on "Medina".
When the advantage goes from one direction to the other, these intermediate games are played under enormous pressure.
That's why we formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want us to try and make it impossible tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading our contraband and facing Rory McElroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Jan Polter will meet other Europeans in the upper half of the arrangement.
"I chose these players in this order because I believe this gives us the greatest chances of success," Bjorn said of his choice for singles.
Germany resuspenses the launch of a new battle vessel
The latest flag of the German Navy had to be put into operation in 2014 in order to replace the aged warships of the Cold War, but this would not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and major rising costs, local media reported.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading brand of new frigates from the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The Court had to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stellar technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates should be able to be used up to two years before returning to home ports.
The continuous delays, however, mean that avant-garde warships – spoken of allowing Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when they enter into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate entered the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to release the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
It is little known about the causes of the return, but the German media quoted a number of major "favourary and hardware defects" that make the warship useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software defects are particularly important, as the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of older frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, the ship has been significantly overloaded, which reduces its effectiveness and restricts the possibility of the naval forces to add future superstructures.
The 7000-tonne ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is considered to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including training the crew – is also becoming a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet was actually "leaving out of ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem had become bigger in time, as the old ships have been taken out of operation, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class can be included in the fleet.
The National Trust Watches the Secret Life of bats
A new study carried out in a mansion in the Scottish mountains aims to find out how bats use the landscape when hunting.
Hopes are that discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats, as well as the brown arrows of water nightgowns at the Invewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key sites in the mansion to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calling sounds of bats, as well as which types they publish.
A map of habitat and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, a natural conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on habitat management, e.g. the creation of meadows, and the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
bat population in Scotland and Britain in general decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
The risk for populations may exist from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and certain chemical processes of construction materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced ecolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Threave mansion in the district of Dunfries and Galway, which is home to eight of the ten bats in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson mansion says it's perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have great ground for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and completed a proper habitat.
But there's a lot more about bats that aren't known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasises that it is important to check for bat presence before maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible that the adverse destruction of a safe haven will kill up to 400 female and young bats and destroy the entire local population.
Stickers are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their refuges.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish staff member of the bat conservation Trust, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what happens to their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims, his lawyers will sue a German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo named rape claims against him as "false news", saying people "want to become famous", using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
Portugal's attacker and Juventus was charged with rape by American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It was claimed that he then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In the Instagram video, addressing his 142 million followers, several hours after the publication of the claims, Ronald, the 33-year-old swore the post as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news," Goldball's five-time goldmaker told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to build popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy guy and everything's fine," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims that they call "inadmissible publication of suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the football player will seek compensation for "moral damages in amounts corresponding to the burden of the infringement, which probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident in question was claimed to have occurred in June 2009 at an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football player's room, where he claimed to have raped her anal according to the documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99 percent", but in this case he simply fell to "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt “feared by revenge” and was concerned that she would not be“ publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is willing to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the Ronaldo incident, it was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain will "will regret forever" that it has lost its car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever", if it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "concerning" that from Toyota UK have told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they will temporarily stop production at its Burston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the delay in the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to job losses.
In the Burston factory – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain exits from the EU at the end of March, our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, says they're going to close their Mini model factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in Brexit cases without a deal.
Toyota's production line works on the "on time" principle, with the parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for vehicles made on request.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be problems at the border, which the industry said could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than a day to fill their inventory at the Darbisher factory, the company said, and that's why production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's "shammate" plan for future interaction with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the ongoing success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity," he said in the program 4's Today on BBC Radio.
"After allegations not only toyot, but also to other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
From Toyota they cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has worked in Burston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I judge from my experience that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have set out a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor-in-chief Rod Rosenstein can be "response by another week", as candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kavano continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian intervention in elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor, or not, thereby endanger Mueller's independence, for months he has been feeding rumors about Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein is discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the seat of the United Nations in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would have preferred not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearing, which they testified on both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI against Kavanaugh's complaints, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that occur in the Supreme Court, I think it may also be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would contest this claim: Sanders did not hold a White House press conference on September 10th.
The host of the show Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences were not due to the dislike of the "democratic behavior" of television journalists, although he said: "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonic behavior."
Then she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, adding, without quoting evidence, "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if members of the press have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's far better than to talk to me.
We've been trying to do it often and you're witnesses to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when coming out of the White House or taking part in open meetings or press conferences with visiting seniors.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and sometimes strange behavior to fellow journalists.
Health Minister addresses EU workers in the National Health Service of Scotland as regards fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed EU staff working in the National Health Service of Scotland in writing to express the country's appreciation and the desire for them to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter staying less than six months until Britain was released from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, and decisions were expected in this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
I would therefore like to recall how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Throughout and beyond the EU, colleagues contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home, and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombi had an emergency surgery after receiving head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers Linekeeper Christian Abercrombi, suffered an emergency surgery after receiving head trauma during a meeting Saturday, when his team lost to Vanderbilt Comedors 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rod Reed, shared with reporters that the trauma occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just passed out there," Reed said.
Trainers and medics delivered oxygen to Abercrombi on the sideline before it was placed on the stretcher and carried into the locker room for further inspection.
Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had gotten out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/seriousness of trauma yet", as well as that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a secondary student with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher cost of purchase of real estate in Britain
Under new plans by conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher cost of purchases of real estate in Britain, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralise the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The rise in the title will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state Treasury expects an increase of more than 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher handling order for the purchase of real estate in Britain, and additional revenues will go to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the title will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, with additional revenues supporting the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The addendum, which is an addition to the current handball order, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and real estate purchased for surrender, can amount to up to three percent.
The state Treasury expects the proceeds to rise by up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13 percent of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price hikes and making it difficult for those who buy property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “transient cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the back order to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by robbing land but not using it, and asked Ms. May to abandon the quotas for accessible housing to correct the UK's "resecuritation of housing".
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to ‘no guilt’ bans.
He also wishes to give the advice greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open doors to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not proper for those who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy their homes as easily as the hardworking residents of Britain.
For too many people, the dream of having a home of their own has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team"
Sanderland manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" in his career is to be senior coach of the national team in Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of bringing the club back from northeastern England, which is currently in third position in the First League, at three points in the first place.
He went to Stadym, uh, Light this summer after last season took St. Miren back to Scotland's High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a game for the B team and that was it," Ross told Scottish BBC Sportsoon.
"But I grew up with the matches of the Scotland of Hamptons, who as a child and I watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This option, however, would only open if I had success at club level."
Among Ross' ancestors as the managers of Sanderland are names like Dick Advocaat, David Moses, Sam Allerdys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Goose Poiet and Paolo Di Canio.
Ala Atletik's former teacher said he did not feel anxious as the successor of such well-established names in a similar famous club, and previously he rejected offers from Barnzli and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I bring this club back to the Supreme League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has been a manager for only three years, after spending some time as a assistant at Dumberton and 15 months at Harts' training headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miren from a falling team to the winner of Chempianshipe in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career as a football player in Clyde, Hartlipopul, Falkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really at the crossroad," he recalls when he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best spot for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making good money, and having some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I really do, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin all my conscious life."

The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
Summer heat has increased the income of those fighting to survive British pubs, but it raises more tension for the chains of restaurants.
pub and bar groups reported an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the World Cup Business Consulate CGA, who made statistics, said: “At length of solar time and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup, a similar model followed in July as June, when pubs reported growth by 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The drop by 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June just deepened in July.
The pubs and drinking bars reported the best results in their growth compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Food pills also suffered from the sun’s time, but not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bar sales of drinks jumped 6.6 percent per month, while food was reduced by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend that we noticed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales by 4.8 percent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer couldn't appear at a worse time for food establishments managers, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring such a desired rest."
The overall growth in pubs and restaurants sales, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion British pounds, and is a certified indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides from their parents a secret profile in a social network
One in five children – some only 11 – has a secret profile in social networks, which hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 secondary school students showed the growth of fake Insta pages
News raises fears that sexual content materials are published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "primary" profile that showed their parents
One of five children – some one in 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps secret from the elderly.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to Instagram photo sharing website.
News has raised fears that sexual content materials are published.
Twenty percent of students said that they have a clean “prime” profile that shows their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who ran across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "encourage him".
The survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) in independent schools revealed that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years have two profiles, with half of them recognising that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Aid Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" at the Board of Athletics in Scotland
Aid Doyle was selected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as director without the executive functions of the annual general meeting of the managing authority.
Doyle is a minor Scottish with the greatest achievements and President Ian Byty has appointed this move as a great opportunity for those leading to sports to benefit from her rich international experience in the last decade.
"Eiled is delighted with the enormous respect of the light-year communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by attracting it," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the finals at 200 and 400 metres at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, added to its four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at BBC, lost its ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I was struck.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I've achieved a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing mobility training today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Postage for breast milk, which compared to cow mothers, split online opinions
A company that produces breast-feeding pumps has divided online opinions with ad which compared breast-feeding mothers with cows that are breast-feeding.
To mark the launch on the market of the expected ‘first silent breast pump in the world suitable for carrying’, the user technology company Elvie released the jokes music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to the cats to appear.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's boar, full of hay, in the background of a song with a text, including: "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not yours, it's my breasts."
The song continues: “Samp, pump, feed, pump, pump, pump, suck, home to your friends. ”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it defuses the dairy industry's "sicknesses".
"It is a stupid decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and have babies to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie breast pump is collected discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic both for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them for advertising a breastfeeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: “So inadequate advertising. ”
Others defended the advertising by admitting that it considered the song "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The drain made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little crazy commercial, but I'll take it for who it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a ridiculous advertising aimed at mothers who are strained (often at their jobs or toilets) and feel like“ kings. ”
This is not an ad, praising or condemning the milk processing industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they danced with discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on seeing that many women who are breastfeeding feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and gathers discreetly in a nursing bra that gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while draining.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing parallels between breastfeeding and milk cows, we wanted to focus attention on the healing of breast milk and all the challenges associated with this, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the amazing sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump is in the leading news.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the platform for designer Martha Jakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because sharp rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration were difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents that fear that they risk staying in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk rose in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults of the family should provide fingerprints, and these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wished to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“At close 80 per cent of those who are either guardians or are members of the guardian family reside illegally in the country, most of which are foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue those people," Albens said.
In an effort to manage these children more quickly, authorities have imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within the month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their case of legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as inappropriate for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely it is to become depressed or depressed, which could lead to violent bursts or escape attempts, according to shelter employees and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as this in Tornilo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the “patika city” without giving them enough time to prepare themselves at emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends, can strain the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria insists US occupation troops, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops reside illegally on Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism and "where appropriate action will be taken".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that "war against terror is almost to its end" in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been violently displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleansed, both by terrorist organisations and by "every illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are primarily training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian troops, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the land of the war - ravaged country.
In terms of refugees, Mualem said the conditions were bearable and can return by accusing “some Western countries of ‘ blowing up unsuspecting fears ’ that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue, which is an entirely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the restoration of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition for the end of the war is reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major fortress of the rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a wide-ranging attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action will be directed to jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-related al-Qaeda front "Al Nusra" who will "be destroyed".
UN envoy Stafan de Mystura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and to make the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "a review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump to win a second term
This logic makes it possible for Trump to win a reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency will not be interrupted prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the credit rating has increased to double to 1.05 million for CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the duem, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinners.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Last candidate" drama, which is told about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack against Capitolia.
Nel Skol, who is the veteran-censorshiper of comedy and author of “Just the Fun Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving in taxis in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her he was voting for Mr. Trump.
She asked "Why?"
Mrs. Skol told me that he said to her, "Because she makes me laugh."
There's fun in the mess.
Of course, unlike anything else shown on television, Washington-based stories can determine the future of Rou-Wade, whether the families of immigrants can gather again, as well as the good condition of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Sterh"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket of clumpy skin for $15,000 ("Washington Post's clothing"), and the shaking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll especially never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“At a time of what he does to make you feel as part of the reality show is to give you less every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” with regard to the changing players and daily turns (eating with the National Football League, praising Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flash this week, he was at the northern coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had closed himself at home to watch MSNBC while writing CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal committee, and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flash told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Investments are taking place in the most contested race in the early elections for a seat in Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives a flow of money, thanks to the rerouting of the Districts of Congress and from there two titlers for the same place.
The recently relocated district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh points to conservative democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another county in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th province of Pennsylvania, which is significantly advocating with the new 17th.
The cards were reassembled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were counter-constitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th provinces sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb was famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was taken by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county 20 points.
Political experts believe democrats have a slight advantage.
United States considers imposing sanctions on El Salvador over its support for China, after which it withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already admitted Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of "the recent decisions not to be recognised anymore by Taiwan," Heather Nawert, spoke to the Department earlier this month.
But sanctions were provided only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from America for the fight against drugs, with the aim of development and economic aid.
The sanctions proposed, including cutting financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American State with its unemployment rate and the rate of killings.
With the progress of the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America have postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity, which serves as a continuation of such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
In mid-September, however, the senior management authorities stated that their wish was to hold a conference, thus effectively suspending any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pens has now announced that he will participate in the conference planned for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to collecting, diplomats say.
The three US lawmakers returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next move may be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, with the report currently being considerable evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Mueller directs his investigation to whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign during their attack against our elections.
If Congress's leadership shifts, it will prove that Mr Trump will have to be reported to that body, just when he is preparing to face the voters, as well as perhaps to judges composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not believe that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – or that of him in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make those choices that will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to commit a state coup against Hitler, as long as the West had stood before him and had supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacre.
The course of history depends on such nocturnal moments, and the senseless march of democracy is rushing or slowing down.
At the moment, the Americans are facing a few such knots.
What if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein, the man holding the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble ever since this paper reported that last year he suggested that the president secretly write down the president and speculated with the opinion that it was not appropriate for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the story at the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, claimed by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved by the Supreme Court in spite of sexual abuse and fraud?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if this will force Mr Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the candles for Shabbat on that table, carrying swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna conflict
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and are aware that victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Violet earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from the League of Europe's G group.
Contusion in the knee did not allow the Graham Dorans peninsula to play its first season match before the 2-2 equality in question with the Villareal, but he believes that for the Rangers this result could become a trumplin to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old football player said.
"We entered the match in hopes that we could win something and left with a dot.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but in general equality seems to be a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
We've taken a look at Thursday, another big night from our matches in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight over the three points, this will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year, she was definitely pregnant after everything that happened along my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the way.
The team's good, and the boys are really having fun, training is useful.
I hope that we will be able to exert all our strengths to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fear of their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of the concerns they want to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
Around half of the participants in the study of Nationwide shared that they discussed their husbands' long-term care costs.
Only 10% have spoken to their children on this issue.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps towards this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with concerns unless you state your wishes in advance.
Together with your adviser and your family, discuss where and how you want to receive care as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your adviser may also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when you choose a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own resources – if you have the money resources.
Create your legal documents: Deal with the legal battles at the beginning.
Name a healthcare officer so that you have a certain trustee who oversees your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the idea of a senior officer on financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are indecisive.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical care and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in writing to prepare.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about who doctors are," Martin asks.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, authorities announced, expecting the dead to grow.
Due to the disrupted communications, aid organisations cannot obtain information from the Dongala Regentship, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the Earthquake epicenter with a magnet of 7.5.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongal, which are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulavesi province, located at the end of a narrow beach line on the western coast of Sulavesi Island, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis hit him.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the island of Sulavesi.
The regency, which is less than the province’s administrative region, is approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of central Sulavesi province, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel's acquisition is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times since tsunamis over the last 100 years, according to Indonesian Agency for Recovery after disaster.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami hit the west of Dongala and in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Tikokean Fire Ring” and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong tremor on December 26th on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggers a wave of tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people across the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Magtwood Trus 6.8 cuts across Indonesia's most populated island, Java, activating tsunamis that broke down on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnetic earthquake 7.6 hit near Padang City, West Sumatra Province capital.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: Magtwood Earthquake 7.5 prunes one of the islands Mentawa and activates a 10-metre tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pedi Jaya's regeneration in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastations of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, no tsunamis were activated, but more than 100 people were killed by broken buildings.
2018: Strong tremors cut Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, more than 500 people were killed, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Paylin's biggest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Tuck Peelin, the largest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sara Peelin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Paylin, 29, from Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicions of domestic violence, interference with a declaration of domestic violence and resistance in custody, according to a report by the state police in Alaska published on Saturday.

He's also being charged with a class B bill, which he punishes with one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time you've brought criminal charges against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a fist in her face.
Sara Peelin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behaviour to post-traumatic stress, arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died of an earthquake that pierced the Indonesian island of Sulavese on Friday.
The Magtwood earthquake, 7.5, caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks have been cut off, with the number of dead people expected to grow in the near days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulavesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jackarta.
The social media is revolving videos showing the time of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the wave tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist assassination in New York City
Federal New York prosecutors want the death penalty for Syfolo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist assassination, which left eight people dead – a rare common punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, 30 years old, used a truck rental on Home Depot to execute the October bombing of the bike near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, assuring pedestrians and cyclists along his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "imposedly" has killed eight victims and "imposedly" has caused severe bodily injuries, according to a notice of intent regarding the death penalty claimed in the South, New York.
According to the court document, both charges can end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an extended federal court board filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, including eight counts of murder in connection with a review used normally by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of the MPs.
The attack required “serious planning and deliberateness, ” the prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov was carried out as “frightful, cruel and sick.”
"Syfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused traumas, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lorey Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Ernan Fellucci and Alejandro Damian Panuco," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last South of New York City was looking for a death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a federal trial death was executed in New York in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conviction for conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret during the days and months following the assassination, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack after he watched IDIL's videos on his phone, the prosecutor's act said.
He also asked in his hospital room to put the flag on ISIS, police said.
He pleads not guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were “obviously disappointed ” in the prosecution’s decision.
"According to us, the decision to seek a death sentence rather than to accept a sentence of guilty and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all concerned," Paton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked the D.A.'s office not to seek death sentence.
Member of the Conservatives Parliament says NAZEL FARAZ must lead the negotiations on Brexit
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the conference of conservatives.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "affect the pressure" -- as one of Teresa May's own party members -- suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, MP from the Conservatives, said in March in Birmingham that Britain had "exited so far", if Mr Farage was the secretary of the issues of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to deal with the deeply divided ranks of the party was highlighted by conservatives supporting the staying, who joined a separate protest against Brexit, in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan "Chequers", despite attacks by supportees Brexit, supporters of the EU as well.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labourists choose between its package and the 'haosa'.
Mr. Bon told protestors with the ‘Exit’ vineyard that he wanted to ‘forgo Chequers’.
He stressed that Mr Farage had to participate equally with the others and that he had to receive the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left so far," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to throw away the 'Chequers' plan.
As he applied his opposition attitude to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars, so that we might be deplorable.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bon rejected the allegations that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: “The belief that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay is completely false.”
Conservatives representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally by sharing with reporters: “I’m simply saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chiquers is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually went out on the street and have actually helped us be elected.
Please dump "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their position when they observe their promises. ”
Mr Faraz said at the rally that politicians must ‘ feel the pressure’ if they intend to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change to Brexit and we're gathered here today to say, "We won't let you get away with this."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We're mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has helped us win at Brexit, and we're never going to stop until we're independent, self-governmenting, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters crossed the border through Birmingham before conducting a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags with inscriptions "Conservators Against Brexit" after the group started this weekend.
Leiberist Lord Adoniis has mocked conservatives for the security issues of the party's application when it was discovered at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can deploy the IT systems and the entire technology of Canada and more, and more, for the continuous crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren says he will "think seriously" his bid for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced he would "think seriously the possibility of running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats' representative spoke about her future during a city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican US representative Jeff Deil, who was joint president of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the centre of speculation that it can take Trump's post in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holioque was its 36th meeting with voters in the town hall following Trump's entry into office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and correct our damaged government, and this includes women at the top.
Arrested for Simms' death from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in the shooting Friday, when a basketball player named Wade Simms was killed by LSU.
Baton Rouge's police department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man on the footage.
Simms, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms has been shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the scene, had a gun and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested seamlessly and detained in the custody of the Eastern Baton Rouge Police Department.
A young man with a height of 6′16, grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms took part in 32 matches with 10 exits as the title of last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 fights at the game.
Gran Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer and closer to the world title after the team's instructions helped him defeat Sebastian Feltel
From the moment that Valterie Botas was ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously troubled Hamilton while protecting his position in the first two turns, allowing Fel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next tour and came out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat it after a daring maneuver and driving "moving tire to tire", which forced Ferrari's pilot with a reluctantness to release the inside of the track to avoid punishment with an added time after he had already closed the way of his opponent with a dangerous double-protective maneuver of the third turn.
On my 21st birthday, Max Verstapen started from the rear row of the start grid and was seventh after the end of the first round.
Then he even led through a very long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly outrun Kimmy Raikonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for the pit stop in the 44th round, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps, and in the end Raikonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, since Valterie did a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me beat him up.
The team did an extraordinary job to win the first two places on the stage," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein on Sunday for claiming that she had not spread the letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing the Supreme Court's claim to Brett Cavanaugh into sexual assault.
During a talk at the rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, instead comment on how what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "silent and disgusting and untrue".
"What can happen is the good that has been happening in the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and untrue," he said.
"When you look at publications and distributions, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't spread it," he added, emulated the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter detailing Ford's claims against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Feinstein denies this spread to happen from her office.
"I didn't cover Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Finstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality and I kept confidentiality as she wished."
But her rejection was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continueing to defend the Supreme Court's claim for sexual crimes against three women, the president stressed that the Democrats used claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power with all possible means.
See the shamelessness, the shamelessness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control," the president said, according to Mediate.
Elliot League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants vs. Dundy
Dundy Stars got back for Friday's loss at Elliot League against Belfast Giants, winning a five-three standoff in Dundy on Saturday.
Giants took early to the match with two goals after the blows of Patrick Dwight and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney leveled up for the housewives before Dudeer regained Jains' head start.
Francois Busher tied to Dundy before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nilssen confirmed their victory.
It's the third win in Elliot League for Adam Keef's boys who got out of the bottom to beat Dundy in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between opponents this season, as the Giants won the previous three games.
The shot that Dwyer discovered came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assist, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance, as he assisted Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level up with Kauni's help at 15:16.
Dwyer made an effort to lead the Giants before the first break, noting a second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
Housewives regrouped and Busher again evened the chances with a powerful blow at the door at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nilssen give Dundy the first time this match at the end of the second half, making up his best to win the team with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who lost the last four matches of a total of five meetings, met as housewives Milton Keyes for their next game on Friday.
Flight manager died to make sure hundreds of people on board an airplane could escape an earthquake.
The commander of flights to Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, guaranteeing that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that hit Sulavese Island on Friday, triggering a wave of tsunamis.
The strong secondary shocks continued to defeat the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a highly distressing control tower at Mutira Sis Al-Juffrey Airport.
He remained on site to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was crashing down.
Later, he died in the hospital.
Air Control spokeswoman Indonesia, Johannes Sirith, said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will grow as many bodies are still under the debris and many people cannot reach it," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six metres devastated Palu, where a mass burial took place Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry aids and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's marches everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widado arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that one person is unknown after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried a plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific now reports that a person was declared missing after earlier said that all 47 people passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that Saturday afternoon they cannot contact a male herd.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details of the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were admitted to a hospital.
The airline said six herds were left and Saturday at the hospital, and everyone was in stable condition.
The reasons for the disaster and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the US naval forces said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane went very low.
"This is extremely good," says Janes.
Janes says he and the others managed to run through the deep to the crosswater to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses had gone into panic and screamed, and that he had suffered a slight head trauma.
The U.S. Navy forces say that sailors, repairing docks nearby, also helped in the rescue operation by using an invading boat to get people to the shore before the plane sank into the deep, about 30 metres (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Aviation Network indicate that in the last two decades, 111 people have died in airlines registered at PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
An analyst shows the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended with its statement on this Saturday in a retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulett of the US Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to assemble the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulett said he received a location from several cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, back to his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to interview Sandford.
Sandford faced a court Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Mobile records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulett pointed out that shortly after Chambers' death, he erased text messages, calls, and phone contact information.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about genre by filling out his music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that the hip-hop has strayed from its origin of political statements and involvement with social problems.
They want to go back to its roots and promote the conscious hip-hop again.
Artists of the type of The Fugees and Common are being raised in Britain by performers like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nanny judges couple after dismissal for "racist" message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a false message from the mother who complains that she is "another black woman".
The couple deny to be racist, decimating the claim of "extortion".
Lynzi Plasko-Flaksman, the mother of two, was crushed when she realized that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEE, THE REAL CERNOKE," Mrs Pasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him to Mrs. Morris twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs Pasco-Flaxman felt that she had not done her job well and that she had been expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris received a fee for a one-day job then sent home by taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, asking for the amount of $350 a day for the six-month agreement it was initially hired, even though she didn't have a contract.
"I want to show them, see, you don't have to do this," she told Post on Friday, adding "I'm sure that's discrimination".
In response, the couple claimed that they were not racists, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable action, as they feared that they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Pasco told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it had been wrong?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
By distinguishing a claim of "extortion", Plesko claims that his wife was born only two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
"You're going to attack someone in this state?
This is not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the case is still under consideration, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks by lamenting them for their conduct and logic.
The Paddington publishers feared that readers would not feel connected to a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, was born soon after the book was adopted by the audience, relates about the letter: “It is hard to be placed in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
Now it's a lot of fun, since we're aware of Padington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, would feel optimistic about the possible rejection of the book, adding that she met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
With regard to Padington, whom she described as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not a boaster," she said.
"But since you felt Paddington so real, it's like having a child who's achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your case.
I think she kind of accepted Padington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Padington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter landed, she was taken to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors in vain fought to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that the situation is really bad, that she does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Enen-Laperuz.
"After that, Nade called me to say that he was going to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll come to you.
Medicines given to her by doctors to maintain her heart slowly cease to act and leave her system.
She's gone a while before, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that this was all happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get really tight."
Finally, Mrs. Enen-Laperuz, who, until now, mourns the loss of his daughter, gets on the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test that he is going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I was bending my head, and all the while my tears were leaking.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy with over.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieved women put cards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones for suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales Cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by smile.
They've always said his smile brightens every room."
However, he gave up his work before leaving, and he was in “a real dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that this will have some consequences."
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “so that people know that there is someone to go to and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Do not remain silent – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
‘Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he did not look at them or anything."
She said that this was a terrible injury to them, but they had to cope: “This opens up a void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight."
If you are struggling to cope, you can contact the Samaritans free of charge at 116 123 (for Britain and Ireland), send an email to them@samaritans.org or visit the website of the Samaritans here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question after the FBI is launching an investigation.
I was wondering if we could really achieve what he wanted – an investigation with a limited duration and a limited scope – maybe we could join our efforts," Mr. Flack said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart in spite of the solid above-party blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans ask the FBI to conduct an investigation?
It's because of the moment.
The early elections are only five weeks later, on November 6 – if, as expected, the Republican people do not perform well, their attempts to elect their representative in the highest court in the country will seriously be damaged.
George W. Bush calls senators by inviting them to support Mr. Kavano, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where members are currently 51 Republican and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his bid for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives is "reducing" to Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Soog, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said last year there were 1127 fugitives, and for comparison in 2011, they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human smugglers are key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the North's fugitives eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed an illegal border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, where is the longest border with North Korea and goes easier than the strictly protected demilitarised area (DMZ), which divides both roots.
China considers refugees illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on a standstill in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore where they agreed in general to work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho charged US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security, and in these circumstances there is no way to be unarmed first unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelossi called Brett Cavanaugh "hissteric" and said it was not suitable for service at the Supreme Court.
Congress minority leader Nancy Pelossi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh a "sterious" and said he was too unbalanced for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way I could not think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her "exertial," Pelossi said of his reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavano was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and felt when discussing his family and his academic years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling him "a Greek and co-ordinated attack on personality", organised by liberals, who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that, according to her, Kavano's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, since it became clear that he was prejudiced with regard to the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and with the way the Clintons and Democrats are being pursued," she said.
Pelosi denied it when she was asked if she would try to discredit Kavano if he was appointed and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say it that way – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unfit to enter the Supreme Court, but also in a court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Cavanaugh's potential rulings regarding the Accessible Health Care Act or the Rou case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for an ideological, preconceived man to enter the court and expect us to say, "Isn't it great," Pelosy concluded.
And women have to take control.
It's a legitimate criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinum told me 45 years later.
"I don't consider it unusual, but you?"
She continued, “I received a great help from a woman who was executive director somewhere, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, which, when she got angry and wept, she said to her neighbor, “You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going on.
I thought this was genius."
Tears are allowed in an expression of anger, in part because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my most clear memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how one time, while I was whining about inexpressible rage, older than I was, a woman caught me at the door – a chilling manager, from whom I was always a little afraid – and she dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congressman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship of a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided there was no reason why he should not consider the idea of running for president she herself.
"It wasn't a good decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to do was another one show up.
Someone called the situation “Snejanka and the seven dwarfs. ”
Since it is involved late in the campaign, it is lagging behind in raising funds and deciding that it will not remain in the race if it fails to raise $2 million.
The battle is predetermined to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she says that she will not continue with a formal campaign, she is taken by so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, discontent with the system, which makes it so hard to gather money and can turn to voters, not delegates, as well as anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think that I've had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
"Someone can think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were gonna write on my tombstone?
"She's crying"?
How the US-China trade war can serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle is still gaining speed, a break between the two countries will bring Beijing's benefit in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning breath this year, betting tax on key export elements of China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of tensions occurred this week with new duties affecting the production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time Beijing returned with new duties of five to ten percent of US goods to $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to every blow to the United States and soon it is not expected that the second largest world economy should ignore this.
To make Washington give up means to submit to the demands, but to take his head down publicly before Washington would be too embarrassing for Si Jinpin, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays cards correctly, pressure from the trade war with the United States can help in the long term of China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political solution in both Washington and Beijing can create conditions for an economic crisis in any of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have recognised before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher on issues related to Asia to the expert group Center for New American Security.
Syria "gotto" for refugee returns, foreign minister says
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in the restoration of the war-torn country for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem stressed that the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in a place is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to bring them back to normal.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and food.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian help.
Al-Malem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance would not be accepted from countries that financed the rebels.
Europe wins Ryder Expensive in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Expensive for 2018, winning the United States team with a final score of 16.5 on 10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has had six consecutive losses on European land and has not earned the Ryder Beach in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The star of the United States, Phil Michelson, who presented himself weakly during most of the tournament, sent his first blow to the 16th hole (with “par” 3”) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was excellent in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament reached a 5-0-0 balance since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spitt has definitely lost 5 & 4 of the player in the team of Europe, which is the lowest in the ranking – Torbörn Olesen from Denmark.
The leader in the world ranch, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 Ian Poulter of England, probably the last part of the Ryder Expensive.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight "Rader Beach", became the European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing its asset to 25.5 points this year.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold back.
It was a tough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can lift the bowl again.
All that matters is the team and I am happy that I have been able to help," said the excited Garcia after Europe's victory.
He handed over his fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated the US legend Tiger Woods with 2 & 1 singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and its total balance of Ryder Beach is 13-21-3.
Strange statistics on one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 great titles – an indicator that only gives Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team experienced difficulties all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf all day long from the tournament.
The captain of the US team Jim Furic shared after a disappointing performance of the team: “I am proud of these boys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pressed the Europe team.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players introduced themselves very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the United States Association of Professional golfers and our Paradise Committee, and we will only look forward to it.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just out-of-play."
New for the red tide: Concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manotai and Sarasota
The latest report by the Committee on Fish and Wildlife in Florida shows a fundamental reduction in red inflow concentrations in sections of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there have been reports on the growth-absorbing conditions in the areas of the Pinelas, Manoti, Sarasote, Charlotte and Collier districts – this shows a decrease in concentrations.
Water sections with an excessive bloom of red tide spread to approximately 130 miles along the coast, from the northern province of Pinellas to the southern region of Lee.
Divisions of seaweed can be seen 10 miles off the coast of the Hillsboro county, but less than last week.
A red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Over the past week, there have been reports of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or a little further inside the province of Pinellas, low to high concentrations on the coast of the Hillsbaro district, assumptions of high concentrations in the Manoti district, assumptions of high concentrations in the coastal area or further into the Sarasote County, assumptions of moderate concentrations in the Charlotte district, assumptions of high concentrations in the coastal area or in the area of Lee, as well as low concentrations in the collier district.
Reports of airway inflammations in the Pinelas, Manoti, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier districts continue to be received.
