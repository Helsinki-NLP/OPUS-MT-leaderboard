Members of the Allied Assembly worry that they are “like Mupettos”
Some members of the Assembly are threatened by the proposal to call themselves the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, a member of the Valyrian Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Walloon Parliament.
Throughout the political spectrum, members of the congregation are concerned that they will be ridiculed.
A member of the assembly of the species of Labour said they were concerned in their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales, twp means stupid and pup poop.
A member of the assembly from the Plaid Cimru party said that their group as a whole was “not satisfied” and suggested other options.
The Valian Conservatives said that his group of "open spirit" regarding a change of name, while warning that there was a small difference between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the phrase “w” is similar to the pronunciation of “u” in the yorkshire phrase.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting draft legislation to present changes to the name, stated: "The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be taken by its members."
By the Law of Wales Act 2017, the Vales Assembly was empowered to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valian Parliament Assembly.
For members of the Assembly, the Commission selected the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP”, but the most public consultation provided the possibility of “MWP”.
The members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for the chairperson Elin Jones, who has to submit draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the non-compliance with the functions of members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their designation.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to turn their country's name into "The North Macedonia Republic".
By voting, they want to resolve decades of long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens insisted that the name of their northern neighbour constituted the right to their territory and repeatedly opposed its application for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on a change of name, said he would not take the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is the price they must pay for EU and NATO accession.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church were silent as the churches in Harlem are facing difficulties
“The older people I talked to say that sometimes the bar and church were on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People hang out today differently.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly wander."
In church, however, he is concerned that money from the sale of funds will not last as long as leaders expect and that it will be again soon.
He added that churches could be replaced with housing buildings with a common administration (condominium), where people who will not help shelter the neighborhood who have remained.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominium in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and so the day will come quickly when all these churches will close, as it is unlikely that the people who move to these condoms will become members of this church.”
The two churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin” decades later.
The original Belgian Methodist Church Society moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black religious community, which served as a god nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who on 125th street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led battle as sellers who refused to employ or support the blacks.
The fire in 1939 was severely damaged by the building, but when the parishioners were planning a reconstruction, they ordered ringing bells.
To honor David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and successor to St Martin's Church, the bells proudly referred to as "the bells for poor people".
In July, an expert named them a little different: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
She also pointed out from the University of Michigan that it was the first bells to click on which he played a black-polt musician, Dionysio A. Link, who went to the Riverside Church church 18 years ago, where he knocked on bigger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that in St. Martin’s church it was not replaced.
In the last few months there has been a complicated story with architects and contractors; some have brought the church laity and others to the diocese.
Protection — the administrative body of the parish, consisting of the laiquis — wrote in July that she was concerned that the bishop would “try to transfer the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not included in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained about transparency by the bishop.
Sea dog injured a 13-year-old boy hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday, in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old girl in hunting lobsters at the opening of a lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. in the vicinity of Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he and the group swam to him and helped him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was just thrilled to catch the lobster, and then he realized that he was screaming “He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed he had his whole clavicle torn apart.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: “There’s a shark in the water!” he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
A water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that several weeks earlier the shark was spotted in this area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper part of the body.
For 48 hours, they prevented access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to Swami beach’s in Ecinitas due to investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes in Boots, Super Other and Debenhams with beautiful corners as they have in department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of entering the British beauty market, worth GBP 2.8 billion and still growing, while selling clothes and household appliances will drop, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and in several stores next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelf used previously for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s they say they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oral, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also be given more space in areas with brands similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also relives its stupid supply of cosmetic products, so that most of the products are vegan – something younger shoppers increasingly require.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury stores. The first one opened in Croydon in southern London and the second will open in Celly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
For the sake of online shopping and daily shopping of smaller quantities of food in local shops, supermarkets should do their best to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director at Sainstoy’s, said that retail shops would be like department stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight the discount Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury Group”s opened Argos outlets in several hundred shops, as well as Habitat stores, since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and was more profitable.
Previous try a supermarket to rebuild their compartments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, they ended up unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s took a joint venture from the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the link ended after the drug profit-sharing dispute in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago sold GBP 125 million to its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celiso, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
They announced that Lloyds would play a role in this plan, as they were to expand the offer of luxury skin care brands, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our beauty corners and have improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our brand offers are designed to meet all needs, an attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination, which is a challenge for the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones »best« because Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound deal
The star of Dragons Den (Good Business) is furious because TV leader Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a $11 million deal with his life-style brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and accessories Truly.
The company was compared with Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, 37, was released on Instagram to withdraw.
Holly Willoughby was raging the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones as she has recently withdrawn from their life-style profitable business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “obessed” when the golden girl was in television on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company's headquarters in Buckinghamshire admitted that due to her new business — worth up to 1.5 million pounds — there is not enough time to dedicate their brand of clothes and accessories Truly.
The company was compared with Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and predicted to double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When her 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly's brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long-term future to spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely impressed everyone involved.
Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on because opening was so close.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at the headquarters of the company in Marlow.”
Experts believe that this Morning, which was among the most interesting associations for banks in Britain, would have cost millions because of major investments in products, pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening up.
Moreover, this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughbye, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, were good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In March 2016, Willoughby founded Truly and Capopo in 2016 and took over 52 years of Jones as president.
In addition, Jones held a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV broadcasts I’m A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about media criticism due to a comment that some sees as “non-presidential” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his ridiculed "renewary" voice:
“I didn’t give up.”
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June was marked by Trump as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have failed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korean diplomacy of Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "adequate response" to the previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States would continue to face sanctions that would continue to put pressure on them.
Trump was far more optimistic in his address.
"North Korea is doing great to us," he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results — stopped rocket testing, helped free hostages, and brought home the death remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
"It is very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this loaded-up scene, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and pointed to the crowd directly ahead.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, the consequences of the Lomboku earthquake were told to foreign NGOs that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lomboka have been exceeded, they have not declared natural disasters, which is a condition for sending international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not require international assistance and therefore the situation is somewhat complicated," said Sumungov.
Save the Children's organization consists of a team that will travel to Palo, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, representative of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Pallu and will determine whether they will allow international agencies to help.
Given that the earthquakes in Indonesia are constant, the state remains completely unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although a shelter was built in Aceh through tsunamis, it is not common practice on other shores.
The obvious absence of the warning siren for the tsunamis in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although the warning was valid.
Traveling among many Indonesian islands is also a challenge at the best times.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is in favor of the victims of the earthquake anchored in Lombok, is heading toward Palu, but will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Wido has put improved Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaigns and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for Jokov's administration in the re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from long - term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were evacuated from their home because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with mothers, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hit for late equality against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the defeat against Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a hit in 89 minutes in the first English league.
It is the seat of the Municipality of Šentružen in northeastern Slovenia.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the remote door.
Shots fired high above the crime scene towards the right top corner of the door.
The ball eventually went down through the doorkeeper Kepe Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I was just trying to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq, they always drag it forward as much as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” said Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I had no longer thought much and simply decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime with a hit by Belgian player, Eden Hazard, in 25 minutes.
In this action with a fifth, the wise attacker gave the ball back to Mateu Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovačić quickly reached out in the middle and ran ahead.
Then he gave a nice hand through the defenses, and Haszard ran into a criminal space.
Hashard beat the defense and shot his left leg at a remote doorway through Liverpool's doorman, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, in the group part of the League of Champions.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.

Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memory target of the conflict on "Rewrite of History"
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanaticists of Puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society identified Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and the "test of writing history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s discussion of the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westministre Palace will become the target.”
Iconoclasm in English civil wars Cromwell did not even perform orders.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor in the previous century.
A brilliant presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft has witnessed the 19th century opinion and is part of a history of personality, which some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella of many people (possibly more in the late 19th century than today) see as a protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Is this a purely accurate show, the subject of constant historical debates.
It is clear that in the mid - 17th century, the conflict formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time Lord was a protector also deserve celebration and memory."
Murderary pig killed Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig was attacked and killed by a farmer on a market in southwestern China.
The male, identified only by the surname “Yuan”, was found dead by a cut-off artery and covered with blood near a pig on a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, was reported Sunday at the South China Morning Post newspaper.
The pig breeder is preparing for the vaccination of pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining Province of Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, she and her cousin were due to travel from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody mouth in it.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig killed a farmer until he died.
“Wu’s legs were bloody and loose,” quoted his cousin as “Wu” at Guyang Evening News.
Security cameras showed Yuang came to the market Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan wasn't even his cousin.
The market manager told Eveninging News that the pig had been shut down so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the management of the market are to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks have already been reported on a person.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered severe physical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig squeezed a vanilla farmer against a tractor, but then his wife drove off an animal.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, anotherlet farmer from CBC News said that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "producer".
"We'd just play.
They're like little kids, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
All they need to do is show them a sufficient degree of respect," he said.
There's a heavy rain coming to the southwest of the United States because of the remains of Rosa's hurricane
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa moves towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and the weak.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floods to northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa is from Sunday from 5:00 am in the Eastern War of Hurricane 1st category at wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punte Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the area of low air pressure is increasing over the Pacific Ocean, which is moving east toward the western coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push the high tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical investment, which will mix with the low air pressure area, will create abundant rainfalls in the wider southwest region.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, flooding and the possibility of earth’s plasma in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will reach 50 to 75 mm an hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest parts, mainly above the larger portion of Arizona, is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rainfall.
Floods are possible due to a rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
A foot in the desert would be very reckless when there is a risk of tropical rain.
The heavy rains can turn the canyons into virgin rivers, and the storms will bring local wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring local rains to the parts of the coast of South California.
There may be more than 12 mm of rainfall, which may lead to a reduction in rainfall and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy period.
A few scattered tropical fields will start approaching Arizona on Saturday afternoon and on Monday morning, late on Monday and on Tuesday, the rainfall will spread.
Heavy rains will spread on all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States, as Arctics cool and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Canada City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Mines in Iowa, there are 20 degrees of difference.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to settle and expand again.
The majority of Central and Eastern US will enter warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plains region to parts of the north-east.
In New York, they could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good odds of temperatures above average for the United States east in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the interesting Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who was accused of having a sexual assault that was supposed to occur in 1980.
In the meantime, the political path of the position continued, as TV stations broke down due to Friday's overturn in the last minute: an agreement drawn up by Arizon Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford said that she was 100% convinced by the Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was in a guilty state and tried to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning statement that he was 100% convinced that this did not happen.
Nielsen reports that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people are expected to be present.
The company considered the average viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBB TV networks.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast testimony, including the PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems counting viewers who view the program in offices.
To facilitate the performance, the view is similar to the one in playing the football game playoffs or awarding the American Film Academy awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support the Kavanaugh appointment, leads all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
In the second place, ABC is with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
Even after the hearing, the interest remained high.
Flake played a central role in the PTA.
After the office of the moderate republic made a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the television cameras of CNN and CBS recorded how the protesters screamed at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
During the building, he shared a glimpse of what was caught live by videos of the CNN TV house.
"I am standing here before you," a woman told him.
"Do you think he's telling the truth of the country?
You have power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee's hearing, and then the elevator door had closed.
All television networks were broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted in favour of the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate.
However, Flake said he would do so only if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, which was called upon by a minority party of Democrats.
In part, Flake has talked to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's voice was decisive, since it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump launched an investigation into the U.S. Federal Investigation Office (FBI) of Kavanaugh's charges against him.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of "Policy Games" at the bank
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her of "playing political games" with the British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May to the Conference of the Conservative Parties in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Rixite plan and said that the proposal for Britain and the EU was to pay customs to another "once absurd".
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of the death of an actor of the LSU team
The police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU team.
According to a police report from Baron Rouge, Dytheon Simpson was arrested 20 years and taken to prison for murdering a second degree.
The officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police that he lost his sunglasses during the fight.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wyde until he died.
The security is $350,000, a lawyer reports.
On Friday, a coroner from East Baton Rouge Parish district issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
In order to assist the investigation leading to the arrest, the police thanked the special unit for the fugitives of the Louisian State Police, the criminal laboratory of state police, the South University police and the residents of the region.
The sports director of the LSU team Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their "care and search for justice".
Sims was 20.
The 201-cent-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The last season, on average, collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU team Will Wade said that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" because of Wade's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," said Wade.
Voulkan Peasant on Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes that the Popocatepetl volcano vomits reached the southern neighbourhood of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the national disaster prevention centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as the activity increased over the crater and recorded 183 gas emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The Centre has observed several cases of thundering and earthquake shocks.
Images on social networks showed thin layers of ash, covering windscreens of cars in the neighbourhood capital of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increased activity in a volcano lying 72 kilometers south-east of the capital, after an earthquake with a power of 7.1 degrees earthquake to Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan Separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors who supported independence fought anti-excessive police units and joined several thousand people in the Roman demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catalonian polarised secession vote.
A group of masked separatism supporters, held by anti-excessive police units, threw them with eggs and metal powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually overdrived with tourists.
Later there were fights, and policemen had to use pendrecks to stop conflicts.
The supporters of independence, who shouted "without forgetting, without forgiveness", faced protestors who supported unity and cried out "Let Spain Live!".
As local media reports, 14 people in protests received easier injuries.
The year following the referendum of 1 October, which was designated as illegal in Madrid and the Catholic separatists were celebrating it, the tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although the participation was low, since the opponents of the secession were largely boycotted by the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year, after police tried to stop the continuing vote in the polls in the region in violent conflicts.
Over the night, groups that support independence were beaten in front of the electorate to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
The 68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a significant, although close victory in the previous December regional elections, the Catalan parties that support independence have been difficult to keep up this year as many of the most well-known leaders in voluntary exile are, or in custody, await their role in organising a referendum and declaring independence later.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who made a protest in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the trial began, announced that he will run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"To apply to the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in the democratic values and oppression we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested the men who ran into the house by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested because they hit the house in Londonerry several times.
It was held on the streets of Balllynard Crescent on Thursday at about 19.30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they were supposed to shoot a crossbow at the car.
With Mengae hit, Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga, with his first goal for Livingston, guarantees victory
The song was released on September 11, 18, and was released on December 10, 1924.
The shooting of Dolly Mengae made the difference, as the Gary Holt team was equal to the Hibernian team in the second place.
Gerrard's team is thus left without a victory in the guests of this year's championship, and the next Sunday, Hearts, who runs the scale and for which they are behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased his series of indignities in division to six matches and chief coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, had not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston wastes his chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have led quite before the hit, as they caused a number of problems with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the door, but he sent the ball over the door, and Alan Lithgow hit the door, and Craig Halket shot his head over the goal.
The hosts gave the game to the Rangers because they knew that the guests could be dangerous when they interrupted the attack.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston free shot and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengae, who shot and hit from the middle of the criminal area.
The Rangers had bigger possessions of the ball, but the local defenses couldn't break through, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos extorted Kelly's defense.
The Rangers' Door Allan McGregor took the shot from Scott Pittman's leg, while Lithgow fired a naked shot from another Livingston break in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingston's criminal space, but the domestics removed all attacks, two misdemeanors — the Halkets ’ offence against Glen Middleton's replacement and the offense to play with the hand — and the judge failed to deliver.
“Excellent performance” Livingston — Analysis
Alassdair Lamont (BBBC Scotland) at the stadium Tony Macaroni Arena
Great show and score for Livingston.
All were excellent and continued to go beyond the expectations on this path of theirs.
The style of the game and the law has not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt must be credited for the way he awakened the team from his arrival.
There were many heroes.
He had a very important role to play by Captain Halket and had a well-organised defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral on standby all the time.
And the Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard’s leadership, they are very short of these standards.
Shots were missing – only once successfully overcoming host defenses – and it's some kind of Ranger wake for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the scale.
Erdegan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue sky prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes regarding human rights, press freedom and the Turkish approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 heads prevented the crowds from collecting in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to get closer to seeing their own president.
They also expressed hundreds of protesters – many of them Kurds – who do not support the Government of Erdogan and condemned Erdnot's policy and decision by the German Government to welcome him in the country.
Controversial protests reflect divisions regarding a visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others view as an autocrat.
An accident on the road in Deptford: a cyclist has been killed in a car crash
In London, the rider had a fatal accident in a car crash.
The accident occurred near a crossroads between the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford, southeastern town, about 10.15 after British summer time.
The car driver stopped, and the ambulances came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred only a few months after the biker died in a crash in which the car driver ran away on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking on a man's identity so they can inform their relatives.
They put road closures and rerouted bus lines, and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Excessive · Global Voices
Six prison guards were injured in an outbreak in a heavily guarded men's prison, the prison administration reported.
The riot broke out at the HMP Long Laartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30 p.m., and is still underway.
The police officers called the Tornado unit to take care of an outbreak involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor injuries on the face on the spot.
A representative of the prison staff said: “We have called on specially trained staff to take care of the outbreak in HMP Long Laartin Prison.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this, and therefore may be further behind bars."
The prison of HMP Long Lartin is more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June was reported to have been the administrator of the hospital care facility for being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, an anti-excessive police unit was called to intervene in a serious disturbance where staff were attacked with pool bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of the Hurricane Rosa pushes its way through the southwest deserts and risks sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for Mondays and Tuesdays for Western Arizona, South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including Phoenix cities, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is supposed to be raging over Phoenix on Tuesday, and he's gonna be nearing late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service reported that only “ten tropical cycles have maintained tropical storm status or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) was furious about 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.”
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre foresee 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfalls of up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, it is expected from 25 to 50 mm of rainfall, individual rainfalls up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing, as the region has affected droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as it currently takes a dry period in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought tracking centre, good 40 percent Arizona is experiencing at least extreme droughts," reports weather.com.
The route of Rosa first leads to the land of the Mexican Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, still in power on Sunday morning, at maximum wind speed 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punte Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at 19 km per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific, and that's why it's weak.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach the power of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great danger to floods.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwestern Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with the option of 250 mm of rainfall,” were reported on the weather.com website.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early mornings on Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and towards the south Utah until late night on Tuesday.
"The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remains is heavy rain on the Baja Caliphonia peninsula in the northwestern Sonore and in the US southwestern desert," they said at the National Hurricane Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and earth’s valleys in mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspected attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
An injured teenager was found in the Extremation Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 P.M. after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remained "stable".
17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area at night, police from Avon and Someseta reported.
The cops are calling on everyone who may have caught up with their cell phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "sustained the unkindness and anger" of the democratic party
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against impassion and an outrageous tactic of the democratic party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "absorbed the unkindness and anger" of the democratic party in the process of his appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before the convention, clearly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when her teenagers were.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusations.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day the Americans saw the Kavanaugh brilliance, quality and courage.
“The role to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, the lawyer with an outstanding record of public service,” said the crowds of supporters in western Virginia.
Indirectly, the President mentioned the Kavanaugh appointment when he spoke of the importance of the republic's election in the mid-election elections.
"It's five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm really trying to be a candidate," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argues that the Democrats are on the mission of "confidence and obstacle".
The first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh Appointment Chamber was to take place on Friday at the latest, the adviser of the Republican Party told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killing hundreds of people, the number of victims is increasing
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawisi, many of them carried huge waves that buttled along the coast.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Pale, when six metres of waves hit the shore and took many to death and destroyed everything in their path.
Cunami was followed by an earthquake with a power of 7.5 degrees.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people remained on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they became victims," said the representative of the Indonesian agency for the disaster mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, dragged cars, trees, houses, broke everything on the ground,” explained Nugroho and added that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
He said a few people climbed a tree to escape a tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in the 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crash agency show destroyed buildings and shops, bent and broken bridges and water - surrounded moše.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In the area with 2.4 million people, they felt a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy released in a strong earthquake is about 200 times the force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "independence" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that some victims' bodies were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and added 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be greater along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely interrupted and do not have any information from the Donggal area.
“There are over 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers head for affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunami hit Pale, but officials say the waves came just at the time of issuing a warning.
On the amateur video posted on social networks, it sounds like a man upstairs is yelling at people on the street on the upcoming tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall crashed along the coast and brought with them buildings and cars.
They couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording at Reuters' house.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused the loss of electricity, which broke off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo planes with the aid of Djakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still require much food and other basic life supplies.
The City Airport was only opened to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Wido is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The victim in an Indonesian tsunami increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Achievements, members of the World Vision organization from Donggal arrived safely in Pale, where employees in the courtyard set up shelters from tarpaulins, but on their way they saw numerous scenes of devastation.
“I was told they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when disaster relief groups launched an initiative, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great experience do not allow their arrival in Pale.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, cross-border financing, stocks and assistance to personnel shall be permitted only if the crash site is declared to be a national accident area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross, is still considered an accident at the province level.”
"When the government says "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can accept international aid, but this status is not yet there."
The other night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of missing persons are holding on to hope that their close wonders are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the lifeguards released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days, along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian ship’s representative, trained two missing sailing boats for Asian games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The others, trapped in Ro Ro Ro Ro, were, according to Mr. Mandaggi, his students.
"As an age in the field of sailing, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers how, in an hour when the news of the collapse of the Roo Roo Hotel was circulated across the community of sailors, he was desperate to send messages to the application WhatsApp contestants in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one grey hook, instead of two wise ones.
“I think this means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
The thieves stole $26.750 while filling the ATM in the Newport centre on the Levee
According to a report by the Newport police, the thieves stole $26.750 on Friday morning to a Brink Security Service worker who filled a ATM in the Newport Center on the Leeve.
The car driver emptyed a ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing for the delivery of money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man "accompanied to an employee security service Brink" from behind" and stole a bag of money for his delivery.
According to reports, the witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants involved in the event.
Anyone with information on suspects' identity should call the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The text was sent on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: "A creature with the official name Kanye West."
A 41-year-old West named Ye for some time, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is scheduled to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace Ariano granda, who resigned for "personal reasons", said the show maker.
The word is shortening his current professional name, and West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think that “ye” is the most widely used word in the Bible, where “you” (i.e.),” West said at the beginning of this year when he talked about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“ So that I am you and I am all.
Kanye, meaning “one”, I turned to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
Album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rapists who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his wish for the names Love and Brother Love.
He also used his name differently from a former West Associate, JAY-Z; he thoughtfully or without his name and capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use an army against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obordor swore never to use a military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in the Tlatelolco Plaza market that he would never use an army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements started operating in Latin America, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people in peaceful demonstrations on the market on 2 October 1968.
Lopez Obordor has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide students with monthly subsidies and to open up several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal groups.
US should double financing of artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds it uses to explore this area, a true investor and expert on artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after the different parts of the American government predicted the use of artificial intelligence, even though the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: their goal is to become the best innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The adoption of the budget for research by artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are considerable to the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence would take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Supersile artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order) published the publishing house Hoaughton Misourt, president of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most visible companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a system of artificial intelligence that beat the top American player of the Othello game, and later he was the CEO of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous American Government Technology Competitions, such as the robotics competition organised by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when it would be easier to find the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States need to work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes over the best academics, it's businesses," Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked best from universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that people with a doctorate from artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese National Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China's National Foundation for Natural Science funds people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, to distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, while the White House announced the establishment of a narrow Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, however, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of two billion USD.
National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, American legislation, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything in months.
Macedonians will decide at referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum whether to change their country's name to "Northern Macedonia's Republic". This would resolve decades of long conflict with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the Government concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum and the boycott campaign doubted that the participation would be at least 50 per cent absent as long as the referendum needed to be valid.
The issue of the referendum paper read: “Are you a member of NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that were created after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
I came today to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgiska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote that will be decisive.
The amendment of the name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 13:00.
However, participation was only 16% compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our town is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an electorate from Skopje’s capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son, Duško, submitted their votes for a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership in NATO will bring the very necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the great majority will be for as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zave said after the broadcast of his electoral list.
He added that the result would be a positive "confirmation of our future".
The survey, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, showed that a referendum would be attended between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters, which is less than necessary electoral participation.
A second survey by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent would vote in favour.
In order to succeed in the referendum, voting participation must be 50% plus one vote.
The failed referendum would mean the first more serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government, which took office last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City faked the entire Brighton Defense and won
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense on Saturday at the stadium of Ethad in Manchester City with 2-0.
Aguire's goal in 65 minutes seemed ridiculously simple.
At the start of the campaign, the Argentine attacker accepted a midfield show.
He ran among three Brighton's defence players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defensive player and was faster than others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he handed Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in criminal space, the English attacker returned the ball to Aguer, who defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right leg and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
“Aguero is facing problems in his legs,” said the journalist City coach Pep Guardiola.
«We have agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have a goal at that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the blues the initial advantage in the fight of the first English League.
He scored the goal in 29 minutes.
In this action Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's half.
On the left side, the ball gave a nice hand to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times, then sent the team to the remote gate.
The blue-son attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it came down.
On Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, in the group part of the League champions, henfenheim.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and spoil their address options
The Nationals team is out of play, so there's no reason for a new attack.
But always the competitive Scherzer hopes he can climb up to the greeks against the Colorado Rockies team on Sunday. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the chance to play in the game, as in the Western League we have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
The Rockies provided the least invitation to the organiser on Friday with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals team, but still waiting for their first address in division.
"Although we can't win anything, at least we'll be able to play in an excellent atmosphere in front of a large crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at the likely highest level this year.
So why wouldn't you want to compete?"
Nationals haven't published the name of the first ball Sunday, but in this case, it's probably going to be a metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be so first metal for 34, is on Thursday metal as a relief player and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington right-hander collected 18 wins this season and 7 losses with an average of 2.53 and 300 removal from impact in 220 2/3 exchange this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
The president directly touched the situation regarding his choice of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican election participation in mid-elections.
"All we have done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I'm really trying to be a candidate, so I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, and this is happening now.
They're determined to regain power, using every resource possible, and you can see rudeness, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go after, get strength and control, because that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
According to him, the democrats are on the mission of "refoulement and obstacle".
"And you could see this in the last four days," he said and named the Democrats as "hot, mean, low and lying".
In particular, he highlighted a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, with loud disapproval being heard from the audience.
»Remember her answer?
Have you published a document?
Hmm, hmm, what.
No, um, no, no, wait. It was a really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Laburistic Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When Momentum's activist told me about a mistrust in my local client, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last member of parliament from the Labour Party, which is not desirable for expressing my opinion.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan did something similar because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, there was a motion of distrust for my dissatisfaction with Jeremy Corby.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe. Ironlike issues Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders on.
In its notice of Friday, a meeting of the Labour Party Nottingham East said that “We want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
During the eight years that I am a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, the Friday Meetings were mostly exactly the same.
Unfortunately, during most meetings today, such a tone is not used and the promise of a "friendlyer and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly obvious that the various views in the Labour Party are not admissible and in each opinion whether this is acceptable to the management of the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, and the colleagues I previously thought we share similar political views expected me to change my opinion and take up positions that I would otherwise never agree with — whether in the field of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly — and in fact, it doesn’t matter what I say — there are criticisms on social networks that call for non-election, condemn policy in the middle and tell me that it should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because there are only political comments for me.
I admire the professionality and determination of those colleagues who daily encounter a flood of sexist or racist insults, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most unfortunate aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with each proposal of distrust or change the rules for customer selection is becoming more narrower.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to bend my head and not to be so loud, but I will be "all right".
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, the negligence of Tacher’s government has been a matter of literally crashing down at my primary school — I as a local councilman or government minister, tried to advocate better public services for those who need it most.
I've never kept my political beliefs hidden, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East could be confused by my political positions and areas I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal Friday, I would simply like to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is heading towards a bank that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud that I have served you, and I promise you that no threat after the lack or political appropriateness will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Ajr non-moved to the top of the scale
Two well-known experiments have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned a victory in this wonderful championship game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the scale and they're the only unbeatable team out of ten.
In the end, the scale on the home side sprung over their top defenses and better exploitation of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for contentment.
"In our competitions so far, we have passed a lot of tests and we are still unstoppable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations of the Ayra team, opportunities were used better than we did.”
The score of Grant Anderson within 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, was Ayr led the lead, but the yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the game with the Warriors, meant a number of strengths for Melrose and Jason Baggott had intercepted an attempt without conversion.
Climo increased leadership for Ayr in the course of the offence before he hit at halftime and then converted a standalone attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose was very good at starting the second half, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, who was converted by Baggot, reduced his backward to five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott carried on the stretchers, and Ayr progressed with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
The temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPherspoon then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the game with the player more with an unturned attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to an obstacle to Clima without a ball, MacPherson achieved a hit in the attack.
He was a member of the United States of America, and he was a member of the United States of America.
Still Game Series Star starts new career in catering
The Still Game Ford Kieran series star is obviously in the catering area, at least becoming the director of licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, played Jack Jarvis along with a longtime partner in the comedy Greg Hemphill.
Two announced that after the last season of the ninth season, Kiernan seemed to be planning a life in Craiglang.
According to official documentation, Adriftmorn Limited is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player didn't want to comment on the story, but the source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be included in the "flower hospitality" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the Court will again open its way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
naval blue flags are being invented in public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titikak to Amazon are covered with slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of coastline in a blood dispute due to natural resources from Chile in the 19th century is still alive — like longing after the respite through the Pacific.
This hope may now be greatest after decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the international court, which will be received after five years of consultations on 1 October.
“The disease has momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course in a positive spirit awaits the result,” said Roberto Calzadila, a Bolivian diploma.
Many Bolivians will look at the international court's decision on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia, which insists it must – after decades of unsettling talks – negotiate on the access of Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, the Bolivian charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has great expectations for Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” promised the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favor of Bolivia — and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to assign to Bolivia Chilean territory and will not decide on the outcome of any discussions.
The fact that the international court's decision comes only six months after hearing final arguments means that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, they haven't spoken in favor of Bolivia, but maybe they'll cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the question of access to the sea,” said Záratej.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric was pierced by Chile’s all-good will, which may have remained, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to participate in discussions.
The states have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had unusually quickly taken a decision.
In Monday, Bolivia will bring a "extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the possibility of ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadila also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — used the maritime issue as a political support.
“The disease will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea declares nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his people will never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States has called on them to fulfil their promises made at a meeting between the leaders of the rival states in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Minister Mike Pompeo is obviously before the relaunch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead point, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is wrong to think that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the announcement of the end of the Korean war of North Korea will lead North Korea to their knees.
Washington is cautious when attaching the forecast without first taking decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, there is a general doubt that Pyongyang is seriously concerned about the failure of the arms that the country sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris revealed the latest line of huge roofs that come to the market with affordable brands in your vicinity
If you want to complete your collection of covers or hide completely from the sun, you do not need to look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a collection of strange overcoats in their Spring and Summer 2019 collections that blinded the style of the Paris Week mode.
Very impractical coverings have overrun Instagram this summer, and designers have sent their spectacular creations to fashion.
Valentine's piece, which stood out most, was a hat in a beige color with a wide area decorated with feathers-like accessories in which the heads of models were completely lost.
Other excessive fashion accessories include watermelons with expensive stones, a magic hat, and even ananas – but your head will not warm up.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of pearl masks – just a good time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to breathing and glasses diving equipment, while the other looked like a coroner with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predict that the giant roof will come to the shops near you.
The wide hats are closely followed by "La Bombi", a straw hat with 60-cent-metre sites, among other things, were observed in Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
A cultural brand for an extremely impractical hat that has overrun social networks has sent another large creation – a straw bag for a beach that was almost as large as a model in a bathing suit.
The raft bag in the burnt orange colour, coated with rye and white leather cuts, was at the Paris Week mode central piece of the collection La Riviera designer Jachemsa for spring/summer 2019.
The Stylist of famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive in the shop for the next summer – because the designer made such an impression, it would be difficult to ignore the request for over-adjustments.”
John Edward: language skills is crucial for global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of remarkable test results that are further reinforced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Single School Council (SCIS), strive to ensure the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the place they hold as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a tailored school programme, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he is impressed with the conversation.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, his words are put in his heart."
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results from recent examinations show that languages at the top of the scale are with the highest level of performance in single schools.
68 percent of students learning a foreign language achieved an excellent assessment.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of pupils achieved an excellent mark in Mandarin, and 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages shall be treated as a selective subject in the teaching plans of single schools and elsewhere as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The study carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that, on the grounds for which employers are struggling to fill job vacancies, 17 per cent can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their careers.
For future job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 survey of YouGov, which included more than 4000 adults in the UK, showed that 75% of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to talk, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that is 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for children today.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have better chances of finding a proper job.
In Scotland schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others are teaching languages that are supposed to be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Regardless of your child’s interest, many languages taught by experts in this field will always be possible in single schools.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of a country, and this must therefore also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien only faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Single Schools
LeBron's gonna debut Sunday in San Diego in Lakers' play
For fans who look forward to LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakes team, the wait will be over soon.
Coach Lakers' Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's opening match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48,” explains Walton on the official website of the Lakes Team.
The official rapporteur for the Lakers Mike Trudell team wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers games before the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need a race before the season,” he said.
Trump's convention in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump, today in Wheeling, West Virginia, is launching a series of conventions in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings in the coming week, including stops in his favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As his candidate for a post at the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as it threatens the Republicans to lose control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s convention in West Virginia be held at, and where will it be available online?
Trump's convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 19.00 a.m. Eastern time.
Trump’s convention in West Virginia can be watched live online on YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to be talking about the hearings of the candidate for Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh this week, which has become tense over sexual assault charges, which is why confirmation in the senate is expected to be postponed for a week in order for the FBI to carry out the investigation.
However, the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help the Republicans, who are awaiting significant elections in November, gain a new momentum.
This is why in President Trump's campaign, the five conventions were "promoting volunteers and supporters, because Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
“Training in Congress is so important to his programme that the President will travel to as many countries as possible during the difficult season of campaigning,” said the representative Trumja of a campaign that does not want to be named.
Today's convention at the Wesbanco Arena Center in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania following the report by West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract the interest of drinking media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit Western Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received over 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public research.
»For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the President must come and “speak it” in public research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, after reporting.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team still wants to win and keeps hope ahead of Sunday's individual fights
After three one-sided games, perhaps the afternoon fights of two twins (foursome) were what Ryder's Cup needed this year.
The niche is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where's the rainstorm going now?
"They had six points of advantage, but now they have four, so this is probably a new momentum for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course, because it leads to four points and twelve can win them.
But the Americans, according to Spieth's words, feel that the winds in the sails have, and among other things, they were encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each won three points of four.
Spieth was fatal from the initial blow to the greenery and set a good example.
The cries of happiness continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and his parents, after two points behind, same in the fourth game.
The strike that brought them victory on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that makes you know that he believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You must find your inner strength and focus on your game,” said Spieth.
That's all that's left to these players.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
It is unusual, but Europe's charming twin has won four points of four and are inexplicable.
The "Mullywood" double was the only one that didn't hit the boogie on Saturday afternoon, while the boogies avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and a way in which the energy between them and the lurch audience seems to be running out, confirm the fact that they are those players who have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could be better able to seal any victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun hits the Le Golf National field.
Perhaps both at the same time on different holes.
But talking about the European Glory would be interrupted.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergi Garcio, a morning hero in a four-ball game with Alex Noren.
Because of the boogie and two double boogies in the first nine holes, the Spanish and Sweden fell into a crisis where they couldn't find a way out.
On Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and two fights are interestingly followed close by communication between couples, advice they give each other, and a way in which the strategy can change at a moment.
Europe has played better than a team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the two twins have shown that the US team also has a desire for victory, which some, in particular on the US side, doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a good advantage after having four ball games on Saturdays and two fights with 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple, made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, made his best of himself and with two victories over Tiger Woods and on Le Golf National's field, traded four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorna, who was trying to win the trophy she lost two years ago in Haseltin, had enough to do in her morning games with four balls over the American team that sinned and she said in a series of 3-1.
The U.S. team fought better in two fights, which won two games, but the rest couldn't catch up.
The Jim Fury team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 separate fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari were called "Moliwood" after the sensational end of the week, only the second couple who won four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After winning Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then turned out to be more convincing and defeated by the spent Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at moments, but lost 19 of 29 games in four balls and two fights, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning games with four balls, returned for the two doubles and in pair with Henri Stanson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who are ranked first and third place on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, it didn't go as far as Europe's team's plans.
Three-time winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they fought decisively against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four ball game and then returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the fights of two twins, losing the first two holes.
Just once in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned after four points were lagging behind before individual fights, although Fury's team only needs equalization to preserve the trophy.
After two days in another place, however, the Sunday attack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: "No confidence will we in no way disarm one-sided" · Global Voices
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that further enforcement of sanctions caused increasing distrust in the United States and that under such conditions North Korea would certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Body, Ri Jong Ho said that in the past year North Korea has taken a number of "important measures to the sign of good faith", such as halting nuclear and missile attempts, subsidizing the city for nuclear experiments and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see the appropriate US response," he said.
"We will not be confident of national security in the United States, and under such conditions we will not be unilaterally disarmed first."
While Rhesus reiterated the known complaints from North Korea regarding the resistance to Washington to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Djong Una and Donald Trump from the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June. At that time Kim made a commitment to pursue the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump of North Korea promised security assurances.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pingjang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not back down the calls to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“The United States insists that we need to disarm ourselves first and step up pressures with sanctions in order to achieve their goals by force and even object to the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri reported.
“When he thinks that sanctions could get us on our knees, it is the unrealistic hope of people who don’t even know us.
However, the problem is that further implementation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the US President at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jže Inom, which took place over the past five months, adding: “If we had not talked to South Korea and not the United States about the problem of nuclear disarmament, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not agree at such a dead point.”
However, the tone of Rija's speech was completely different from that last year when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the US continental region with North Korean missiles was inevitable, after the "economic evil president" Trump Kima was designated as a "cancer man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to "perfectly destroy" North Korea, commended the United Nations Assembly Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said he was waiting for much more work and that sanctions should remain valid until North Korea disarms itself.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no planned timeframe for this, saying: “The situation can be two years, three years or five months – that does not matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should be rewarded by Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council Thursday: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue decisively without exception until we recognise the complete, definitive and verified state of nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent funding from North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the General Assembly of the United Nations and later said that Pyongyang will again visit next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not ended well.
As he left Pyongyang in July, he declared that progress had taken place, and North Korea had already criticised him within hours of being considered to be his "gangst" demands.
At its meeting with the moon of this month, North Korea has committed itself to subsisting the station for rocket testing and nuclear testing infrastructure if the United States is to take "adequate measures".
Mün was supposed to say that the "adequate measures" meant the security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take sufficient time to rest
The new Harvard University course this year aims to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight the growing macho culture of the "complete" learning, where the power is collected with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s highest university often do not know the basics of care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, has developed a course according to his first such species in the United States.
He decided to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, "Why do I know this only now that I'm in the last year?"
She said that no one has ever told her how important sleep is, and that the Daily Telegraph, the professor told her that it surprised him.
This year's course speaks of the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sporting success as well as improving general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services, says that this was the course they decided when they found that students were significantly lacking sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the student home door where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep shortages on the sporting success and importance of sleep routine.
In the second section, participants find that a long-term lack of sleep may increase the risk of cardiac arrests, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that the behaviour of students will not immediately change.
But we believe they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health affects smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
Professor says that the culture of pride is still present when it comes to “lived universal learning”. It also adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, present growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that sufficient amount of quality sleep should be "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. This can also avoid gaining weight – the brain, due to lack of sleep, shift into a way of hunger, which makes students constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California chemical and physical biology student Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to design a course. Last year a professor attended a lecture during the first year of Harvard.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that in the next phase, postgraduate students will be able to ask to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a sleep alarm as well as a wake-up. He would also like to warn them of the harmful effects of “moderate light” radiated by electronic displays and LED lighting, as it may cause circadian rhythm imbalances, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit of the Gerrard Hope Team
Rangers again defeated in the guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston the notified team Steven Gerrard condemned to defeat by 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team has been after its first guest victory after the February superpower at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4:1, but Gary Holt's team has given her another defeat in 18 matches since the Gerrard team's head, with his team as the leading team of the Scottish League behind 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected rangers did not give the impression that she wanted to equalise.
With this rangers fell to a frequent town, and Livingston progressed to third place, but the difference between goal was behind the team Hibernian.
Calum Spence, by side judge, suffered a head injury when he was reported to fly an object from the place of the cheerleading team.
In the crew, Gerrard beat Ayr with no difficulty and joined the semifinals of the Betfried Cup Cup Cup, finished eight shifts.
On the other hand, Holt held onto the verified 11th of Livingston, which took the team Hears item the week before, and undoubtedly was delighted with how his run-off team effectively neutralized all attempts of guests.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short show, then went to the goal of Allan McGregor, but he was a typologist in the execution of an inexplicable and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot by Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halket, but the ball then his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow was unable to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after the crash with Steven Lawless, after 15 minutes of the match, a criminal shot had to be delivered, but Judge Steven Thomson had to put the Colombian in the weapons.
The Rangers first half managed to draw only two shots to the goal, but not a shot to the head, sent to the naked by Lassana Coulibaly, nor the younger ball of Ovie Ejar, they did not pose any danger to the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston’s introductory goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everything, but he was already completely earned because of his perseverance.
The Rangers failed to book another Jacobs attachment with a long show.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who was routinely preparing Mengi for an easy ending of the attack.
Gerrard acted and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent's wingman, who immediately proved himself to be Morelos, but Kelly ran effectively off his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and guests forced him to play, with Lithgowe and Halket taking care of several flights before the goal.
Holt's team could increase the lead to the end of the match, but McGregor was effectively neutralized by Jacobs, and then Lithgow was untruthed by the angle show.
In the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the opportunity to shoot the criminal after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't admit it.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
We are presenting a page from the almanah of our Sunday editions: 30 September 1882, which is today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger counter.
It has become permanent in the scientific world, and its city has also been created in pop culture, for example in the film "Bells of Coronado" since 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Men: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: »This is Geiger’s counter. It is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can also hear the effect on the atoms of radioactivity in materials.”
Evans: "Madonca, now they're really answering!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only days before 63rd birthday.
The invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify the attack cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to identify and destroy attack cells
In the course of therapy, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify the attack cells.
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of a patient who is then converted into a laboratory
After that, they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of a number of cancers, then they are returned to the patient.
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women receiving the vaccine, who learns the immune system to identify the attack cells, cancer on the ovaries disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells by patients who are converted into a laboratory to be able to “see” HER2 protein, which is characterized by a number of cancer forms and then re-inject.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Research Institute from Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promoting the growth of several different types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to obtaining the immune cells of patients who are “teaching” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West performed a protection post with MAGA on the stroke after the concert at SNL.
The public was not impressed
Kanye West was radiated at the Saturday Night Live studio at a strange point, during which he expressed his support to US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the Presidential chair.
He has been playing with a third song of his performance, called Ghost Town, during which he held a hat with the inscription "Mike America Great Again", West launched an attack on democrats and reiterated his support to Trump.
“I often talk to a white person, and he says to me, “How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?”
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” she says.
This episode of SNL began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood player was deranged from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Justice Commission in the Senate, accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault.
The recording of West's monologue wasn't released, but it was loaded on social networks by Chris Rock's comet.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of him from West.
Among other things, West complained that he had some problems with the inscription on the hat in his back.
"They went after the stage for me.
They told me “not to go on stage with this hat. ”
I've been harassed!
And they say I'm lost," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the lost scene?” and added that it must wear the “Sutoman cape, because that means no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.”
His comments were prepared at least twice to the whistle, and members of the SNL team were in obvious distress, and someone told Vanity: “In the studio there was a death silence.”
At the last moment, Westa invited goats to replace Ariano Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The West has produced many wonders already with a video track for the song "I Love It", where it has worn a costume of the mineral water bottle of the Perrier brand.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: HVALA, TO BE UPPRL RAJI."
And Karen Hunter, the director of the conversation show, tweeted that West was simply “what it is, and that’s fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (with the purchase of his music, clothing, or with the support of his “art”), which in my opinion welcomes and extends an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we also,” she added.
Before the show, rapper published on Twitter that he changed his name and will be "bit, formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE."
He's not the first musician who's decided to change his name.
His partner, Snoop Dogg, was once called Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: Prince turned his name into a symbol, and then he was an artist, once known as Prince.

Kit Harington's playoff star to toxic menstrude
Kit Harington is known for his inspiration as Jonah Snow in HBO's exciting medievally colored series of plays of thrones.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a machete hero says that because of the appearance of such roles on screens young boys often feel that respect can only be earned with strength.
For the magazine The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought something was going wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic menhood during the period #Isake.
A player recently married a 31-year-old teammate from the Rose Leslie Game admitted that he had strong convictions on this subject.
"I'm particularly serious right now about where we made a mistake when it comes to manhood," he said.
"What did we teach men about the difficulties we are currently facing while growing up?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic menhood to show very manly images.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What are we taught on TV and on the streets that young boys feel like they have to choose the right side of menhood?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change that?
Because apparently there was something wrong with young men."
In an interview, he also said that after the end of the next summer series, he would not participate in the recording of any pre-election or continuation of the Games of Thrones because he had "closed with fights and horses".
In November, Kit will play in the main role of the new True West Sam Shepherd performance, which is the story of the film producer and his brother's robbery.
The player recently revealed that the best thing that ever happened to the Games of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose at the shooting.
"For this series, I met my wife, so she gave me a way of giving me my future family and life from here," he said.
Rose was in a fantasy series awarded by Amy, played by Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character Jonah Snow.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 850,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has changed with sexual relations, which is a change compared to the past.
Usually HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials from a conference in the province of Juan, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost nothing.
Still, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing annually by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV with sexual intercourse in the Chinese community LGBT is a very burning problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against persons from the LGBT community is still very much present.
Since conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the GOC has promised general access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have issued information on Republican senators, condemns "hazard lies" and "false theory"
On Saturday, US Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected allegations that a member of her staff had published information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A democrat from Los Angeles claimed these charges were coming from individuals and websites of the extreme right.
"The lies, lies and more inadmissible lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes, according to the information, domestic addresses and telephone numbers of US senators, Lindsay Graham, South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hutch from Utah State.
These data appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person with the Boyle Hill, during the Senate's session on charges of sexual harassment of the candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Kanough.
The leaking information occurred after the three senators completed the Kavanaugh hearing.
Conservative websites, such as Glement Pundit and RedState, state that the IP address is able to identify the source of publication that is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters' office and conclude that the information was published by one of the staff, still reports Hill.
“These unfounded accusations are completely wrong and pure lies” continues Waters.
"My employees whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false charges are in no way responsible for the leaking of this data.
These unfounded accusations are absolutely false and pure lies."
The statement by Senator Watersov quickly came across criticism online, including the former White House representative, Ari Fleischer.
"From this he denies the limbs of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This could mean there's no real congress test.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the man who accused him.
It must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for the City of Waters in mid-election, came in via Twitter.
"If that's true, it's serious," he hung up.
In her statement, Waters stated that her cabinet had informed “adequate law enforcement institutions and bodies with regard to these false accusations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
Searching for clues to Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and is also valid for revitalizing the Johnny English action come on screen for the first time in 2003 entitled Johnny English and continuing in 2011 entitled Johnny English 2.
Will there be a fun satire about how terrible we are, a new export opportunity for us?
The uncompatible Johnny English, with its sculpted eyes and unusual grimas, is allowed to remarriate the stumps; its name already indicates that it is a comic figure created for cinematographic audiences in non-English speaking areas.
It is an awkward secret agent who, despite his clear gestures, contains part of Clouseau, little Mr. Bean, and little by little, has contributed the last notation Chariots of Fire to the ceremony at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a traveller and an international mystery man, once played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten TV advertising for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real chaos.
One or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, he was wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor's leaves were short on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for the comedy is clearly displayed, but humor seems a bit mild and excessively unnecessary, especially because "serious" films, like 007 or Mission, are impossible now without a bad conscience, offer comic elements.
It seems that humor is intended for children and not so many adult viewers, and that is why, for me, the choices of Johnny Englisha are not as innovative and targeted as Atkinson's niche as Mr Bean.
The permanent theme is now evident that Britain is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the online network of British most secret agents and revealed the identity of all British agents, causing great difficulties to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the point of a break for a prime minister, a pompous figure, which has already suffered a break because of political unlovingness: Emma Thompson, though, has done her best to play the role of supposed Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the scenario to help her.
The Intelligence Service informs her that all active spies are exposed, so she has to decide for one of the retired spies.
And this means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prominent school that is informally teaching how to operate under cover: here are the writers hit, because English is performing some kind of spying' rock academy.
English takes her to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where she meets a longtime associate named Bowen, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the submarine commander, the stereotype sports enthusiast, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine is losing a little bit.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems in the name of the secret service of her Majesty, and meet the Fatalko of Ophelio Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister goes dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and Bough begin their ossey: dressed in the natuckar put fire in a French restaurant, create chaos when they reach the deck of Volt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for virtual reality to meet the interior of Volt's house, it manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite sympathies and energisms, it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can't help it here and I think: is the British film Atkinson able to play a role that actually justifies his talent?
Laburies deny that Britance is planning a four-day working week, and they would receive payment for a five-day working week.
The Laburistic party, Jeremy Corby, is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a payment for five days.
A party of business leaders wants the savings generated by companies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to be passed on to workers and to provide them with an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say the idea corresponds to the customer's economic plan and plans to put the country on the side of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is the way workers take advantage of the advantages of the changing economy.
The source from the Labour Party stated for The Sunday Times: 'The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-week working party is the goal that we will seek to achieve through the customer's approach to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as it supported the Green Party for a four-week working week in its 2017 campaign.
At present, however, this objective is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "four weeks of work is not a party policy and the party does not think about it."
John McDonell's shadow Chancellor used a Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonell said that he was determined to take out the power of "unfortunate directors" and "profitmakers" in municipal companies.
Shadow Chancellor plans also mean that the current stakeholders in the water-water companies may not regain full share, as the Labour Party could impose "refuss" on the grounds of alleged injustices.
It also approved plans for the inclusion of workers in boards of directors and for the establishment of the Equity Integration Fund, thereby transferring 10% of the share in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the show "60 Minutes" (“60 Minutes”) whether their opinion could change the Cavanaugh investigation carried out by the FBI.
The investigation of charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on his appointment in the Supreme Court for at least one week and has raised the question whether the findings of the Office of any Republican senator could convince him to withdraw his support to the judge.
In an interview carried on Sunday, the correspondent submitted a "60 Minutes" to Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham asking if the FBI could detect anything that would change her opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a fellow from South Carolina.
“I think, of course,” Kennedy said.
»Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this indictment came up, I asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, careless, unequivocal."
And Graham's voice appears to be carved into stone.
»I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would need a very convincing reason to change it," he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied it,” said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
»And he could not confirm it any of the ones she called
The case is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and does it contribute to reducing poverty in any way?
This Saturday, New York will host a Global Citizens Festival, a annual musical event involving a truly remarkable set of stars, which has the same extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held this week for the seventh time, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. The Grand Trale of Central Park will be held not only to enjoy the performances of musicians, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest for the real purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocate group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for an event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, letter to the world leader, phone call or any other meaningful way of increasing awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How, though, is the movement of Global Citizen that remains for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to ask for action, or is this just another example of the so-called "cliticism" – creating the belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation by signing an online petition or forwarding a tweet?
The Global Citizen Movement states that more than 19 million "acts" of its supporters should be recorded in efforts towards a range of different objectives since 2011.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to accept commitments and policies worth more than USD 37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early 2018 period, the group stated that its activities were to bear the result of 390 commitments and communications, on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are strength of nutrition (The Power of Nutrition), investor partnership and decision-makers committed to “inflicted children to realise their full potential”, which have promised the Rwandai 35 million dollars in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving over 4700 tweets of movement to global citizens.
“By supporting the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens such as yourself, we can put social injustices into historical archives,” said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of the Power Food Partnership, a crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out, the government called on the United Kingdom to improve mother and child nutrition, announced that it would co-finance the Power Diet project, which will reach 5 million women and children through food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
the movement of the global citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fail and will fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Among some performers who will perform at this year's event in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardiff B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness in Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy - the US Ministry of Interior for Russian energy exports
According to a report by Washington Examiner, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said Washington Examiner could use a Navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, among other things in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it is necessary to make an excuse to explore new energy markets at the invitation of the legitimate government.
"I believe that their presence in the Middle East is a desire for energy marketing, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," I should say.
However, according to the administrator, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The united countries can do this. The Navy makes sure that our maritime routes are open and block them, if necessary, to prevent Russian energy from leaking into the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to participants in an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group called the US "power consumers voice".
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, stressing that it was actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less affecting fuel and replacing them,” he said, marking Russia as a “pot that knows one trick”, with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were issued at a time when Trump's administration sought to increase its LNG exports to Europe, where it was intended to push Russia, a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trumof Government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the "inappropriate" gas pipeline project North Stream 2, which, after Trump Berlin's "teacher" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy must not be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after the September meeting with US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the American position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral arrangements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Integrating a third country into our energy supply means a great problem for me”, said Dieter Kempov, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly examine" her candidate in the elections for the US President in 2020, a true Massachusett Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "exactly examine" her candidate for the US president after the mid-term elections.
Warren's office in Holyokeu, Massachusetts, confirmed that she would consider the candidate.
"It is time to go to Washington women and correct our corrupt government, which requires a female leader," she said after reporting the newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine my candidate for president closely."
Warren's meeting in the city house was rewarded by President Donald Trump because "this country is supposed to lead the wrong way."
“What Donald Trump does to our democracy, I’m terribly worried,” she said.
Warrenov has already openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the President of the Bret Kavanaugh Supreme Court several times.
On Friday's tweet, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the elections."
The survey, published on Thursday, however, showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not compete for the position of the president in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk Policy Research Centre/Timescription Boston Globe, the senator should not be running for president eighty-five percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts.
Thirty-two percent of its bid would support them.
The survey showed that it has more support for the former Governor Daval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of respondents being supported and 48 per cent being opposed.
Other senior democrats, who would be eligible for candidates in the 2020 elections, are former vice-president Joe Biden and senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
After reporting to Associated Press, Biden said he would formally decide by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at the meeting in support of Donald Trump
The song was written in 1898 and was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son experiences after his return is connected with other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain amount of hurt that our soldiers are returning,” said the audience at a meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's son's arrest was marked "the elephant in the salon" and said that her son and the other war veterans were returning slightly changed, hardheaded, questionable, where is the respect for what fellowmen and flyers and all other members of the army donated to the country."
Tracka Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of violence in the family by assaulting a woman, an obstacle to the declaration of violence in the family and possession of weapons in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla Police Station.
18 federal and Colombian countries support the deployment of new asylum policies
Eighteen federal states and the District of Colombia support the legal rejection of the new US policy, which escapes victims of violence against gangs or domestic violence, denys the right to asylum.
The NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district mentioned on Friday filled the judicial lobby in order to support the legal discard of the policy.
The entire name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Union for Civil Liberties against the Federal Policy, has not been published.
She said that her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang”, were abused, but the US authorities rejected her asylum claim on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors of the federal states supporting Grace described the issue of gangs and domestic violence as the countries constantly coping with the problem of gangs and violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy repealed the decision of the Committee on the Calls for Migrants, which is an undetected immigrant who flees from violence within the family, allowed asylum applications to be submitted.
Public prosecutor of the Columbia District, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that a new policy "regards decades of state, federal and international law".
“Framework law requires all asylum requirements to be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition infringes this principle,” states the requested court.
Public prosecutors further stated in the request that a policy which denies immigrants' right of entry is damaging the American economy, as they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provid the necessary workforce".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions has ordered the immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or political opinion," said the Sesions on 11 June in his publication of a policy.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palum has doubled, but desperate attempts are under way to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said 35-year-old Mother Risa Kusuma, when she comforted her hot boy at the evacuation center in the decommissioned city of Pal.
"The paramedics constantly supply the bodies.
Clean water is lacking."
It seemed to be citizens, returning to destroyed homes, which were pierced through the so - called things and tried to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered damage to the back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outdoorly for continuous severe earthquake shocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake, which shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was housed with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to get out.
I think it squeezed me against the ruins of the walls," Harris told the agency Associated Press. He added that he was with his family in town because of the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador charges China's "disabling" with "propaganda ads"
A week after the publication of the four-party newspaper of the official Chinese newspaper in the American journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the USA and China, US Ambassador to China Peking accused U.S. press abuses of spreading propaganda.
Last Sunday, US President Donald Trump mentioned a paid addition to the China Daily newspaper in the Des Mines Register newspaper – the most sold newspaper in the State of Iowa, after China accused of interference in the US congress election on 6 November, which China denies.
The Reuters Agency reported that the US Federal Officers Trump's indictment that Beijing tried to interfere with the American federal elections was described as a new phase in all Washington's intensive efforts to push China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently complicated in an ever-increasing trade war, in which they exchange punches by introducing customs duties on import products.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to affect exporters in the federal states, such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in Sunday's edition of the newspaper Des Mines Register, "now this harassment is misleading by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the appreciated American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in the Des Mines Register newspaper,” wrote Branstad.
“On the other hand, you will see few other opinions and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions of Chinese citizens about China’s worrying economic path, as it is strictly controlled by China’s Communist party,” he wrote.
He added that he "one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected an offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose ballots before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts point out that despite several charges of sexual assault, the support of many of the most important Republicans, who support and defend candidate for Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh, will know about the upcoming interim elections with loss of vote.
Feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue to vote.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Sirakuzah, for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that the pressure from Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to contain angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow and even November not," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced MoveOn group, on Friday, after the report by the newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang “November Coming!” when demonstrated in the Chamber’s hall, when Republicans controlling the judicial board decided to continue supporting the Kavanaugh appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, the news portal of Mik was reported.
"The excitement and motivation of democrats will go beyond the limits," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they are already strong, and that is true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among unspecified voters in suburbs and young voters aged 18-29, who do not like the president but do not often vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, describing in detail her allegations of sexual assault by the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This became a big mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, according to NBC News’s report early last week.
"It's not just the voting of the world or the final vote or the Kavanaugh oath; it's also the way Republicans deal with it and how Ford was dealt with," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, who supported democrats in the elections.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided between whether they believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony more, with little more support from the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or most of all believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said that Kavanaugh certainly or most believed it.
In addition, 38 percent of them said that Kavanaugh was probably or probably lying during the testimony, and only 30 percent said about Ford.
After pressure from Flake FBA, he is currently investigating the charges made by Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported the newspaper The Guardian.
Ford said last week that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, had attacked her in a guilty state.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her gender when they were together at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
World Wide Web inventor intends to start a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Burners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, opens up a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of this technology legend, Inrut, is a company that builds on the Berners open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrut was meant to “rule the world”.
"We have decided to do this now," he said about a new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to enable users to create a "personal data storage storage" or sub-scene
This may contain contact details, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Similarly, as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The particularity of the personal storage storage storage is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal data recovery".
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of a company is to pool resources, processes and appropriate skills that will enable everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the volunteer project and community.
By this week, technology developers around the world could use tools available on the Inrut website to create their own decentralised applications.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "with Facebook and Google do not talk about whether they could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask them for permission."
On Saturday's publication on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee noted that Inrut »is aimed at ensuring commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet by creating a consortium of World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the following online eras,” Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Festival of Victoria's Cross from World War I · Global Voices
For 100 years in their home town, they have celebrated the award of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the English Church, which he had won as a fighter in World War I.
Lt. Bernard Vann earned recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglisa and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, a sniper shot him, and he never learned that he had been given the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, two colonels discovered a memorial stone on a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the great grandkids, Michael Vann, said that the stone was "extraordinaryly symbolic" that they discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's act to earn his distinction.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, Lieutenant Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion through the Kanala of St. Quintina "through a very dense mist and under a strong fire of the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he set out to go up against the firing line and led the line forward with the "greatest heroism" and then the machine room itself attacked and hit three members of the squad.
On 4 October 2018, Lieutenant Colonel Vann — only a good month before the war ended — shot a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of an old father were “something I know and could never achieve and therefore teach me humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, also placed a wreath on the parade led by the band of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade,” and that “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support of many people.”
The excitement of mixed martial arts was kept up all night to watch Bellator 206. Rather, the Pusses Pepe were received.
Imagine: You've been up all night to watch the completely sold Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose consisted of 13 duels including six main parks, and was carried live on channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., when Ggard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to deal with it, viewers in the United Kingdom found that the transfer had been replaced by the play of Pujs Pepa's cartoon.
A lot of people were not thrilled because he stayed awake until morning just because of a fight.
On Twitter, one of the enthusiasts described the switch to a children's cartoon as a "sick joke".
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 am, so they had to switch to the children’s programme,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Bellator Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Pep's bitch."
President of the Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule by including viewers in the UK in the future.
"When I think about replaying, I think we can sort this out," said Coker.
"But then there's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to settle this until Sunday after our time or Monday after them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a series of messages were exchanged at the switch and not everyone was nice.
We tried to sort this out; we assumed it was just a technical mistake.
However, the actual reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five duels — just as usual. We have tried to offer more than expected to the worshipers and we have learned to do so.
This is a very unappreciative situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “defless in sexual matters”.
Tom Daley, an Olympic diver, said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt less worthy than anyone — but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that "not everyone like" as he did at the time he entered high school.
In his first broadcast on Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne to radio station Radio 4, he said that he spoke about gay rights to give others "trust".
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was reduced.
A regular leader of long-standing shows, Kirsty Young, has been absent for several months.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast in the first shows of Laverne, said he felt "less worthy" than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity are the real thing that gives me strength and perseverance to achieve success. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said he would not disappoint anyone who would finally know about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic competitor has become an influential advocate of LGBT-right and has appeared twice this year on the Games of the Communities of Nations in Australia to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy to be able to speak openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “trust. ”
A three-time world champion said that he was married to a man — American film maker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he met in 2013 — “surprised.”
Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years old last year, but says that the difference in age was never a problem.
“When you are so young,” at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic Games, and three years later his father died – he said, it is hard to find someone the same age who would experience similar rises and falls.
In June, a couple adopted a child, the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that this changed his "complete view".
"If you asked me last year, all I would have to say is that "I have to reach the gold medal," he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.«
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in front.
I couldn't tell him: "This time you won't come first, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally had to admit he wasn't invulnerable," he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed about all my life – to dive into Olympic games in front of the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This was also inspired by his first song selection – The Proud of the musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games, and where his skin is still cut.
They broadcast Desert Island Discs at BBC Radio 4 station every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
The unprepared Mickelson is the Saturday Ryder Cup precedent
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday, when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to go back to form, so it won't become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for 12th time, left Captain Furyk sitting in four Saturdays.
Instead of being at the centre of events as often as it has been for the United States, five times the winner spent a day in part as a fan and partly in improving his game in order to repair what it weighs.
Since even at the height of his career, he did not measure the most straight, a 48-year-old does not fit the narrowest Le Golf National playground, where long ice inevitably punishes missed blows.
And if only the playground would not be scary enough, Mickelson will have to deal with the actual British Open Francescom Molinari Cup winner in the ninth game on Sunday, which in a leap to win in all four games this week with the new guy Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals, had less than four games, had a good start, Mickelson's game could have proved to be decisive.
Furyk expressed his trust in his man, but he didn't say much.
"He fully understands the role he played today, he hit me on the back and held me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's one of the most famous, and he's made a huge contribution to the teams in the past this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, and we thought it had to be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
Mickelson will take down Nick Fuld's record on Sunday for the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup Cup.
This could mark the conclusion of Ryder’s Cup career, which never really coincided with its own personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equals, but Furyk said that his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, funny, like to make a fool out of people and it’s great to have it in the team space,” he explained.
"I think young players have had fun trying to deal with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives a lot more than just a game.«
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon stumble
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride at the start of the last day of the games of individuals at Ryder Cup.
In 1997, the young Danec debuted on the game in Valderrama, where the site of which the captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points of advantage over the Americans, and through the goal it had only a advantage for the hair, with a result of the result of the 14th and 13th.
»Do not forget that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but barely," said Bjorn (in pictures) after seeing the Class of 2018 team, which won from 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and sang on Le Golf National from 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the cup is not over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need to do.
The competition isn't over until it's written on the board.
We have the goal of winning this cup, and we have to stay focused on it.
It has always said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are also well aware of who stands on the opposite side – the best players in the world."
Inspired by the game of his players on a challenging court, Bjorn added: “I would never get ahead of this.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow he'll be playing the game of individuals, so he'll have to do it differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, your golfer's abilities are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to pass to the players: Tomorrow you need to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he has to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the breakthroughs during the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out the "Trouble in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, delivered his players on the last day of the match.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we'd like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this momentum gets perseverance, it presses strongly on the midfield games.
We created the right setting, and we put the boys in a way, so we felt that we would do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to fight the battle and confront Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper row.
“I have decided in this group of boys to do this kind of order because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said about the selection of individuals.
New German warship resustained
The latest fragment of the German Navy should have been transferred to apply in 2014 to replace the ageing warship from the Cold War, but due to systems failure and the rapidly rising costs will not be at least until next year, local patterns have been reported.
The transfer of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the new class leader of the Fragat Baden-Württemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, the true newspaper Die Zeit, which lists the military representative.
The vessel should be joined by the Navy in 2014, but an ambitious project is being followed by worrying questions for delivery.
Four of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered in 2007, will be replaced by the ageing Bremen Fragette class.
They are expected to have a strong top, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and some cover technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer distances between maintenance – the latest frigates could be left outside the home port for up to two years.
The constant delays, however, mean that top-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to also influence the oceans, will become obsolete until the moment of application, according to the newspaper Die Ziet.
Last year, an unfortunate frigate of F125 appeared on the cover when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the shipyard after delivery.
There are few reasons for recovery, however, and the German media have provided a number of key "programme and technical shortcomings" that would make the warship useless if they referred it to a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, as Class Baden-Württemberg vessels will operate crews of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on older Bremen frigates.
It has also proven that the ship is heavy, reducing its capacity and limiting the possibility of a navy for its future upgrade.
The 7000-tonne Ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project has also become a problem — including crew training.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion vertices (EUR 3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems with recent frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
In the beginning of this year Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy actually "is short of ships suitable for posting".
The official said that the issue had increased over time because the old ships had decommissioned and the replacement vessels had not been secured.
He regretted that the Navy could not join any ship of the Baden-Württemberg class.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study is being carried out at the estate in Scotland, which aims to discover how bats use food food food food food food.
They hope to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and tiny bats and brown earlets of bats and circumference bats at the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Western Ross area.
The key sites of the property will set up special recorders to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Professional audio analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of bats' calls and what kinds of things they do.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the region.
Rob Dewar, an NTS consultant for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species is used.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats populations in Scotland and all over the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and developmental work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
Risks also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as flywheels and certain types of chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
In fact, they're not blind.
And because of the night-time hunting practices, the prey is more helpful with the ears than with the eyes.
For the precise determination of errors and obstacles on flight routes, they use a sophisticated echolocation technique.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct research, shelter checks and occasional resolutions.
The organisation established even the first and, for now, the only Scottish reserve dedicated specifically to bats at the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says that property is ideal for them.
“We have an excellent area in Treav for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still a great deal to be known about bats, so the work we do here and on other holdings will help us better understand what they need to succeed."
It stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats prior to the maintenance of holdings, as the potential incoherent destruction of a single donor could lead to death of up to 400 females and cubs, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Batteries are protected, and they are prohibited from killing, harassing or disturbing, and it is forbidden to destroy their obstetrics.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the bat fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply do not know how well their populations stick.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and lawyers prepare for German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo has named charges of rape as "false news" and said that people want to "promot themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for the German magazine lawsuit with Der Spiegel's news, which published the charges.
The attacker Portugal and Juventus accused him of being raped by an American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 for the silence of the event.
Addressing 142 million followers in Instagram Live video for several hours after reporting Ronaldo, 33, the reports marked "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news," said a five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
»By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want everything good," the actor added smilingly.
After reporting the Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing for the Der Spiegel magazine for the charges they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions about private life".
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "no property damage in amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was scheduled to take place in the apartment of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
In the documentation filed at the district court of Clark District in Nevada, after meeting at the Mayorg nightclub with Ronaldo, he was supposed to return to the player's room, and he was supposed to rape her there.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the event in question and told her that "99% is a good man", who only disappoints in "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but he described it as mutual.
Mayorga also claims that she addressed the police and recorded photographs of her injuries at the hospital and later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "frightfully afraid of revenge" and was concerned with "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement because, due to the alleged event, she continues to have severe trauma.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was about to cross from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, worth $100 million, he moved to Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would regret it forever if the world's leading car manufacturer's status had been lost by a peach, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told BBC that the exit of Great Britain from the EU without agreement would suspend production at the Burnston factory near Derby.
“We need an agreement”, said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of peaches could lead without agreement to job losses.
Burnaston factory – which produces Toyoti's model Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK exits from the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, production in our factory would stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin Managing Director at Burnaston factory.
Concerns about how the exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade without agreement have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that after Brexito closed its Mini factory in Oxford for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of peaches.
Toyotine's production line operates according to the principle "at the right time", with parts of suppliers from the UK and EU for cars coming every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom exited on 29 March from the EU without an agreement, this could lead to border disruptions, which industry representatives say could cause congestion and shortages of parts.
Toyota, in her company in Derbyshire, could not coordinate for more than one day parts, said representatives of the company, so production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Therese May's plan for future relations with the EU "acceptably dying to avoid such border checks".
"We have to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to grab this opportunity," said Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The data is not only Toyota, but also other producers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue a highly successful range of supply chains."
Toyot was unable to comment on how long production would have been suspended, and in the longer term it noted that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of Unite's union in the factory, said that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience, the lost job never comes back."
The government official said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be moved again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could, due to the ongoing struggle for the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh, "replace for another week", the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian pre-accession, the link between Trump's co-workers and Russia, and the potential obstacle to the judicial authority.
The question of whether Trump will fire the attorney general and threaten Mueller's independence has been powering up the Washington rumours for months.
In the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about the use of wiretaps for recording talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House in the middle of reporting on his intention to step down.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein would rather not have been fired, and then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into Kavanaugh's charges, further delaying the Senate's vote.
Trump's press rep, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could have happened this week, with everything else going on at the Supreme Court, and it could be postponed for another week.
We'll see. I always like to make sure you're informed."
Some rapporteurs would argue that, and Sanders had not called a White House meeting with journalists since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of meetings was not attributable to the "set" of TV rapporteurs, but said: "I couldn't deny to stand up."
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President held several press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding, without an indication of the source: “We have looked at numbers.”
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists can turn directly to the President of the United States with their questions, it is infinitely better than discussing with me.
We are trying to make it as easy as possible, and you have seen that we have often done so in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at which you will be able to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest states.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown this week why when he freely and partially appeared in front of the collected journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to the NHS Scotland regarding peach-related fears
The Minister of Health is an EU staff working at the Scottish NHS, wrote that they would express the country's gratitude and wish to continue their work on a peach basis.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent the letter less than six months before the UK exit from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “By summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit continued, as it approached the adoption of the decision this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a great deal of concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Fellow Members from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
You can feel completely at home in Scotland. We really want you to stay here.«
Christion Abercrombie Urgently operated after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers Liner, Christion Abercrombie, was reported by Mike Authority in the paper "The Tennessean" after his head was damaged by 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told the press that the injury occurred only a few months ago.
"He got to the edge of the playground and sort of collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie on the edge of the playground with oxygen before putting him on the stretcher and taking him off the field for further inspection.
The official from the Tennessee State University told Chris Harris from the WSM channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie recovered from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the details of the type/size of injury are not yet known" and that the Tennesese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently in the University of Bruce, plays for Tennesian State University for the first time since transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered five punches together before going out of the game, which raised his total number of hits in the season to 18 hits.
More tax will be charged to foreign buyers on purchase of real estate in the UK
More tax will be charged to foreign purchasers in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless, according to new factory plans
The move will neutralise Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the column will be charged for those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £ 120 million a year, and it's going to help the homeless.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher rate of colk to buy real estate in the UK and the money collected will be paid to homeless people, and theresa May will be messages today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to increase the taxation of high-income people.
The rise in the collegiate will be charged to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and will encourage additional money from government efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The amount to be charged in addition to the current collegium, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estates, could amount to no less than three per cent.
The Treasury expects the imposition of the measure to bring up to GBP 120 million per year.
According to estimates, the UK's non-states were to buy 13 percent of newly built London's real estate, resulting in price hikes and heavy purchases of first real estate.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become a “strategic place” as the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for the reduction of the hips to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The big construction company accused the rise in prices by robbing a land that was actually not used and asked Ms. Mayevo to drop quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the British "inhabitant shame".
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and the completion of forced migration without errors.
In addition, it would like to give city councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs Mayev said: “The previous year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Ministerial leadership to restoring British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means correcting our informal housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and make their lives.
It cannot be right, however, that for persons who do not live in the UK and for foreign businesses, buying homes is as simple as for British citizens.
For too many people, dreams of their own home are too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland Club"
Chief Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" was to become manager of Scotland Club.
A 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of revitalizing North East Club, which is currently occupying third place in the First League, with three points less than the first class.
He moved to Stadion of Light this summer after St Mirren took again to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
“I wanted to play as an actor for my country.
I received a B cap and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sportsund show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland frequent as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered if you were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Cania.
A former head of the Allo Atletic team, who has already rejected Barnsley's offer and Ipswich Town's offer, says that as a successor such great names did not feel fear.
“According to me with the question “Can I take this club back to the First League?”
According to the structure and capacity of this club is undoubtedly part of the First League," he said.
"The way to that is not easy, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again."
Ross is doing the job of a manager only three years after the assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts training staff.
Alloi then helped to prevent a third league, and St Mirren led off the edge to the title of the champion of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real turning point," he remembered the takeover of Alloe.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I went as a good player, so I had a pretty good time and I also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
There are a number of things that need to be faced every week.
I still cope with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing for myself.
I always wanted to run a club and do it now. In my skin, I feel more comfortable in my entire adult life."

Research results: ideal time for beer is on Saturday at 17.30 p.m.
Summer heat has increased the income of hard-to-reaching British pubs, but pressure has also increased on the chain of restaurants.
A group of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant with the CGA, said: “Resistance of Sun weather and England’s participation in the world Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of June in the past month, when pub income increased by 2.8 percent, only that restaurants were affected more strongly.
In June, traffic in restaurants dropped by 1.8%.
Transport in pubs and bares with drinks has increased more in comparison than traffic in restaurants has decreased.
The sun's weather has also reduced sales in pubs, which offer mainly food, but not as dramatic as those of restaurant managers.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent over one month and the sale of food decreased by three per cent.”
Paul Newman, a group of RSM's leisure analysts and hospitality analysts, said: “These results have continued the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Sales on the catering market remain the largest factor in weather and the impact of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For the owners of places with food, a long hot summer could not have come at a more wrong time and only time will tell if the recovery will have to bring the moderate temperature that we experienced in August."
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2,7 % in July, indicating the slow introduction of brands.

One of the five children has a secret account on the social network that he hides from his parents
The survey showed that one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — have a secret account on the social network hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students showed false Instagram growth
News strengthens fears about publishing sexual related content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that is intended for parents
One of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — creates an account that he hides from his parents on social networks.
A survey of 20,000 students showed rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news strengthened fears about publishing sexual related content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage censored "main" accounts that parents show, but also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into the secret page of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that she was urging visitors to rape her daughter.
The survey conducted by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Headmasters and Headmasters (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of the students have two profiles of 11-18 and half of them acknowledges that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted and create a web site where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Emileh Doyle will be "a voice of athletics" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most excellent Scottish athlete in the field and outdoors and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
“Eildh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic communities. We are convinced that atletics in Scotland would gain a great deal of respect with its inclusion in the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am impressed that I will be able to act as a voice for an athlete, and I hope that I can really contribute and help with sporting in Scotland."
The American, who won the total of the four Olympic medals at 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for BBC, remained without the ability to speak after the transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was struck by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only take time to tell if I could recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am practicing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!«
The breast pump commercial comparing the mother to cows has distributed online opinions
The company producing the chest pump has divided opinions with an ad comparing the mother to the milk cows.
In order to start marketing the “first silent portable chest pump” the company for consumer technique Elvie published a provocative music video ad that would show mothers all the freedom afforded by the device.
Four true mothers dance in the company of cows in a barn filled with hay, in a song that includes the following words: “Yes, I draw, there does not appear any tail,” and “If you have not noticed, these are not my shadows, these are my boobs.”
The collection continues: "Leverage, drain, feed, feed, drain, drain, crushing the breast."
However, the ad that was posted on Facebook’s website has resulted in significant accidents online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many said it was a joke at the expense of the "grazot" dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also become pregnant and scaffold to produce milk, but children are stolen from them in the first days after they're born," she wrote one.

Another commented: “Of course, it is traumatic for both mothers and young ones.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their children?"
Another added: “A sound completely out of touch. ”
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that it appeared to her "for a ridiculously ridiculous".
"I think that's a genius idea.
I would have bought it, too, if I still breastfeeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it as it was meant to be.
This is a genius product," she wrote second.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad that targets moms who drain their milk (often in the workplace or toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they danced with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw their breasts say they feel like cows.
Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and is discreetly fit into breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the child and even outdoor activities while drawing milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in mother, further commented. "Ellvie's cap is such a revolutionary product that he earned a bold and provocative presentation."
By drawing parallels between women who draw milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus attention on drawing milk and all its challenges, while showing an incredible sense of freedom for the new pump..
This is not the first case when the Elvie pump came to the headlines.
During the week of London, the mother of two children took a walk on the model path for designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen greatly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the gross rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to hand over children to sponsor.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid of endangering their own chances in the country by applying for a child.
The risk was increased in June when the federal authorities reported that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the Agency had arrested several ten people who requested sponsoring unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Above almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are punishable foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to seek these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to address children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers at the shelter said.
Many will show up with a video conference call, not in person, to defend themselves against the immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children in custody, the greater the likelihood of becoming anxious or depressed, which, according to workers' statements in shelters and reports generated in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
The advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornil, where signs of the child’s distress due to their size are more likely to remain unnoticed.
They added that moving children to a tent town without being emotionally prepared or given a chance to say goodbye to friends, could complicate the trauma that many of them are facing.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "opupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home even if war has been going on in the country for eight years.
Moualem, who is also serving as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were unlawful, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would "be in line with them".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” said the assembly.
Moualem said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions had to be left home, "almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until the Syrian territory was cleaned up by both terrorist groups and by "any illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, the United Nations has some 2,000 soldiers, who are primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al Asad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war-destroyed state.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were appropriate and accused of "some Western countries" of "widening unreasonable fears" that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"The political issue is being changed, which should be exclusively a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive recovery funds until the Asad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last important opposition of rebels, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a massive attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces in a province of three million people.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "a clear deadline", and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against the jihadists, including the Fronte Nusra fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Miztura, hopes soon to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of governments and opposition to prepare a postwar constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem identified the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee, saying that the Committee's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump Reaches Second Mandate
After this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the reelection in 2020 unless, as likely, many liberal viewers hope, his presidency will end up with an interpretation and scandal.
Which would be without a doubt "the most dramatic finale of the presidency at any time!"
So far, there's no sign of fatigue of viewers.
Since 2014, the outlook of CNN has doubled to 1.05 million over the time of its greatest view, while MSNBC's perspective almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Canal Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers over the period of time, reaching the maximum number of cable clients from 3.5 million viewers with night-time news on MSNBC channel.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it is something we do not understand," said Neal Baer, the leader of the drama "Designed Survivors", about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys Kapitol.
"Only funny parts: and a few hard truths about sniffing in the Hollivud boys Club" offers a different explanation.
Recall the taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he's making me laugh,’ Mrs. Sovell told me.
It's a fun thing in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what appears on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, given whether immigrant families can reunite and health the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the six-hour view of the round table of experts discussing the use of the source “from a deep background” for the book “Strah” Bob Woodward, 15,000 USD worth of nail leather (“the clothing covered with a flat layer” said The Washington Post) and the consequences of shocking descriptions of Trumkov, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria like that again.
“The work of his doing, which impresses the reality show, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars” on the occupation of Trump’s show and the daily plots of the script (a fight with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong Una).

He could not tear himself apart, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate committee and hung the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
“I remember that we were making all these crazy shows at the time and people were saying, “This is the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fliss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Foreign money shall flow to prepare for the most close interim parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that money floods are observed in the 17th Pennsylvania district as two candidates find themselves in the same seat race due to the redeployment of the congressional districts.
This has recently been the newly divided suburban district of Pittsburgh, home of democratic representative Connor Lamba, who won his headquarters in the special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which highly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was re-examined when the High Judge of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were against-constitutionally painted for the benefit of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district has touched on the fight to fund the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congress Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Labe became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat took place for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators give democrats a slight advantage.
In the United States, they were thinking of sanctions against Salvador for the support of China, and then they retreated.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already confessed to Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting in June 2017 with President Pananame Juan Carlos Varello and had a hotel in Panama until his partners were expelled from Trum's organization.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall the US diplomatic leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "recent decisions to end the recognition of Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a ministry representative at the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered about Salvador, which is estimated to receive USD 140 million in aid in 2017, including aid for the fight against drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been seriously affected by this medium-sized country of high unemployment and the number of murders.
In the course of internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development aimed at continuing a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration from the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus completing the reflections on penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing conference participants, which is now planned for mid-October, a sign of importance attributed by the US government to the meeting, added diplomas.
The three U.S. ambassadors, however, returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The following unpleasant news could be the report by Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of the judicial authority, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller was also to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia in an attack on the American elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr Trump will have to answer to that authority and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues exactly the moment he is preparing to address his constituents again.
There are a lot of questions here, and I do not want to claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as well as his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were willing to strike Hitler if the West had rebelled against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, which left us an opportunity to avoid the flight of slaughter that followed.
On such turning points, the flow of history changes and speeds up or inhibits the unforgivable march of democracy.
Americans are dealing with a number of such breakthroughs right now.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man in the hands of Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since this newspaper reported that he had proposed a secret recording of the president last year and was speculating about his inadequacy for this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the report by the newspaper The Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the requested investigation by the FBI, Brett Kavanaugh, is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed as Supreme Judge in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for Congress, which will require the responsibility of Mr Trump?
If we fail on these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and she ordered me 60 years later to light the shad candles on the table with the swastikas.
How could such an inheritance not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimised before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, making it clear that they will win the Austrians after an impressive premium against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month in a convincing position for qualifications from the G Group of the European League.
The damage to the knee was prevented by Graham Dorrans from first showing up before the Remi with 2:2 against Villarreal in the season, but he believes that the Rangers can use this as a space for greater achievements.
"This was a point for us because Villarreal was a strong team," said 31-year-old.
“We have entered the game into the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
Perhaps we could finally win, but in general, the rhyme is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but it will be a tough game, because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am confident with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I now have a good feeling about this place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we can now continue, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
Poor sleep of women because of fear of savings
Despite the fact that respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people have discussed this with their family members.
Half of the surveyors surveyed Nationwide said that they were talking to spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent of them said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to worry about them, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at Nationwide insurance.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for you if you do not discuss this in due time.
Talk to your adviser and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this may be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include financial consultant: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of funding long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs or self-insurance with their own resources if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of transition.
Choose a medical agent by determining a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals take into account your health wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider also the empowerment of a person for his finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who makes financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are not able to do so yourself.

Vests and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami, which hit the Indonesian town of Pal on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims was to increase further.
In the wake of the broken communications associations, the rescuers from Donggal Regent, the areas north of Pallu, closer to the epicentre of the Magnitude earthquake 7.5, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some of the key data on Palais and Donggals in Sulaves:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesia, a region located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulaves, and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The town celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggalla is a province that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of the island of Sulaves.
The administration, the administrative unit under the province, was estimated to have had a population of 299,000.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulave are aquaculture and farming, in particular in the Donggal Central Region.
In the province, there is also an important activity of nickel mining, which is mainly carried out in Moral, on the opposite side of Slavezia.
Pale and Donggalo, after reporting from the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters, have suffered many tsunamis over the last 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis caused more than 200 people to die and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also hit north Donggalo and caused nine people to die.
Indonesia sits on an earthquake-active Pacific fire ring, and earthquakes occur here on a regular basis.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami affecting 14 countries that caused the death of 226,000 people along the coast of India's estimate, more than half of it in Aceh.
2005: The species of strong earthquakes hit the western Sumatro late in March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island by the coast of Sumara.
2006: The Magnitude earthquake 6.8 hit the southern part of Jave, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 Magnitude took place near Padang, the capital city of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 Magnitude struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered tsunamis of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake struck the Pedie Jaya Regentship in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunamis did not go off, but buildings fell, causing more than 100 people to die.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and caused more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Arresting Sarah Palin's oldest son for violence in the family
Tracka Palina, the oldest son of former governor and vice president candidates Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
A 29-year-old from the place of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, hindering the declaration of domestic violence and resisting arrest, police agency Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report a alleged crime, took the phone out of hand.
The Palace was detained at the Mat-Su Predating Institute and was in custody under unsecured guarantees of USD 500, according to the KTUU TV network.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he spoke of "securely non-confidential", when he was asked about the conspiracy, the network reported.
The Palina was accused of three Class A offences, which means they could close it up to one year and punish it with a fine of $250,000.
It was also accused of one Class B offence punishing one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
Pale of the crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
Mother Sarah Palin called the police and reported a alleged attack.
The case is now before the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the declaration of domestic violence and possession of weapons in connection with an event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin, in 2016, veteran groups criticized when her son’s violent behaviour linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
An earthquake with tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake, which struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The Magnitude earthquake, 7.5, launched tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are suspended and the number of deaths is expected to increase further in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to central Sulavesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
The social media is being circulated by videos showing the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami struck the coast, hundreds of people were held on the beach in Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Jasalla Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died, a rare punishment that has not been committed in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is supposed to use a rental truck to carry out an attack on the cycling routes along the West Side motorway on Lower Manhattan, when in October he ran over several pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "imposed" killed eight victims and "indemnity" caused serious physical damage, it is noted in a notice on the death penalty application lodged in the South District of New York.
According to the case-law, any of the charges may be the cause of the death penalty.
Within weeks of the attack, the grand federal jury of Saipov took note of the indictment at 22 points, which involved eight counts of murder in aiding blackmail, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and intention", said prosecutors, who described Saipov as "obvious, cruel and corrupted".
»Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Draka, Ariel Erika, Herna Ferruchi, Hernana Diega Mendoze and Alejandra Damiana Pagnuccoa," reads in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The South District District Court issued the final death penalty ten years ago.
The accused Khalida Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers and finally turned his sentence into a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty in New York City was last handed out in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he said he felt good about what he did.
After the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos on his phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that he had requested the identification of the flags of ISIS in his hospital room.
On the 22th counts, the defendant pleaded guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "excessively disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We consider that a decision to request a death penalty rather than to accept a guilty guilty confession in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all concerned only will prolong the suffering in relation to these events,” said Patron.
The Saipov defence group had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
To negotiate the peach, we should owe NIGELA PARAGEA, a true Torian Member
Today, Nigel Farage promised to "motivate the People's Army" during a protest at the Toryan Conference.
A former leader of Ukip said that politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics when one of their own Members of Theresa May suggested that it should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone said on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if Mr Farage's secretary had been a pregnant man.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs Mayeva in coordinating his deep - divided species was highlighted by the Toriers, who had joined the separate protest against a peach in the city.
The prime minister seeks to keep his plan on track during the raids of the supporters of peaches, opponents of peaches and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels will try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labours to choose between its package and "coos".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Men's Leave (Depart means leaving) convention in Solihul that he wants to "get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as his co-rapporteur and assign him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
This fellow from Wellingborough added: "I will support the peach, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: “In world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
The meeting was also attended by Toria peaches Andrea Yankyns, who said to the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Minister president, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote on it, but it is also unloved with our client and our activists who are active in the streets and lead us to the election.
Please stop Chequers and start listening.”
In a communication addressed to Mrs. Mayeve, she added: “The Primeers keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said at the meeting that policies should be given "a feeling of heat" if they intend to issue a decision taken at the referendum in 2016.
“It is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
"They are trying to release a peach, and today we are gathered to tell them: "We will not allow this."
In his message, the enthusiastic crowd added: “I want you to feel the fever on the edge of the issue of peaches to our political class.”
"We mobilise the people's army of this country, which has assured us victory in a peach, and we will not rest until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remainingers walked through Birmingham, where they then held a two-hour meeting at the city center.
A handful of activists waved after the group was set up this weekend with flags from the Torijca against the peach.
The Laburist node Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because of the security problems with the application of the client after opening the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the border without congestion, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good peach," he added.
Warren will be pushing for the President's position to "excessively examine"
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that “cooperation in the match for the presidency will be carefully examined” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reported that a Masachuset democratic woman spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warrenov, often critical to President Donald Trump, will re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the Trump election campaign in Massachusetts in November 2016.
It is at the heart of speculation in order to deal with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, the event was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of "town Hall" since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to pursue the position of the President.
Warren said it was time for "the sin of the women in Washington to correct our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of the actor LSU Sims in shooting
Police reported in the town of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect on Friday for shooting an LSU Wayda Sims basketball player.
Police station in Baton Rouge reported the arrest of a 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 o'clock Eastern Time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked to help identify the man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early on Friday near the South University campus.
“Wayde Sims was killed in the head and finally died,” reported police chief Murphy J. Paul, a network of 247sports.
Wade interfered to protect a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene of an event that he had a weapon and that he shot Wayda Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the last season with 10 beginnings, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion, and the team has instructed him to give the victory to Sebastian Vetl
On Saturday, the moment Valteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas began well at the start and almost left Hamilton in the dry when he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
He took Bethtle first to boxing and left Hamilton driving on traffic tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes took him into boxing later and left behind after Vettle, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that Ferrari’s non-confidentiality left the inside side open and risk that after two moves to defend in the third corner he would be left behind.
Max Verstappen started off the back of the net and was on his 21st birthday in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
Then, most of the race vehicles without changing tires, as he intended to make a quick finish, beat Kim Raikkonen and occupy the fourth place.
He finally swung into boxing in the 44th round, but he couldn't increase speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkoren took the fourth place.
It's a tough day because the Valteri was driving fantasticly all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me behind.
The team did a really great job to reach the first and second city," said Hamilton.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senators Diana Feinstein on Saturday for her insistence that she had not disclosed the letters of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate investigative committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, corrupt and lying".
"The only beautiful thing that can happen and that happened in the Senate in the last days, which we can see when you can see that people are wicked, corrupt and lying," he said.
"When you look at publications and disclosures, people say, 'No, I didn't do it'."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the document — “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not revealed it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it to me ... No, we didn't," he added to the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was revealed in early September — but Feinstein denies that it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn’t disclose her letter,” the newspaper The Hill Feinstein reported to the Commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked."
However, her denial evidently did not fit the President who said on Saturday night at the meeting: “I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
It may not be true, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, charged by three women with inappropriate sexual behaviour, the President suggested that the Democrats misuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power by all means possible.
You have seen evil, disgustingness, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to run over to power and control," the President said after reporting on the Mediate website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer hit two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars was bought for a loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning a Saturday match in Dundee 5-3.
It is a small settlement in the Municipality of Šentjur in eastern Slovenia.
"Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie" were equal to the home page, and then, "Dwyer" again achieved the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equalized to Dundee before two goals of Lundvald Nielsen assured them of their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the elite league for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee from the background Friday night at 2:1.
This was the fourth season between the team and the Giants won the last three games.
The first goal of the game was in the fourth minute with the Kendall McFaulla assistant Kendall, Beauvillier, who won four minutes later, David Rutherford passed.
In the intensive introductory part, Sullivan once again played the home page at 13:10, while Matt Marquardt gave Cowni an equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of Giants' leadership on break when he hit his second naked evening at the end of the first third.
The home side was reassembled, and Bouchard ran behind with a force goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined together to lead the Nilesen to the end of the second third, and to make a victory with the fifth goal of his team half-time and to ensure victory with the fifth goal of his team at the end of the last third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
With the death of hundreds of people on board, an air traffic controller made it possible to escape from the earthquake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people died in Friday’s earthquake on the island of Sulaveda, followed by tsunamis, and many were missing.
The area continues to shake heavy earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Pal.
Although coworkers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunawan Agung did not leave his post in a highly collapsing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Pal.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could have taken off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought it was coming down.
He died later in the hospital.
An Air Navigation Indonesia representative, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian Media House ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to take him to a larger hospital in another city from the Balikpapan, California.
I'm sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter hit Pal.
“We have the heart of the market when we hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, as the Agency for the Reduction of Accidents in the country said that access to the cities in Donggala, Sigia and Boutonga was limited.
"The number of dead is expected to increase even further, as many bodies were under the ruins and many could not be reached," said agency representative Suto Purwo Nugroho.
Pale, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, devastated waves of up to six metres [6 m] high.
Military and commercial planes bring assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute of the rescue vehicle brings the bodies.
We're running out of clean water.
Minimarkets are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
On Sunday, President of Indonesia Joko Wido arrived in Pal and addressed the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfil all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?” According to CNN.
In the beginning of this year, earthquakes in Lombok affected Indonesia, where more than 550 people died.
The destruction of the microeconomic aircraft: Air Nigeria now says that one person is missing after the crash of the aircraft in the lagoon.
The airline, which managed a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronasium, now says they're missing one man after they initially reported that all 47 passengers and crews were evacuated from the diving aircraft.
Air Niugini reported on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
They told the airline that they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for the missing.
They did not respond immediately to the call for more passenger information such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were eight passengers left at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The Air Force and the American Navy have reported that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the track.
Some witnesses said that the plane had missed the letter.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down very low.
“It’s extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers had managed to get through to the waist, stretching water to the emergency exits on a dive plane.
He said that the stewardesses started panicking and screaming, but he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The American Navy said that sailors had also come to the aid before the plane sank into about 30 metres (100 feet) deep water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in Papua New Guinea during the last two decades, but this is the first accident that took place to Air Niggini.
An analyst set the time of night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississipius alive in 2014.
A US Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulett has testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone recordings to determine the movement of a 29-year-old defendant named Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on the eve of her death, contrary to his earlier claims, reported the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at a time when he said he was with a friend of Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he was "laid because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The footage on the cell phone shows that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis had deleted Chambers' text, calls, and contact details in time after Chambers died.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury was to judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hiphop?
Hiphop trio aims to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that hiphop has distanced from its original political and social engagement.
They want to return to its roots and remake conscious hiphop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurrection with artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black one?
New York Naval is suing a couple because they fired her because of the "rastic" message
The New York nanny is suing the couple for discriminatoryly firing her after receiving the wrong message she sent to her mother who complained she was "one black".
The couple denies growth behaviour and the lawsuit compared to "excessivement".
In 2016, Lynsey Placeco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when a new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived, found that she was black.
“NEEEEEEEEE SOUTH ENTRY,” said Ms. Lesco-Flaxman in a communication to her husband.
But instead of sending him to his husband, Mrs. Maurice sent him twice.
After finding out what was going on, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “disgruntled”, Ms. Maurice fired, saying that her leaving nanny, who was an African-American, was doing a bad job, so she wanted to employ Filipino, reported the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then they sent her home with Uber.
Maurice now asks the court pair for compensation amounting to USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, things like this are not done,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by claiming that the release of Maurice was reasonable because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after she was sad.
"She sent her wife something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco told his husband about Post.
“ Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.«
In comparison to the action with the "exigration", Plasco said that his wife had only a child two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to put yourself above someone like that?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the proceedings before the court are still pending, the Court of Justice has condemned a couple on social networks as a result of his behaviour and the way in which he is thinking quickly.
The publishers of the paddington Bear were afraid that the readers would not connect with the speaking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born soon after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It was hard to get into the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become a great success.”
She said that her father, who at first worked as a cameraman for BBC, would be bitter when refusing his work, before getting inspired to write a book about a little bear toy, added that, after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book “Greek-Slad.”
Regarding the Bear Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man who didn't like to brag," she said.
"But since the Paddington bear was so real to him, it was almost as if you had achieved something your child: You are proud of him even if you are not really doing it yourself.
I believe that in the success of Paddington's bear, he looked in a similar way.
Even though it was his idea and his imagination, the success was always attributed to the bear of Paddington himself.«
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter was transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors for nothing sought to preserve her life.
“There was a regular call to say that she really felt bad that she didn’t expect it to happen,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nada, and she told me that she was going to die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping were slowly grasping and leaving her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, knowing all this was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where family and people surrounded me.
I really had to keep up."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who has already mourned for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, unrecognizable trials that she is undergoing.
“No one knew," she said.
“ I had my head down, and tears ran in my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this powerful feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieved women's beauty posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one for suicide are trying to turn others away from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valyrian bridge you can sign up with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by smile.
They always said that his smile lit every room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made the posters “to let other people know that there are people available to whom you can turn and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Do not sit quietly – you need to talk.«
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Davies's for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened presents, he did not establish an eye contact with them or anything like that."
She said that his death was severe trauma for them, but they had to process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She broke us up.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is hanging at the start of an investigation by the FBI in the air
“I thought that if we were actually able to carry out what he asked for — after the duration and extent of the limited investigation, this might bring us together,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the world would be afraid of falling apart as a result of a stable party stand.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI's investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
By mid-term elections on 6 November, only five weeks are left – if, as expected, Republicans cut off, they will be greatly weakened in trying to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has made multiple phone calls to senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, who was presented by his current wife, Ashley, now serving as Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, Vice President, a breakthrough from the path of office and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased below Kim
The number of fugitives from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, said South Korean MP.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to South Korean Merger's data, said that last year, 1127 people fled, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices required by human smugglers.
Pingjang has not yet publicly commented on this.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to pass as a highly protected demilitarised area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees as illegal migrants and not refugees and is often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South – which are still technically at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, both countries' leaders met in Pyongyang for talks focused on delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on the effort of the Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho has detained US sanctions since then.
“No confidence in the US will be trusted in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be single-handedly disarmamented,” said Mr. Ri, addressing the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelososi named Brett Kavanaugh as "hysteric" and said he was not fit for service at the Supreme Court.
The minority head of the Nancy Pelosi House of Representatives named Bretta Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and said that he was characterally unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said so in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of another woman as “hysterically” if she had so behaved,” Kavanaugh’s Thursday testimony before the investigation board commented on Pelosi’s comment.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
In the introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally screaming and suffocating on his family and high school years.
He has also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Commission, and he has named the charges against himself as "strategic and coordinated mud-smelling", organised by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he should not be appointed as Supreme Judge because it has shown that he was partial to the democrats.
“I believe that this kind of statement and the way Clinton and Democrats went, has been discredited,” she said.
Pelosija's question is whether she will try to file a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the Democrats will get the majority in the House for a moment.
"I will say this: if Congress or the FBI are not telling the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where it is now," Pelosija said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi said that she is concerned as a democrat about the possible Kavanaugh decision against the Law on Accessed Health Care or the Roe-Wade case, as it is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to go a histterical, biased person to court and expected us to say, ‘Is this not wonderful?’ said Pelosijeva.
And the woman needs to be impressed.
This is a fair fall, after months and years of indignation of anger, and it cannot express it without weeping.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs Steine told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “A woman who was also a director who was also crying when she was angry but developed a technique, when she got angry and started crying, said to the person she was talking to, ‘I might feel sad to you because I cry.
I am angry.”
Then she simply continued.
I thought that was great.”
Tears are partly allowed as an exit for anger because people misinterpret them.
One of my strongest memories from early careers when I was working in an office where men prevailed, and I once found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, an event when I was grabbed by an older woman — a cold leader who was always a little afraid of being dragged onto the stairs.
"Never let them see you weep," she said.
"They won't understand that you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to see you get caught."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a boat in a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, Mrs Schroeder found out that there was no reason why he couldn't run for the president alone.
“It was not a well-thinked decision,” she said 30 years later in laughter.
“The match was attended by seven other candidates, and another was the last necessary thing.
At that time, someone named the game “Sneguljica and seven thumbs”.
As the campaign joined the last one, it was lagging behind in raising funds, so it decided not to enter the game unless it raised $2 million.
That was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I will get a discount?” she wondered.
When she was informed that she would not start a formal campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her — were dissatisfied with a system that made it so difficult to raise money and directed on voters instead of delegates, and the anger of sexualism — were so overwhelm herself.
“I think I’m having a nervous breakdown,” Mrs Schroeder recalled media reactions.
“We would think that my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were gonna write on my necklace.
“Did she cry?”
How the US-China War could Benefit Beijing
The initial US-China trade war salvos were deafening, and although the battle has not yet ended, experts say that the long-term gap between the countries could benefit Beijing.
Donald Trump, US President, launched the first warning in the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion), which effectively means taxation of half of all goods coming to the USA from China.
At each time, Beijing was avenged by equivalent reimbursement measures, most likely with tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to measuring its eye on the US and will probably not blink yet.
In order to give Washington back, China should agree to its demands, but the US's public dedication to Chinese President Shi Gjinpinga would be too disgraceful.
However, experts say that if Peking can pull the right moves, US pressures in the trade war could have a positive impact on China in the longer term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic shock in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a professional associate focusing on Asia in a brain trust centre for new American security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, the real foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to return refugees voluntarily, and is asking for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer to fight terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal status.
All the conditions are now fulfilled to return to the country voluntarily to the refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored rebels.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National field in Paris, France, won the Ryder Cup for 2018.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe has again won the crown when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had trouble most of the championship, won the water at a 16-hole in a couple-3 game at his initial blow to the ball, making it necessary to hand over the game to Francescu Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been shining through all circles and has become one of four players who have ever since the start of the championship in the present form in 1979 achieved a score of 5-0-0.
With 5 and 4, the US Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in Ryder's Cup the last time.
Veterans of the eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, with 25.5 points became the most powerful European player at the championship of all time.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in me.
So happy, I'm so happy we won the Cup again.
It is a team and I am really glad that I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The stafeto passes to John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods on Sundays 2 and 1 in the games of individuals.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to defeat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France to play, and now he has a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3.
This is unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 big titles right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked hard all week to find the right way, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf all over the championship.
After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said: “I am so proud of these boys, they fought.”
In the morning, we put a little pressure on Europe for a second.
We failed.
Get down here in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to get back together and I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're moving on.
I really love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Put it down.
They've played us."
