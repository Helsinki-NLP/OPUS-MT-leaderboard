I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I redefine the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I proposed it.
I put three coffee spoons in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I quit.
I grow goods.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom a story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really gonna get married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like the wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'm very fond of learning French.
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
The iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd get it.
I said it might turn.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is anybody in there?
Is anybody surprised?
Is something wrong?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw him right now.
I saw him play cards with them all.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister take the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism is a religion or philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Everybody busy?
Are they all happy?
Everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats apples or bananas?
I took my head off.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I have to take her home.
I need to pack up.
I should go and change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should've asked her first.
I should've asked them first.
I should've asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Did you study outside?
Is it done?
Is it far away from here?
Is Daddy really slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I stuck a slap on him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a slaughtered man.
I slept in the pot.
I slept on a bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this too good?
I kind of like it.
It's been snowing all day.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mom?
I was staring at a man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped in something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean yes or no?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarcasm?
Is that satisfying?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is he paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this right in English?
Is this Jupiter or bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is this place available?
Was that all about the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I can't believe it yet.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Does Tom die of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Does Tom bother you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did Tom talk to you?
Is Tom there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
A burning match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of the cave.
I say we go home.
I'm trying to get you down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I doubted.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't mess with you or burn and you'd be the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is the freezer still working for you?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm using an opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about which items to pick up.
It all makes sense.
Everything seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
So, no no.
That's not possible!
It's about you.
It lasted a lot more than I expected.
Never, but it could never have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
You let him down.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
It doesn't seem very different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to.
It doesn't matter.
Looks like it's not helping.
It doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I teach him English.
It's my Taman.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have been made somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
He's doing everything.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's no good luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it for days.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's up to.
I think I love you.
I think I made a good point.
I think I'm writing pretty good.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might be sneezing.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should've asked for help.
I think I speak French quite well.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think now is the time to leave.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we have to leave.
I think I've made a mistake.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's brilliant.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box's empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom is hopeless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom is cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a creidac.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's a bit of a tough guy.
I think Tom's vanquished.
I think Tom is resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better not to drink the water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we're gonna join.
I think we're close to the solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you made it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you've been spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I've made a mistake.
I never thought I'd find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought it was coming to me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom went well.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
So didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you're gonna have some work to do.
So you didn't want the reward, did you?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your hand watch.
So don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls lower than you.
So didn't you know how to play the piano?
So didn't you say you could swim?
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
It hurts so bad here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the lid on the toilet up.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day of school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance of doing my job one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not a little cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Are we supposed to use that?
I'm paying.
It's not coming to mind.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get into our head that we can't ignore nature.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
It's on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
Something's wrong with me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
He looked terrible.
You looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks really good.
It looks different.
I think it's familiar.
Looks like an egg.
I guess I drank too much yesterday.
These two seem to be dating again.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
She looks nice.
That's what I got close to Tom.
I've been scratched.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll come tonight.
Maybe it's acting weird.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It's possible it's raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
I told you this would get bad.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I lost it.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are gone.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting.
It was raining two days ago.
He's been resuscitating with a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain it to him, but I don't do it.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to turn.
It's a classic.
You were a disaster!
It is advisable to check if you can have any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the prescription medicine.
It's a children's game.
That's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
Now it's all over.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to leave.
It's so funny.
It's seven o'clock now.
It's 11 o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false trail.
It's a risk plan.
It's too bad concrete's not burning.
Come on, quick enough on foot.
It's just a job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They broke it up.
I'm just having a hard time.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
You better be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and fooling yourself than being a pessimist and being right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Souna's here.
It's a new novel.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's time for closure.
He's studying here.
It's generally known that you're not fond of Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in prison than run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me to be the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to swear.
It's 10 o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's just.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
It's cloudy.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be wild.
It'll get colder.
It's gonna happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
She's in great condition.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's just a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little bit ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
I decide, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring presents like this.
It's nice to feel that he needs you.
It's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret Tom doesn't agree with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do so without great help.
It's not hard to get out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just guessing.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
Don't surprise me.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that somebody buys a $1,000 hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a printed error.
For all of us, it's obvious that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really cool.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's dead.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's quite possible Tom won't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really gross.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's cool!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
He's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's not working yet.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's weird how people in tropical areas eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared.
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It is too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
It's so cool.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
It doesn't hold on to the heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot in here.
I don't know.
There's a wind.
It's work.
You lose.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to come up.
It's been an entire evening.
It lasted a lot more than I thought it would last.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I refused Tom.
It was a great honor to have asked me to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It's been an aren day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an incredible night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a debt to me that I spent the night with a smart, spirited and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a hot night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a beautiful evening.
That kind of behavior was his brat.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was her.
It was them.
Yesterday was fun.
He was having a nightcap.
You were snoring.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a beautiful gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
Bolts living on dogs have been shown to jump higher than cats.
It was so great.
That was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
You've been breathing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to mountain.
It was so obvious.
It was angry.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unmistakable.
It was so generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Beter.
It was worth a try.
It was your mistake.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
Nothing will cost you to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
It works good.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you immediately.
I used to hear you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote down everything that was to be written.
I already wrote my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always kept myself from saying too much.
He's always been helping me.
I always thought you were Boston.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I already asked them all.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little burdened with something else.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
I've had a lot worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been notified.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was stupid.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I gave her some help.
I gave them some help.
They hired me to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I've lived here for years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been busy a lot.

I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.

You can trust her.
You can blame me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you will never capture my mind.
You're allowed to come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
Now you must leave, sir.
You can go and stay, whatever you want.
You can do it.
You'll manage.
You can handle this.
You can take mine.
You know, you can get to know kids' voices with no problems.
You can make your job easier.

Now you can sit down.
You can stay in here.
You can only stay quiet.

You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.

You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny it.
You can't deny it.
You can't do what you think.
You can't fire her.
You can't fire him.
You can't help us now.

You're quickly receiving data.
You cook turkey with bulbs.
It's possible you're wrong.
You could have refused.
You'd be a great mother.
You better ask them first.
Yeah, you found them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a raise.
You deserved better.
You would've done the same in my place.
You've done a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You already did.
You did your best.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You're sick, aren't you?
Do you happen to have a key?
You don't have anyone yet to know how long.
You don't have to be insane to work here.
My son-in-law, you know.
You don't know anything.
You dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You don't have to be there for this.
You don't have to go.
You don't need to panic.
You don't have to put on anything in there.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't get into business.
You don't want to do anything that will remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave the list to Tom, didn't you?
You're entitled to one phone call.
You go pick Tom up and come back.
One shot.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair is a mojo.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
A conscience bites you, doesn't it?
You got a habit I don't like.
You have small breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You've got mylied eyes.
You have many different kinds of people here.
I give you respect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You don't have a head start, do you?
You've never seen one, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
First you have to ask them.
You have to buy them a gift.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You've got to stick.
You have to stay as far away from him as you can.
You can't lose your temper.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very nice lips.
You've got a lot of piercing eyes.
You just heard.
You just got back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
Don't you get involved in this.
Kids, stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a quick learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom get away.
You love your life, don't you?
You'll be fine.
You're gonna get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be notified in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll have a copy.
You'll feel better.
You'll get it back.

You're going with me and a dot!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You're gonna have to learn more next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.
You'll never guess.

You're disturbing me.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be a bad thing to slow down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
You must be relieved.
You must have jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
First you have to show yourself.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You have to protect the child.
You can't give up.
You've got to get over the trouble.
You have to study hard.
You need a friend.

You need to get him to listen.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
You need to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You didn't ask why.
He didn't give us a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth at every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You're paying me very well.
You've chosen well.
You probably think I'm a crook.
It went red.
You ran as fast as you could.
Your car's on fire.
Your car's on fire.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions have defiled the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're city.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.

You're acting weird.
You're Brooke.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.

You're not so young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You're not gonna find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're on his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can go now.

You're lying, Tom.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You push too hard when you shake hands.
Why don't you go see a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's a good memory.
Your moon is coming back.
Your mom put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is difficult.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your statement is about right.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith sucks.
Your role here is so important.
Your shelf is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
All your stuff's here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent is unlocked.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.

You said you were texting me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look distracted.
You seem to know the answer already.
You look like you're cold.
Looks like you've got an infection.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?

You should get some sleep.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.

You sound like it made it easy for you.
You sound very safe.
You cut your ankle.
You're beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You're talking too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are so cute together.
He used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston so much.
You're hurt.
You're drunk.
You've been in a car accident, but you'll be fine.

It was a great help to us.
You're right from the start.
You've done white again!
You bought Mary something.
You beat me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
You overdid it!
You've got a rash.
You're worried enough.
You've got me all wrong.
I promise.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You ruined Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been putting this off for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky to survive the attack.
You made a mistake.
It's not like you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
You were great.
You're not sleeping all night, are you?
He was very brave.
You weren't right about the painting.
You'll do as I say.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You worry too much about him.
I don't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
