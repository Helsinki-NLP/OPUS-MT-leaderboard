What's the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.

It was just cream on the cake.
Pick one.
He got what he wanted.
She drinks like a wrinkle.
They need each other.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long consideration, I eventually made things at the end of my life.
You're absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You let me down.
What is this?
Me too.
That was very good.
She's taking care of her old mother.
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Go straight.
Just like beans.
It's empty.
Where did you get that idea?
Maria pooped.
I give up.
I can't sit still.
Happy Easter!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between rows.
I had a quick lunch.
The wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.

Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Give me an example.
What day is tomorrow?
Can you set an example?

Good to see you again.
Why are you acting like this?
He doesn't miss anything.
We live in an atomic age.
Mary makes a living sewing.
Where's Tom gonna sleep?

Tom's getting on my nerves.
I'm learning now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
Don't waste your words for nothing.
Did you do it on purpose?
Don't get caught.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We ran out of the building.
I'm a rookie.
This tea is good.
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
Everything played out at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I pissed him off.
I was pretending not to see it.
I tried to be kind.
I'm naked.
Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse's burned.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Maria was as angry as a lynx.
Turn left.
Don't you ever pee!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You're under oath.
I wish I knew.
I don't think so.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
He's standing right there.
He's known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?

This is a book.
The bedroom's upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you gonna do today?
Taxi's expensive.
Logic is obviously your stronger side.
I'd like to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You're absolutely right.
You changed my life.
He ran away from her.
The bird on the roof is a crow.
How do I call a cab?
You didn't answer the question.
He was bare chest and barefoot.
I can ski.
What makes you think that?
It's snowing today.
My head hurts today.
I think Tom pulled a thicker end.
I'll do my homework tomorrow.
By the way, where do you live?
The door of the office is yellow.

In this phase of world history, there is not one such thing in America as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is none among you who dares to write your honest opinion, and if you wrote it, you would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I have received a regular salary to keep my honest opinion outside the newspaper I am working for. Many of you have also been paid for similar things, and any one of you who would be so crazy to write what he really thinks would be out on the street, looking for some other business. If I had allowed my right opinion to appear only in one newspaper issue that I do, I would get fired from work for less than 24 hours. (...)

A man has many desires that he does not want to be realized, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise.He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him.This is one wish and a desire for eternal life.
