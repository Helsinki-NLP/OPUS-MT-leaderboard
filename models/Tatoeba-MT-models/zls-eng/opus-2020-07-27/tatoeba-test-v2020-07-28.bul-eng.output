Leave it to me.
They lied to you.

Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even imagine they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?

From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?

Please repeat it once more.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to change his stomach because he ate something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
Your green is going.
I bet you know French.
For dinner Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the seashore.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What will be the time tomorrow?
Is there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I love taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French guilt?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat down on a pinner.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She's convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped in front of the old house, and I saw another city.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is right.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm in a hurry.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus has arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mom's got a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom closed his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she treats everyone well.
Ken plays football every day.
Here you go again at any time.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust at least.
Would you mind waiting outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What kept you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train was 500 miles an hour.
She gave me that compact drive.
The director considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat next to the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible it's love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police don't have to take bribes.
I was in the mountains.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers across southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they can look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that nobody said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'm going to ask you to translate this report to French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
Thank you for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom is lower than the average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful shirt.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't know Najita Tom that well.
I'll tell you the truth now.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's lived here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national peculiarities.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He forgot to feed the dog.
I need to study things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be an astrophysicist.
Tom vomited blood.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
Do you want me to cut it down a little?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, you can do it, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you. I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you leave with my younger sister at the same time?
The sword was delayed for unknown time.
His brother's learning a lot.
Ken arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
Thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming from inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That book about kabuki could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What is the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should just tell Tom he's an opposite.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I'm sleeping with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him that he had wronged the address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a meeting with him at noon.
The invitation said there would be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike ran away very quickly yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you should meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth visiting.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
Do you speak French, too?
I started learning French recently, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom's got little hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a nice trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women - homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to take Tom to the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was checked out of the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you are.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's at Tom's now?
His concert was very good.
Another number of tourists have arrived.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
Tom's easy to talk to.
The twins are completely alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the smile.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
I was sick.
I've got a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's celebration.
You're not the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm mad at myself.
It's done by itself by Tom.
You won't believe the things people throw out.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry much luggage when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture right here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They both work.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her for lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be granted advantage over the others.
I turned you.
Take it with you.
Just wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made fun of me in public.
The pear burned down.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Turn it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke French to Tom.
We all thought Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed out.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel good.
Why early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do what you want; but I will hinder it if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning how to swim during vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me get rid of myself that easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered in snow.
One hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean in French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What is the minimum wage in Lithuania?
There's the hospital I was born in.
He who sows winds will reap storms.
According to the latest census, the country's population is slightly over 7 million people.
The temporary measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted of death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I've got nothing.
For once, think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
Chat-times I think about it.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick it up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was so stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my employees in French.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so high, I couldn't breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she's a little bit out of her mind.
Is Spot gone, too?
I promise I'll get it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out!
Tom's wearing a pacifier.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study in the library together?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in effect.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I need to get out for a while.
Your green is going.
Pinch your thumbs.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me that watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working in the open.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
This store deals with kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay till the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Did any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start snowing.
I've never seen one like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never climbed the top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It probably doesn't matter.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumps.
What is the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debates.
Eat a live frog every morning, and the rest of the day, nothing worse will happen to you.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't blink last night.
Russia is losing 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy smiles.
If you're going to France, you're going to have to press French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We learn French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke's getting too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need this.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wanted him to be single yet.
I have three kids.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
My uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week I had pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring him back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter became a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he's writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my check account.
He was here at this time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are loose.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took his coat off.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make that much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to have lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone coming in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take the bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was alone at home.
In the Esperanto, the essentials end at "o." A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Won't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard that French is a difficult language.
I'm not exactly fed.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol's back at his hotel.
You like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
Get off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
There's still no mention of Tom.
Pass it on to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was woken up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm looking for something not that expensive.
Tom's much easier to speak in English than in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
He's staying a little longer.
I like this color.
My grandmother was operating in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think that's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom searched the drawer to see if there was any pens I could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't time great!
I don't mind that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You'd better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
That's what his ignorance is about.
You're absolutely right.
Everybody knows his name.
My French is no good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are those criminals?
Can you take six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We're gonna throw him a farewell party.
What club do you belong in?
Atushi may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Get back to your seat.
He's graduated from Cambridge with a medal.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom learn French at school?
What shoes are they?
We certainly tried hard.
I'll postpone my journey to Scotland while it warms up.
He started to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay by tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a website, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom was protecting his wife.
She has a wonderful handwriting.
The fingers on the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless, and puppy.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've decided on the ease assignment.
Anybody notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much does a taxi get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiast began his esteemed creation.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more specific.
I'm off this week.
She's washing her socks.
I promise I won't do it again.
I just gave you blood.
He knows neither French nor German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you please tell me your name?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Does he watch your game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it was time for them to leave.
She's makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak in French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make my eyes nice.
I don't have any money.
Milly eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Keep Tom under your eyes.
Jane's out shopping.
That's a nice cake.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long skirts are demode now.
He's doing very well with children.
Come in, please.
We really had fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
It finally stopped snowing and the weather warmed up.
She's been doing little hints of what she wants for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I learn French every day.
I've heard every word.
Where did you get your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used correctly are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't hope so much.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you hand me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't just walk around saying bad things to people.
I had a date at 2:30, but I got into a traffic jam, and I couldn't get there in time.
They went to the museum.
Tom's making a lot of efforts to improve his French.
A lot of time was lost in vain.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you stupid.
I'm speaking French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support, when you fail, costs more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was done.
His shirt was stained with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom's not gonna get any help.
You're not gonna be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What did you finish, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
It's a very interesting story for me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
It was cleaner.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom's been told he's got cancer recently.
Tom came home on a bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
There's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Shake my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long do you have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting was gonna be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary playing with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about the people behind their backs.
She's reached her adult age.
Come with me, let's take a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well-prepared, don't worry.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on which the silk beetles live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I have news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
Put me in pain.
I've tried everything I know.
Why do people fear her?

The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me the number of your room?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bend to their diseases.
I wouldn't have thought the tofu was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
Now what time is it?
Then what does it mean?
I still haven't had my vervain.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned how to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too short.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm sick of my veins.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends and finally everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom speaks with a French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the fair.
I thought it best if I didn't say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you see it carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
This is the sweetest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
It's good food in this restaurant.
I don't do that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my shoes.
I don't know where he is.
Unemployment creates it.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar's sweet.
Where are you going?
That's a great poem.
The prices have been down lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for the transmission of control, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to transfer Tom to the other side of the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the cat by the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were lots of frogs in that pond.
I get it. I get it.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read French, right?
Fred's a little late for class.
Don't cry.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend will come to visit tomorrow.
I hope that happens.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You're gonna love it!
I'm afraid I've affected you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's deprived of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary.
Put on those slippers, please.
I heard it was nice.

I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.

Are there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come over Sunday night?
I remember we've met before.
I look at him as my best friend.

I've seen you somewhere before.
You're studying Esperanto.
My new bike costs me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it till later.
They're best friends.
You're the problem.
You're so superficial.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, isn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom looks objective.
The tunnel failed because of the earthquake from the day before.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What have you been doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the damn door!
We made fun of him for that.
John came in a week ago.
He refused the offer.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The barber is a man who shaves his beards and cuts off men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.

We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be resolved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started learning French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom liked to sing, but nobody wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lay on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not mean.
I'm the usual office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I won't be there in time.
He often walks to school.
The socks stink.
When are you getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're hot.
How many episodes of "Wan Pice" have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is it a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're sweet and sweet.
My sister lives next door to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
My intention wasn't that.
I've got to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I'm asking you a lot-- spray it with a little insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied me that I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your luggage.
Soon after, it started raining.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
Permissions are not required.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says good-bye and wishes me a good night.

You've done a good job so far.
I cooked dinner last night.
Tom can't stand up.

She helped him herself.
I got a job for Tom.
Where'd you throw them out?

"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You're sitting in my seat.
I've already tried it this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this toilet.
You're on a winning streak.
I want something to drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for anything but to take care of the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.

Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot, I'm going out.
Isn't that surprising?
He's making friends with everyone he's met.
You have to study harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.

I got here later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was shaking with fear.

I think they know us.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was wearing red flannels.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say "cheese."

What time is it now?
Can I eat that orange?
Mary loves romantic comedy.
What are they drinking?
Let's be friends.
As far as I know, he must have been born in Italy.
"But really?" "Yes, indeed."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I need to meet Tom.
Although Tom's English sometimes looks pretty good, he has no idea how far his options go and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I saw a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you're fighting with Tom.
Will you respond?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is the best friend of the man. Inside the dog is too dark to read.
It's not working.
My mother made me a very sweet sex.
You need to start now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in some kind of community service?
Do you care?
Apparently, Tom was famous before he released that album.
The Romans would have no chance of conquering the world if they had first been required to learn Latin.
I paid 50 bucks.
Don't drink that.
I think it's best we get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you've always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document to French.
Tom was fired.
Clear the table now!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
Bees make honey.
Tom doesn't want to admit he doesn't know how to do it.
I'm the only one who knows them.
They've been getting iron in this town for 350 years.
I'm playing a television game.
He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting postage stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports exceeded exports.
You don't have a fever.
Has anyone ever told you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French okay?
What kind of person would do something like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane waited, put her back in the tree.
We'll do our best.
Let's go upstairs and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes look good on you.
I've studied French for three years.
I think you should go out now.
Please go away.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom seems really happy.
I never heard Tom speak French until yesterday.
She's French.
Soldiers are used to dangers.
I know a little French.
Please write your contact address here.
Bon appétit!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We got here first.
Will you make it?
The police found a body thrown off the coast not far from here.
We all speak French.
The gentleman knows best the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
Make sure you turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about your life.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor is slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to tell your parents that thing.
Let's just say things honestly!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land is Tom's.
I think you should meet Tom.
Do not add any hints.
He's not here yet.
Your soul will be mine!
A lot of my friends can speak French.
He plays well on the guitar.
Did you play Maincraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medication right now?
The tree's burning.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit, I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We used to drive.
Can I get your coat?
My father will cook me a delicious feast tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just shut the phone down.
You ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom's not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept shooting.
Less and less teenagers work today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's face isn't very pretty, but it's readable.
Shoichi's face is pale.
The electrical flow can generate a magnetic field.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
I've got things to do tomorrow.
The tower was broken into the air and dust.
America is very big.
I heard him stop the car.
Send her my regards.
Is your wife a blonde, or is she a brunette?
I'm out. I'm driving my bike.
The men carried the boy to the hospital.
They were talking too fast to figure out what they were saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given an opportunity.
Would you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
I don't care.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's kind of weird.
Can you do it yourself?
In spring, the days get longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my dad singing in the bathroom.
Singapore speaks English.
I eat bread.
That application was rejected.
She was right.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played to win.
What's in the coffee?
The pear's burned.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I will always remember your kindness.
That smell, and I felt it another time.
Everyone's dying.
I don't understand.
Give me a hammer.
He hates shopping.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a bookworm.
I think you're capable of anything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should do this.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants something to eat.
This box is a little harder than it should be.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice as big as Japan.
Either you take them or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the door.
Tom lives three blocks off the coast.
He's a little bit of a celebrity.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as funny as the book.
The job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is a part of everything called the Universe - part limited in time and space. It sees itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This illusion is a very unique prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our loved ones. Our task must be to get rid of this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it covers all living things and nature in all and beauty.
He will definitely come.
I know it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this form in French?
This local paper shall be published once a week.
I don't know who it is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What is this thing?
Never give dog food to your cat.
I'm having trouble with French grammar.
I put it through my face.
I'll make you happy.
You won't believe it.
Do I have to open everything?
It's totally different now.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted in light brown.
Betty killed him.
Have you started learning French yet?
You can't read French, can you?
Your shirt fits very well with this skirt.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my big brother.
She's become famous.
She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you to stupid.
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that pisses me off.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Does Tom live far from here?
Bad weather wouldn't let me leave.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.
My legs are on my feet.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and get yourself a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to understand when Tom's going to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants a divorce.
You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I heard shots.
I had no intention of putting you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate that for?
If there's a wish, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with your breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom was wondering where she spent her childhood, Mary.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom, and Mary took out their guns.
Are the cats dreaming?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel Tom usually stays in.
Tom was sweating.
You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually talk in French.
I'd like a blouse that fits that jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's kind of a star.
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
You're always complaining.
The milk's gone sour.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We need to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your connection to him?
The Devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother said he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was, I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I have a few calls to make.
Whatever's gonna happen, we're gonna make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple went on a journey around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one home, and I was abandoned all day.
My math is my favorite subject.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom's back to get his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom's back home all covered in mud.
Have you actually tried?
Storm stopped the plane from flying.
Tell me you have some good news.
Which browser are you using?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum wage in your country?
I think you should think again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader are you going to get - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I usually run away from every sorcerin.
The bell rings at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith has been charged with a breach of contract.
Ken's running faster than you are.
They talked to each other.
Are you asleep, honey?
She had twins.
Five gallons normal, please.
I haven't been here much.
Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put your robe on.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
There was a terrible accident yesterday.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste any time.
Why did you come so early?
If you're judging by your awesome tan, it looks like you spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It'll probably snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura may have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There used to be an art museum in this area.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
Sooner or later, his luck will be over.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really that hard to speak in French?
When was the last time he was on a train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if the meal isn't ready by seven o'clock, I'll go to the restaurant.
He left me to wait long.
I'll be right there.
They made us work all night.
He likes English very much.
I heard about your party.
They have to change their attitude.
You want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the closet.
What is the minimum wage in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to understand when the train is leaving.
You have to deal with French more seriously.
I want to go there one more time.
It's so stupid of you to say something like that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you like music?
He was born and raised in Tokyo.
I'm pretending to be working.
She waits till the water boils before she makes tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
They're not likely to come in this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months, he would make us all speak French without a hitch.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
It's become a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And not a word to anyone about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon on the train.
Tom left, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you some sushi.
That's it for today.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.
Save a man, eat a cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French awful.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom drinks water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please, give me a envelope.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
He was asking about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His fog stopped him from looking away.
Anne's a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the post office to send a letter.
Look closely at the map of the wall.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'd be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight down the road and when you pass the lighthouse, you're there.
You've done what you want.
Some people would definitely ask, why don't we just get things together and get out of Afghanistan?
Wake up your socks, please.
I don't waste ammunition.
I'd like to get a picture of you.
Please, put him away.
"What kind of brand is your car?" "It's Ford."
I tried to be your friend.
His second cousin was a member of the Jewish board of directors.
Can you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Have you seen Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back!
Say hello to Jimmy for me.
I haven't spoken to Tom in three weeks.
Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you were wrong.
He didn't mind standing up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have an intolerability to travel by sea.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
It's evidence.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard footsteps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a leaf.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name's Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I've got to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
The wide jackets are the last scream of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little good will on both sides, our problems should be resolved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbed the stairs.
The house we used to live in has been brought down.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
Prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the lighthouse, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why aren't you laughing?
Have you ever congratulated Pfersichbämchen on German?
It was an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this research.
Wouldn't that be nice?
I don't know French, but Greek is all.
He made it clear it was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I get so sleepy?
She answered through tears.
When are you leaving?
Hanako grew taller than her mother.
That's completely different.
The elephant is gray.
I'm studying French at home.
Don't make that much noise, please.
Have any of you ever seen Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me that list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is getting married, and we want to get our heads fixed.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Will you eat that cookie?
I worked hard last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This might be a little burdensome.
Looks like we're running out of water.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green one fits Alice.
Our junk comes together three times a week.
They caught the fox in a trap.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late because of the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
The effort is not only necessary, but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's eleven now.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you studying French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You have to use a deodorant.
When I stand up to you world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I have to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not gonna get into this.
You don't seem too surprised.
This is a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us quickly?
Let's get a sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is being practiced to speak French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People are generally against the war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom taught me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What tooth hurts?
We learn French.
What makes you think that?
You're sitting in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
In school, we learn French every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I've got nothing.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to talk more than listening, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My father often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He didn't know anything about it since he left for America.
I'm gonna have to deal with this now.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
They're all hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, I was learning.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Get me something to eat.
If you have not paid due consideration, please send the due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like toilets in here.
I'm on vacation here.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was rescued by a random passerby.
The City Hall is downtown.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm terribly hungry.
That's very kind of you to get out of your way to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of town Mary lives in.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both pronunciations are correct.
I've never seen a blackout before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated in French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one was able to sleep tonight.
The round went on for about five minutes.
He was going around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I have to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs in?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, what's left to talk about.
I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.
Mike's swimming very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me a long way from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are girl's best friends.
When he was young, his parents died, so his uncle raised him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arrangement.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wants to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how this works.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. how much Japanese food he's starting to like.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You have to point to that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom teaches me to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find an account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to get better.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary is Tom's older sister.
I don't know either boy.
The guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was very nice to meet you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the ladder.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruits rot under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some control errors.
Time is on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It may take some time.
I thought you might turn away.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take it with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled.
He's only four minutes away by train.
What's he trying to accomplish, Tom?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we'd better get out of here.
Tom said it probably won't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, let's keep it quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's too blurry today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he had been away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's get some rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were intrigued by Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two girlfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need this anymore.
Put him back where he came from.
Let's get started.
I fucked you.
Tom found out that Mary was stealing from the money in the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Do you have me so stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, then it's probably worth it.
This is Jane's purse.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this today.
She didn't have much money.
You're sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you learn French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What does Ken eat?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we'll be studying in college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of DNA statements, but there's not a single one for the RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to that.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind was blowing on the vines.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the twenty students, only one has read the book.
I've got work Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have the tendency to trust established authority.
I came home on the train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you have done that in?
What was the name of the guy you used to date before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter to French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the head of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, it's awkward.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
In those days, there was neither TV nor radio.
She went to the museum with a cab.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't you ever say that again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees were shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't be dating.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My veins bleed every time I use a floss.
We got there fast, because the movement wasn't loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He came back from France soon.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those glasses are coming to you.
What'd you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until the grasp's over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's looking at a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes don't fit.
Are you scared of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when did Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
I'm feeling a little sick.
I'm so embarrassed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand veghurts in Tataba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed to do this.
Let's cut in here.
I know this is hard.
Are you a exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Are you thinking of going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If humanity does not care for the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt like I was rejected by these people.
I think you'll have a good time tonight.
Don't pick him up yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest drawback.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, right?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new cards.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers are out of water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
Check, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and leave this letter in the meantime.
That hen hasn't had a single egg down lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You've got nice lips.
A lot of people are gonna lose their jobs because of the car industry collapse.
He came to me for help.
We'll start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's almost over.
The moment of glory for Hanshin did not last long, they were quickly moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Won't that cause any trouble?
He was wrong to be called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail the test?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they reached?
We're finally here!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She hit the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the kitchen window's pervase to cool off.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, what a pity!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Is it good to taste?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth's ball into two balls.
It was personal.
Doesn't it interest you?
It's a great pleasure to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start learning French?
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it'll rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where'd you throw them out?
Tom, how's he gonna handle this?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the photo of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera is Tom's, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're pretty important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Move that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not so much fun.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We have to protect our children.
To new meetings.
I'm totally exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistically.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I intend to go to France.
Please stir the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Budstrause and get off to Zezestrasse.
Laughter is useful to your health!
It's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everyone was telling me about.
Add this site to Preferably.
When the sun of culture is low, even the dwarfs throw a big shadow.
When is the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I'm not going to give in to threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Do you have a tickle?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying up late.
Tom's doing fine.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I get your knife?
You're supposed to hand over the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me that before.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we'll go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil, let alone burn a turkey.
What's the name of that river?
Is tonight your night off?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the roads are covered with ice.
We almost didn't have time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want some orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I won't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French as French.
I think we need to come to an agreement.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket register?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I gonna die?
I got a little sneaky while I was dancing, and I got on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'd like Tom to smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking on the rough road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind, you.
She took the test.
I'll study in the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do it?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made some mistakes on the exam.
This book isn't Tom's property.
Where were you?
I've got to get him out of here.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's a grown man now.
Let's not fool around.
I'm getting better.
It's not art, it's a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
Have you ever heard of him?
She washed her shirt quickly.
Is anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Is Tom really trying to win?
My grandfather really likes to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, baby.
Tom had a single wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night, and with Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
It's a letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother every once in a while.
Men get in shape, riding bikes.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you like.
Bring me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Is there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just shake your thumbs.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French lyrics?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She became twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, doctor.
You don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What's your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come downstairs.
Mary's running.
They long for city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came running with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave himself up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw away those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say things like that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire you for your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels in first class.
Don't stay out till too late.
I'm taking my day off tomorrow.
Nor did I say that.
It's better to give than take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this task?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me this another time.
It's been six years since I started studying English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Could you help me translate this?
Tom almost doesn't understand anything from French.
It's the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner is spending a lot of electricity.
Don't tie yourself to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty has to be cancelled.
First the good God made the man, then made the woman, then he had mercy on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Get your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost on lockdown.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi dances.
Today machines can do a lot for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from flatfoot.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Man's stupidity is endless," I say, and because of this self-criminity, I consider myself an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it got stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter in French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what you'd like, Tom?
The whole road's going uphill.
Aren't you embarrassed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth out last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't hide how you feel about that.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key doesn't go into the lock.
What is the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned the lamp back on.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Pick what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't speak in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my father found out that I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
Our teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put her sweater on.
Sometimes my money ends.
Don't worry, Mr. President, with so many bad wreaths, she hardly even IMA teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a cliff.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They're headed straight for their cause.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
Check, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
The balance pays off.
They arrived separately.
Talking French is fun.
Tom's not gonna make it.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being seen by alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking around in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a pencil.
Don't push me.
I think you should put your beard on.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another non-alcoholic?
A lot of people share my view of it.
The shirt's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his big venture at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court that needs to be filled, but a fire that needs to be lit.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Set the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I can.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He played while he was walking.
I saw the girl between the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, so let's not speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated from Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way of saving you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open to Mary.
The milk makes us cheese and butter.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't mean that.
I'm taking a break this week.
If a sick woman folds a thousand paper cranes, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Check these papers.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom set the engine on fire.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Make 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
The bad weather has prevented us from leaving.
I'm learning French now.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm terribly busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're on a winning streak.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The spread of television has significantly deprived us of our time to read.
I'm gonna need forever to explain everything.
Don't find me in the closet.
The new coronavirus is highly contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm here off the record.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom's not gonna make it by 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toast.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife's stupid.
She looked at me very much.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people can do good work, and others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom's on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian too.
Japan has many excellent traits.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I never should have let you do it alone.
Sentenced to death.
I've only waited five minutes.
Can you show me your photoalbum, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borsh" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom got his knees cut off.
I'll go back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Do you have your driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's right outside the door.
My business is coming back.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the police accident.
I don't see it.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about an increase right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't talked to anyone today except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks an average amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You put your socks on backwards.
We just got word from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's this really about?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're threatening.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are very expensive.
The GNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you even see something out there?
They were all at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as bad as the lazy guy.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to go to my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's go to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He sees TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't touch us so much.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
That's why Tom's not gonna know anything.
Don't forget to bring your kitchen supplies like knives and cooking vessels.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised I'd never do it again.
Jane runs to school sometimes.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen the koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out for a walk.
I hope you're right.
Not less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think that's true.
I've lost track of time.
He thought it might be a trick.
Basho is the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and no one loves anyone.
Tom's got his knee peeled.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report this.
You're pretty good with French, aren't you?
He postponed the party.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They caught five butterflies.
Do it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Put the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
I saw his father arguing with him.
Keep your room clean and neat.
I had a rough night.
She didn't like her husband.
I was studying his face for signs of exhaustion.
Music is the common language of mankind.
Give her some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It would be a pleasure to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom's very interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
It's the Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I can't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Watch me do it.
We're going to the movies.
He goes to the movies with her a lot.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was terminated.
I'll be there for you if you go do it.
What's the name of the Boston hotel you were staying at last year?
That's a complicated problem.
It's 10:00 right now.
It's raining like a bucket.
Are you a bachelor, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We won't be here after 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I was buying books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I love sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to understand.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you are.
The latest developments in medicine are remarkable.
You need to control yourself.
I have no interest in doing that.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it off as lost.
I waited three days.
Material riches often go hand in hand with rejection from society.
Did you count the towels?
You should get yourself a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
A lot of scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't do that.
You're a good singer.
The cat eats.
I'm used to my parents not paying attention to me.
Speaking of trips, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He educated his children well.
I was just being nice.
Tom raises tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She seems a shy young man.
It's made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm having a lot of sleep.
Be more specific.
I was fired.
No one will know.
Tom's out drinking every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his belt on.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him to a chair.
I'm young.
It's a big town.
He promised not to tell anyone.
Are you in debt now?
Can you teach me how to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
I have to tell you something first.
A cup of coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have any other choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the name first, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy palely reminded his father of his appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop because of me.
How do you tell them apart?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't touch them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has a drinking problem?
Is there anyone at the station to meet me?
I haven't heard from him in a few months.
I don't play both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
That's a question I kind of understand.
Why aren't you here?
Tom's the guy who gave me this bike.
We will not fire under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom's a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
It's so good to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you weigh that?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
That's not what I said.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have any subordinates who speak French?
I'm not very good at speaking French.
Ask him about the road to the station.
Bill goes fishing in the day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I give up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works at the wine shop.
Tom had nothing to do.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at 6:00 in the morning.
She makes me uncomfortable.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The stafides are dried grapes.
I've been to India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of possibilities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of the terrible scream made him tremble.
Do you have that shirt in black?
It wasn't a celebration.
Well, you ordered yourself a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg talks too much.
I took things off.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no room to worry about.
We've got physical.
Did you have fun last night?
This sweater is worth over $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their names.
This is for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in the shop.
I have an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Spread your shirts before they get fat.
I'll be there.
Don't get up too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
The investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, you'll need them.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
That book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I'm on Highway 58.
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Unplug your shirt, please.
I almost forgot.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I've got nothing.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We went to a race in Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You've been drinking since my class.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's it going?
I wrote some songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone is one convenience.
Do you sell French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to learn French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I could barely handle the lights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
Ala ballanica, a Turkish panic, that old Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school Tom intends to sign up for.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We've got a lot of big lotus leaves.
We are firmly convinced that when I draw up sentences, the author must avoid submitting to the harmful habits that occur in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are in fact absolutely extravagant in light of the purpose.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move up," made your way and sat down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When's it over?
It hurts me every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some very remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the exam.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what could happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilos of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is this close to your home?
Jane filled out one application.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
Fools run where angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been in sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for this to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You shouldn't say things like that when there are kids around.
He's getting cold.
I want to improve my pronunciation in French.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll teach Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
There's been a silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak in English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct a test on the date of the exam.
Maybe he's avoiding the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll take your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, practically every family has a washing machine.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what is the scope of the study, your main interest.
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hi to Tom.
I think Tom might be drunk.
I've had a lot of heads.
Why don't you sleep?
Mark Zukerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's little chance I can't make it to the meeting.
You always said hello with a present.
How should I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read quite well.
Tom's OK, right?
She looked up in the paper for a while.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in a cemetery in Arlington.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll get to the Hakodata tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man should try.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very excited lately. My favorite football team west.
I was easily attached to the sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language carrier.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while it's still light.
Tom's hurt.
His room is a mess.
They spend part of their free time taking care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom's going to go.
Ask Tom.
Let go of the radio.
I'll stay for three more days.
We delayed leaving for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know the boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
Better put a sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming so fast.
Add this site to Preferably.
I have a lot to say about this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what's bothering you.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like that.
The doctor’s efforts were in vain, and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't home last night.
He's threatening us.
You want to buy that skirt.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French as well.
Are you going?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They've updated the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've had my days in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
It's him, or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl's used to playing alone.
I'm playing in a group.
The birds sang.
Tom finishes his job at 5:00.
Although Tom left early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
There'll be a time when she'll regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get to the museum by bus?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be correct.
What else do you want me to read?
There is one golden rule: where gold is, he lays down the rules.
The house is inhabited by ghosts.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that isn't forever has aged forever.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You always disagree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't give a shit.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty good.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's happening.
Do I make myself clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not receive basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated from philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the work of younger employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't get a man to believe in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel so good.
Air conditioning's down.
You're sitting in my seat.
Does something scare you?
They all agree with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I can't help thinking about it.
I paid 200 dollars in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you understand.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is that?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I don't intend to back off for a little bit of this watch, and not at all talk about breaking up with him definitively.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you can do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made some egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
I bathe every morning in the summer.
Put your shirt on.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't get there in time for his speech.
I'd rather have the grapefruits in front of the oranges.
This place is worth visiting at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just take it.
Her sister smoothed her shirt.
I've told you this another time, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like an orange juice.
From the moment I took your book, until I left it, I was always laughing, and one day I thought I'd start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's tight for the round.
I've seen that, too.
The dolphin's kind of a tradeoff.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be dragged in.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
In Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She refreshed the room with beautiful furniture.
Job calculators can be bought at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British children are needed at school, not less than pencils and tires.
This is the hospital Tom was born in.
You shouldn't wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'll borrow money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like all Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold weather, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom ran around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people visited the meeting.
He put his coat on and left the house.
Tataeba's new website will crawl through the domestic hyper database, built by the basics search engine, and go to the taeebux-OS server with the Daddy's CPU, made entirely by taebie.
Her old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it very much.
I never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
I read all of Milton's work during vacation.
What would you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't be in such a hurry to protect me.
Who's the capital of Greece?
Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar on.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden came out.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His destiny is predetermined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, who would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This species is threatened.
I think you better lie down.
I like you very much.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving on packers.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
Sunday's museum closed.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's happening.
Fill it up.
We have a small chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if that's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved significantly against what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems facing young people.
We've finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more in detail?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we need to study things.
So we all agree.
If time allows, I will go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you'll be a great father.
There's no way you can contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Could you show me this bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is Switzerland's capital.
You won't believe me.
Can you come in at nine?
Let's sync our watches.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a free shop?
I'm looking for a present for my friend.
I wish I'd told you, Kel Fida.
This is the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm sick of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It's far from human.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not rush it.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make hasty conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
All right!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy deep asleep.
She called it what it was.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The lungs were caught out of the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
Kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated you, Tom.
Keep moving.
It's a challenge for me, and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was tired.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish that got Tom.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we can make it in time.
Being a troll is an art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man eats bread.
He's swimming the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone medial sends a message in a bottle, it's just a childish fantasy, when Christopher Columbus sends a message in a bottle, the fate of a whole country is on the map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
Kids play dojball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to act human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums did you visit?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room with me without taking off my coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th, and Muriel's having a birthday.
The way he works doesn't show anything he can brag about.
We don't see things the way they are, we see things the way we are.
She slightly pushed the door.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote a few sentences in berberski.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
