Welsh members of the assembly are concerned about the similarity with the Muppets
Some members of the assembly have been ignored because of the proposal to change their title to "the members of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This came because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the entire political spectrum are concerned that these could become the subject of ridicule.
A Labour member of the assembly said his group was concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers van Wells: On Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means feces.
A member of the assembly from the political party Plaid said that the group in general "is not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh conservative party said his group was "opened" on a name change, but noted that there was a small difference between the terms MWP and Mupetovac.
In this context, the excuse of the Welsh letter w is similar to the excuse of the letter in Yorkshire.
The assembly commission, which is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of a change of name, said "The final decision on the description of the titles of members of the assembly will, of course, be made by members."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the assembly authority to change the name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in great support for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the commission gave priority to the name of members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public debate.
Members of the assembly are reportedly offering alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could cause headaches to be given to President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other amendments to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the Commission's plan.
Members of the assembly will have the last chance to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing state name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The national vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbour represents the ownership of its territory and insists on its requests for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not recognise the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is a simple price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells on St. Martin are silent as the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I talked to say that there used to be bars and churches on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People get different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer quartz living quarters where people go on a regular basis."
As for the church, he worries that the money from the sale of property won't last as long as the executives expect, "and sooner or later, he'll be back where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who won't help preserve the remaining neighbourhood sanctuary.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that worshiped nearby has taken possession of the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main trading street in Harlem, who opposed employment or promotion of black people.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made a recovery plan, they ordered an organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the bells of the poor".
An expert who played organ in July called them different: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that these are the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said that the Church of St. Martin didn't find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been brought by church chiefs and other Episcopal bishops.
The bishop's administration – the administrative body of the diocese, composed of church chiefs – wrote to the bishop in July, expressing concern that the diocese would "try to transfer the costs" to the Bishop's administration, although the Bishop's administration was not involved in renting architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
Sharks hurt 13-year-olds during lobster hunts in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack happened seven hours ago by Beacon's Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said about the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about half an hour ago when he heard a boy calling for help and then he and his group drove to him and helped him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement for catching lobster, but then he "growled that he was yelling" and he bit me!
I'm sick of it!
His whole clavicle was torn apart," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'The shark is in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the pediatric hospital of Rady's where his condition was handled as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in his press address that the shark had already been spotted in that area several weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the area of the upper hull.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 kinds of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becoming a competition with the Boots chains, Superothers and Debenhams that departments of cosmetic products in the style of slave houses in which professional assistants work.
As part of a significant breakthrough in the UK's market for beauty worth 2.8 billion pounds, which is on the rise while selling on the markets of fashion and home equipment declines, larger cosmetic suits will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and will be extended to multiple shops next year if they are successful.
Investment in cosmetic products comes because supermarkets find ways to use the shelves that were once used for televisions, microwave ovens and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic aortics by offering more than 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brand range L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its Botique make-up line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something increasingly wanted by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test the sales venues in two Sainsbury's shops, the first one opened in Croydon, in southern London last week, and the second one will open in Sally Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Buying online and moving towards the daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets must make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of the Sainsbury's chain, said that shops will increasingly look like supermarket stores in an effort to retaliate chains with large discounts Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the departments of Argos store in hundreds of its shops, and also introduced the Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sale of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended infamous.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended up arguing over the division of income from drugstores in their shops.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for £ 125 million.
Lloyds has been said to play a part in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skin care products to four shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the chain of Sainsbury's, said, "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all the needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an inevitable destination of the beauty market that sets new standards compared to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "blessed" after Holly Willoughby retreated from an agreement worth £11 million.
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "bright" after TV television director Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his 11 million-pound personal brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and additional equipment Truly.
The company of this couple was compared to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The head of this Morning (37) announced her departure through Instagram.
Holly Wylloughby pissed off Dragons' Dan Peter Jones' star by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "bright" when the golden girl confessed to television, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in the area of Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there is no more time to devote to their brand of home and additional equipment to Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's company and was predicted to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his cottages.
The source said, "Holly put Truly at the very top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would ensure her profit over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has amazed everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products ready for sale at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning, which is among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothes and home equipment, and possible additional launch dates.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappo 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as company director.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent stakes in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the brand M&S and will replace Ante McPartlin as the head of the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Heavy words, “and then we fell in love”
He was kidding about the criticism he could get from the media because of a comment that could be characterised as "unpresidential" and because of a positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said in his funny voice, "reader of the news."
"I didn't give in at all."
He said that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denucleization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "adequate response" by the United States at the initial steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were one step away from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have great relations."
He said his efforts to fix relations with Kim brought positive results -- suspending missile testing, freeing hostages and returning the remains of US soldiers.
And he stood up for his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidently, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs have been told that their help is not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the island's population has been relocated, the state of national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbb.
While Save the Children's organization is putting together a team to travel to Pala, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Pala to see if they should allow international agencies to participate in helping.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there were no tsunami sirens on the island of Pala, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help earthquake victims is on their way to Pala, but it will take him at least three days to get to the site of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesian maintenance infrastructure and not saving money on roads and railways.
However, funds shortages hit Mr. Joko's administration as he expects new elections next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from prolonged sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced because of street fights by Christian and Muslim groups, using machetes, bows, and arrows, and remaining primitive weapons.
See: Football Liverpool Daniel Sturridge threw a deep equal hit against Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to the Premier League by hitting the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from the Chelsea naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He transferred the ball to his left side, and then he kicked into the outer stairway.
The ball flew high above the crime scene turning towards the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, she fell over the Kep Arrizabalg that was jumping into the net.
"It was only until the position, until the ball was received, and players like Shaq always go forward as far as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea ran 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a hit in the 25th minute.
In that attack he added the ball to Mate Kovačić before he ran from the middle of the field into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic quickly touched and put the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, citing Hazard in a criminal space.
Hazard was faster than a defense and ended up near the stavu by putting in a net with his left foot past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group phase of the League of Champions at three o'clock on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays Videoton in the League of Europe at three o'clock Thursday in London.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
A lot of crowded people have been reported in the ruins of buildings that collapsed the earthquake of the volume 7.5 that took place on Friday and picked up waves high and up to 20 feet, the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference said.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was killed
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning in the Merseyside area.
Forty-four-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called in people nearby who saw or heard something coming.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is early, but I call on everyone who was near John Street Street Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded some cameras on car control panels, to contact us since they may have information that is important to the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived at the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to go back inside.
They heard a cop tell one man that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene of a crime in tears.
She kept saying, "This is so terrible."
At 2:00, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van next door.
Most of the cops were inside a police cordon watching a residential building.
All those who have any information are invited to contact directly @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Creimstoppers line at 0800 555 111 indicating the case 247 since 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament became the latest monument in the middle of an argument on "revision of history"
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England, carried out by its Puritan followers in the Taliban.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "mad" and "try revision of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said, "As part of the ongoing debate on removing the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character in front of the Westminster palace would become a target.
Cromwell didn't even order, or conduct an iconocomb during English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his father Thomas from the previous century.
The magnificent display of Cromwell's author, Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a proof of opinion from the 19th century and part of the history of a character many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to protect parliament from external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
Whether this is entirely true is the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid - 17th century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protectors are also worthy of glory and memory."
The killer's pig caused the death of a Chinese farmer.
The pig attacked and killed a market farmer in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, known only to have been named Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered with blood in a pig in a market in the town of Liupanshui in the area of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai area, China.
He reportedly arrived with a relative from the neighboring Yunnan district on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's pig with blood around her mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the pig had severed 550 libris to cause fatal injuries to the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered," said his cousin, who introduced himself to his last name Wu, quoted Guyang Evening News.
The security camera records show Yuan who came to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
Market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people while police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating damage to his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
A pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, giving critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 libs was fond of a Welsh farmer by his tractor until his wife scared and drove away.
After the pigs ate an oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitobe farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of hurricane Rosa bring widespread showers to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, hurricane Rosa has weakened moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods for showers all over northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosin's hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles an hour from five o'clock in the morning at the eastern time on Sunday, and it was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a meme is formed in the Pacific Ocean and is heading east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture along with the coming gap will create widespread showers in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, applications and possible slides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in rainfalls that will be reached by 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in southwest areas, especially in most of Arizona.
The floods are possible as a result of the sudden deterioration of weather conditions and the typical spread of tropical rain.
A field trip to the desert would be extremely reckless with the danger of tropical rains.
A heavy rain in canyons could result in wild rivers, and a thunderstorm would be mixed with strong winds and sand storms.
The upcoming me will bring the fleshy showers on the parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfalls of over half an inch are possible, which could cause applications and slides in August.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
The scattered tropical shower will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue all Wednesdays.
In October, there can be large fluctuations of temperatures across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remains of summer heat will again try to accumulate and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of about 80 degrees from southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a great possibility of temperature above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's exciting testimony Thursday at the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political reluctance continues with broadcasts that interrupt regular broadcasts due to Friday's latest plot: the deal Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a week-long investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that he's 100% certain he's been drinking Kavanaugh and trying to break up at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company's computerized CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty picking up people who follow the transfer from the office.
To better prove it, it's an audience similar to the one that follows the football elimination matches or the Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of other networks with an average number of viewers of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protesters shouting at him after trying to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the justice commission.
He was looking down a few minutes while he was being insulted, with a live feed on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth?
He was told: “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, there was more to say at the commission's hearing.
Cable and television networks had live broadcasts hours later while the judicial commission voted whether to forward Kavanaugh's appointments to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said it would only be done on condition that the FBI investigates charges against the appointed next week, which calls for a minority of the Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Cons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened up an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuse critics of "playing politics" regarding Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In the second interview to her on the headline of the journal, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying the proposal was that Britain and the EU were taking customs from each other "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims' murder: Police arrested Dyteon Smpson, suspected of LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU club.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police administration said.
Officials posted a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB network's channel reported.
After the Simpson investigation, the police said he confessed to killing Wade.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
The coronership of the East Baton Rouge area issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head and neck.
The department said the credits belonged to the police task force for the fugitives of Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and residents of the area that helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of Club LSU Joe Alleva thanked the district agency for implementing the law on "martivity and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-high-and-six-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
On Friday morning, basketball coach at the LSU Will Wade Club said the team was "is desperate" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what we worry about all the time," Wade said.
Vulcan casts ash on Mexico City
The ash that stains the volcano, Popocatepetl, has reached the southern neighbourhoods of the Mexican capital.
A national disaster protection centre warned the Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity increased in the short run even after a registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center was tracking multiple earthquakes and beatings.
The images on social media show a thin layer of ash covering windscreen cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geofisicists have observed an increased activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since the earthquake was hit by central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan Separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protesters, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police squad, when thousands of people joined in counter-demonstration for marking the anniversary of a polarising Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked Separatists, detained by a special police squad, threw them at eggs and powdered paints, making dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, they broke out and clashed with the police who used the pendrels to stop the fight.
The supporters of independence have been running for hours "No forgetting, no forgiveness" and have clashed with the Union's supporters who were shouting "Cheers of Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries in protests, local press reported.
The tensions are still high in the region that was defined as independence a year after the referendum on October 1st that Madrid declared illegal, but which the Catalan separatists celebrate.
The voters chose independence by a huge majority, although the turnout was low because the opponents boycotted the referendum with mahu seclusion.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by violent clashes across polling stations across the region.
The groups who advocate independence campaigned on Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we're in a jam," he said.
Although they took the key, but a narrow victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties that advocate independence had difficulty holding back because some of their most famous leaders in self-imposed exile or detention, expecting a trial for their role in organising a referendum, and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a police support protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides were fueling the conflict.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in custody since the end of last year, announced his bid in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backdrop of democratic values and the repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men's People Arrested After Caring Home · Global Voices
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after several times driving a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballinagard Crescent Street Thursday around 7:30 in British weather.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point the car was fired from the crossbow.
Menge's shot brought a 1:0 victory against the Rangers to Livingston.
The first goal of Dolly Menge has secured a victory for Livingston
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only another loss for Steven Gerrard in the 18 matches of the club from Ibrox.
Doll Dolly Menge was the key, while Gary Holt's club was equal with Hibernyan in second place.
Gerrard's club has not recorded any winnings in the Prime Minister's League this season and will play against the first-class Hearths for which eight points remain next week.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna to the European League match Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of league winnings to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed out on guests who lacked sharpness
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt went bare, and then Alan Lithgrow's attempt went past the goal after he slipped in to get the ball that Craig Halkett had head-to-head.
The locals responded to allowing the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for guests from free hits.
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
There was a free blow against the Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Mango, who took the ball and shot from the middle of the crime scene.
By that time the Rangers dominated the ball, but the defense of the host remained impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the feet of the goalie Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow kicked too wide from another free shot at Livingston.
Crosses kept coming to Livingston's criminal space and were constantly defended, while the two pens they were looking for – one after the faul against the substitute player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the game hand – were not assigned.
"Fenomenal Game" Livingston – Analysis
Journalist BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni arena
Awesome game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were great and continue to exceed expectations on the upward path.
Their game style and players almost haven't changed since their return to the top, but the great credits belong to Holt who has given energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, until Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Warral through the entire match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerard's bat, they didn't reach that level.
The final strokes were missing – only once they broke through the ranks of the host – and this is the kind of wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
A mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky while Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany, whose goal is to repair NATO's relations with allies.
They differed on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkish entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks outside Turkey live.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who oppose Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect division in opinions about a guest whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others resent him for being a highway.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Cycling was killed in a car crash
A bicyclist died in a car crash in London.
There was a crash near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a traffic road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 British weather.
The car driver stopped and intervened the ambulance team, but the man was killed at the scene.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist died in an accident where the driver left the crash site at Childers Street Street, which is about a mile away from Saturday's crash site.
The London police said they were working to identify the victims and inform the family.
The streets are closed, buses are rerouted, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Prison Long Lartin: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in riots in high-security prison for men, the prison office said.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison, in the Worcestershire area, on Sunday around 9:30 in British time and still last.
A special squad of Tornado officials has been invited to calm the riots involving eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Officials received minor facial injuries and were provided with help on site
The spokesman of the prison administration said, "We have compared specially trained prison staff dealing with an incident under way in Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that it will be responsible for the police and could be extended to prison sentences."
In Long Lartin prison, more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, were found.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, a special task force was called in for serious riots in which the staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which may be of use in areas affected by drought)
It's rare when tropical depression hits Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week, while hurricane Rosa's remaining energy passes through desert southwest areas, carrying a flood risk.
The National Meteorological Administration has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce rain Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 kept the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Center for hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogolon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it is likely to be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In areas where there is no fear of floods, Rose's rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of these rainfalls will probably be beneficial because the southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to the US drought control agency, a little more than 40 per cent of Arizona was hit at the very least by extreme drought, the second highest category," saidweather.com.
First, on its way, hurricane Rosa will lead to a slide on the Mexican peninsula of Bay California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of hurricanes with 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific, and that's why it's gonna start to run.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
The showers in the parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a great risk of flooding.
"The total rainfalls from three to six inches are expected from Bai California to northwest Sonora, and perhaps even up to 10 inches," the weather reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico with the force of a tropical storm before she reaches Arizona early Tuesday morning in a form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rose or her lags is the great showers in Baja California, the northwestern Sonori and the American southwest desert," the National Center for hurricanes said.
These showers are expected to cause lush floods that are life-threatening and applied in deserts, as well as slides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
Teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday, about 4:00 a.m. in British weather.
He's been taken to the hospital, and he's in "stable" condition.
Seventeen-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials are urging those who have any footage of events by cell phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "exhausted the patience and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "took the plight and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he had sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said the Americans saw the glow, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most real legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," a group of supporters in West Virginia said.
The president directly touched Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks of the most important choice of our lives.
Although I am not running personally, I am actually running," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates on all sides."
Trump claims that the Democrats are trying to "prove resistance and interfere".
The first key parliamentary vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a senior Republican party official for CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the big earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Pala on Friday, when waves up to six feet (18 feet) hit the coast at dusk, bringing many to death and destroying everything they have been on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunamis was announced yesterday, people were still dealing with their business on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they were injured," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster-saving agency, addressing Jakarta.
"Cunami did not come alone, he carried cars, balvans, houses, he hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over an open sea at 800km per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the town of Pala.
The photos from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and destroyed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb's power dumped at Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city located on the edge of the long, narrow bay has increased the force of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "obligious" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, sales centers and hotels were torn down.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised for failing to report that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records divided on social networks show a man on the top floor who alerts people on the street under panic to the coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The Reuters couldn't confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
Earthquake and tsunamis have caused a power shortage that has cut off communications around Palu by making it difficult for the authorities to save their efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport was reopened for humanitarian flights only and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims rose above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization must have arrived from Donggala to Pala, where the employees were located in tents erected in the office's yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction on the road, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the relief groups began to take the first steps to alleviate disaster, complaints were that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers would not allow them to travel to Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster of the province's level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international assistance, but this status has not yet been declared."
As the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis fall on Pal, friends and family of missing still hope that their loved ones will be saved by miracle and that their shocking story in this natural disaster will be eased.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers freed a woman who was buried under her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders before the Asian games ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roo Roo Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I am carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that for hours after the story of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel spread through the circles of the paraglider desperately sent whatsApp messages to competitors in Palou who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26.750 while filling ATMs in Newport complex on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves reportedly stole $26.750 from Brink's bankomate in Newport on the Levee.
The car driver emptyed the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, the other man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, standing in a statement, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
For some time, West (41) has been known under the nickname Ye and has used the title for its eighth album, which was published in June.
There was a change ahead of his show on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to promote his new album Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Arian Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons", the author said.
In addition to shorting his current professional name, West said earlier that this word has religious importance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It was made from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more reflective of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names of Love and Brother Love.
Former West's associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without cartoons and large letters.
AMLO in Mexico sworn not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to conquer the Mexican people".
The army shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education push young people into criminal gangs.
United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in that field, said investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US authorities issued posts on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the domain of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: they aim to be first in the domain of innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chance that the next great achievement in the field of artificial intelligence occurred in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Supersile of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houndon Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in 1980 on an artificial intelligence system that proved superior to the highest ranking American Othelo player, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research Company and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee gave recognition to earlier American government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when they were planning the next competitions that could identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"We don't take away China's academic leaders, that's what corporations do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed great individuals from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen their efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to doctors from the domain of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, in the United States, the Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence which seeks to include partners from industry and academic community, and the White House announced the formation of the Electoral Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to form a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote on country name change referendum
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Sunday to change the country's name to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of their northern neighbour is the property of its territory and has vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue this could endanger the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign put it under question whether a 50 per cent referendum would come up with a minimum of 50 per cent referendum to make the referendum valid.
The voter's question read: "Are you a NATO Alliance and an EU member with an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entering bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, to be able to live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje, said.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliament members said they would manage the outcome of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The state electoral commission said there were no irregularities reports until 1 hour in the afternoon.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections when a total of 66 per cent of voters went to the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, it is our place in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son, Dusko, voted in a Macedonian referendum on the change of names, which could open their way to NATO's Alliance and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs in front of tents that were crucified by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but proud land.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring over the necessary investments in Macedonia whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the large majority will vote 'for' because there is more than 80 per cent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after entering the ballot.
He said the result of "for" would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday says the referendum will include between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters -- which is below the need for turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 per cent of respondents are planning to vote Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they'd vote "yes."
In order for the referendum to be successful, 50 percent plus one vote is needed.
The failure of the referendum would have been the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense and reaches the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were rid of Brighton's defenses in the 2-0 Manchester City victory against Brighton at the Ethichad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored at 65 minutes.
The Argentinan attacker received a ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defense players before he was in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green uniforms.
He pushed around one defense player, and he was faster than a few more on the edge of the Brighton goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English gunman used his first blow in the criminal space to return the ball to Aguer, who mastered the goalie Brighton Matthew Ryan's right-hand side of the network with his right hand.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet," said coach City Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored naked at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the skyscrapers the initial advantage of the Prime Minister league.
He scored at 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's side of the field.
It was wonderful to add Leroy Sane to his left flank.
Sane touched her several times before he sent Sterling to the goal.
The sky-blue gunman put the ball in the net before he slipped off the field.
The city is fighting the Hoffenheims in the team stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 p.m. on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Aren Stadium in Synsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game without competitive importance against the Rockies
Since the Nationals was eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to take office on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, which have a match advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in competition.
Rockies at least have a direct pass over the 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, even though we can get out in the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and another team will probably be at the highest level compared to everything else this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals still need to announce the starting team for Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would have been the 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will be thrown on Sunday when he usually rests.
The D.C. right-handed guy runs 18-7 this season for an average of 2.53, 300 statues in 220 2/3 inning.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president took a brief look at the situation regarding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of getting Republicans to the elections in half-determined terms.
"All we've done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choice of our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones -- although I did not actually run for a candidate because I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to restore power by using all the possible ways, you see evil, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to get power and control, power and control are what they want, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a "resistance and distraction" mission.
"And you saw it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bright, evil, evil and dishonest."
He cited a democratic senator and a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Dianne Feinstein, a name that prompted the audience to give up loudly.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you put the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I wait – it was a really bad body language – the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
She is intolerant to those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party's branch voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour members who are said to be not welcome, and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague from parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
A notification from the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local Labour member of parliament, meetings Friday nights were mostly that way.
Unfortunately, a ton of many meetings today is not such a promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it ever was.
It has become increasingly obvious that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I believed we shared similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take views that I would otherwise never agree with, whether it was a national security or a single European Union market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – it's followed by a noise of insults on social networks, calls for removal from the party, verdicts of the centre's policy and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with a bunch of sexist or racist insults every day, but they don't retreat.
The most disappointing thing about this political era is that these levels of insult have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different attitudes and every voice of untrustedness or changes to the rules of selection of parties is narrowed down.
I got a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been pushing me to get my head down, I'm less loud, and then I'm gonna be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Prime Minister Thatcher government's negligence that literally caused my primary school classroom to collapse, I have sought to advocate better public services to those who need it most, whether as a local councilor or minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused with my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal Friday, I would like to say that when the country goes down to Brexit that will endanger households, jobs and our public services, I don't understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not the Momentum in Nottingham, but the voters in my constituencies, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that by threatening me by removing me from the party or the political ploy will not prevent me from acting in the way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unpopulated Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr took the deserved victory in this exciting game of the day at Tennet's Prime Minister League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only ones that aren't defeated by ten teams.
In the end, the home team took the win thanks to superior defenses, as well as the higher number of opportunities used, and Coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayru's every honour, they used their opportunities better than we did."
Grant Naderson's attempt at the 14th minute that Frazier Climo turned, gave his advantage to Ayra, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage, and Jason Baggoto caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo grew the leadership of Ayra before, just before halftime, he achieved a solo attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr in the halftime.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which turned Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury to Ruardh Knott, who was carried out on the stretchers, and in addition Ayr increased his advantage by the attempt by Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair MacPherson, then got a yellow card, and Melrose re-used a numerical advantage with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to a foul over Clim without a ball. MacPherson reached touch down from the line behind the incoming Mola Ayra.
Climo turned it, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's blow to criminal space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt at host.
The star of Still's series game is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of Still game, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move to the catering industry after learning that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-seven-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series he writes about and plays along with his long-standing comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Two men announced that the coming ninth season will be the last in the series and that Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of Scottish Sun's journal suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, ocean blue flags are winding.
Marine bases from Lake Titicac to Amazon are glued to the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning the exit to the sea is our obligation."
All over the land of Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast they lost in favor of Chile in a bloody conflict over natural resources in the 19th century – as well as the longing to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the largest in the last few decades while Bolivia expects a verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of the council.
"Bolivia has caught a run, in the spirit of unity and clearness, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the verdict of the international court of justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge in favour of Bolivia and claims that – after decades of bitter negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of the native origin, who is about to face a controversial re-election fight next year, also plays a major role in the verdict to be made on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The United Nations' body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was issued only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have brought him back.
"The problem of the exit to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian authorities," said Zarat.
Morales' war rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean good will, she noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point, but it will be very difficult to hold these negotiations after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltza, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia a "expected opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement on mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – is using the issue of sea exits as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to exit to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not lift nuclear weapons until they trusted Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor the promises made during the Singapore summit between conflicted leaders.
His comments arrived at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be at the border to re-start nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and meet with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that a continuation of sanctions and opposition to the US declaration ending the Korean war will ever cast North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism when it comes to the seriousness of Pjongjang as regards the denial of the nuclear arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the second summit of Kim and Trump.
In Paris fashion magazines presented the latest line of huge hats you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely hide the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of long-lost giant hats on the runways of their spring and summer 2019 magazine, which shaded everything in Paris's fashion week.
Extraordinarily impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the fashion runways.
The most prominent part of Valentine's play was a too prominent hat with a wide feathered area that swallowed the head of the model.
Among other giant accessories are the watermelons with the ornamented stones, the wizard's hat, and even the pineapple, but their purpose is not to keep your head from being cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had painted lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving gear with a breather and a mask, and the other one reminded of a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you are among those who follow the trend of attention, you are lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after "La Bombe", a straw hat with a two-foot perimeter that was seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Rataykowski.
The cool brand that came up with this very impractical hat that flooded the social networks, sent another big creation on the runway – a straw bag for the beach that was almost as big as the model that wore it.
The Zagasitonaranjska duffel bag with bars and white leather lunch was a prominent detail of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous Luke Armitage's stylewriter said to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops on time for next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-named fashion accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of language is essential for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of extraordinary exam results, which is further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), try to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and more education, the chosen career and place in society of the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can come up with and implement its own teaching plan and programme, we see modern languages as still popular and desirable student election object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands his head, that's what's wrong with him.
If you talk to him in his tongue, it makes him sick."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the exam this year, we see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received A's rating at the high school final.
Data collected from 74 school members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received A from the Mandarin language rating in high school, while 72% of those who learn German, 69% of those who learn French and 63% of those who learn Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will no doubt need children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electoral objects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent schools programs, and elsewhere.
The survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the employers cited the difficulty of filling jobs is the lack of those who know foreign languages.
Thus, knowledge of foreign languages is becoming more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more potential jobs needed to know foreign languages, this skill is essential in the globalization world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a real advantage in the future because it is a skill for life.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to youG's survey conducted among more than 4,000 British people in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak another language well enough to hold a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
As a result, investing in foreign language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to ensuring environments for learning that will prepare children and give them the skills needed for success, whatever awaits them in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages are crucial to the future of the country, so this must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be regarded as "the international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'll fatten the faire.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about the six-game plans during the Lakers season.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a series of pre-election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings in the next week including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote to fill the seat in the Supreme Court is awaiting, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the mid-term because Republicans risk losing control of Congress after a vote in November.
When Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you look at it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven o'clock tonight at eastern time, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally under live feed on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearings this week about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in which it was tense for sexual harassment charges, and the expected vote in the Senate was postponed in seven days until the FBI conducted an investigation.
But the overwhelming goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans achieve a better result in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that meetings are being held this week to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as possible as possible as we enter the election campaign season," Reuters spokesman Trump's campaign refused to present himself.
Ordered in Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's event could gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it will be the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, a country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morris, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is not well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president came to try to raise his ratings in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team has shown combativity to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the fours on Saturday afternoon might be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The stroke of the slaughterhouse is a completely fictional concept in sport, but one of those players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who do they think has a swing right now?
"They led six points, and now four, so it can be said that the swing is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way out.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points more, with twelve more in the game.
Americans, according to Spieth, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot that gives them encouragement, among other forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each took three points from possible four.
Spieth was great from the first to the last punch and leads by his example.
The screams of glory grew louder during his round, in order to end up playing a key blow for an unsolved score in the fourth match when he and Thomas were lagging behind two after two.
His final blow with 15 holes was welcomed by a similar cry, one that reflects the faith that the American team has hope for.
"You just have to do your best and take care of your match," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
An unusual but adorable European couple have won all four matches and play without error.
Mollywood was the only couple that didn't play God's punch Saturday afternoon, and they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they've shown so far is the way they exchange energy with a loud audience, they've established them in the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there's no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory as the sun sets over the fields of Le Golf National Club.
It would be best both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergi Garcia, the hero of the game with four balls that morning, when he played in pairs with Alex Noren.
One god shot and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't even source.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours is so fascinating to look closely at for interactions between couples, tips that they give and which they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage over the final day, but this session of four has also shown that the US team has a desire to fight in which some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe runs 10:6 a.m. before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's matches in the game with four balls and four of them have taken precedence from 10:6 above the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were the first to lead with two victories over the indistinguishable Tiger Woods, increasing the result in the Le Golf National's four points.
The Europeans of Thomas Bjorn in battle to return the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine golf club two years ago, dominated the impeccable Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3:1 series.
The United States has given more resistance to the four tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the gap.
The team of Jim Furyk must win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair in Ryder Cup history who won four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they had a great deal to do with the tired Woods and the American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who snuck through two matches on Saturday, flashed at times, but now lost 19 of the 29 matches in the game with four balls and four and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning's four ball game, returned to Henry Stanson's partner at the Four and suffered defeat 2:1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
Yet Europe did not go according to the plan of this pleasant clear day southwest of Paris.
The triple winner of the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas main tournament set the goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won the 2-1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four ball game, to come back later and defeat Potter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in Ryder's history, a team came back after four points behind a single match, although Furyko's side that defends the title is enough to keep the trophy.
However, after they have been elsewhere for two days, it seems they could not carry out a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea Urges "no speech" on unilateral disarmament unless there is confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the extension of sanctions deepens its non-trust in the United States and that in such circumstances, the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu said at the UN General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant measures to show good faith", such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the demonstration of nuclear polygons and promises that it will not multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no appropriate reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no talking about the first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's known complaints of Washington's resistance to "supervised" approach to denuclarisation by which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, the importance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the game as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current president of the United States and North Korea's leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking the formal closure of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pjongyang must first hand over his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also disobeyed calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States does not give up the ‘denucularisation first of all’ and increase the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by force, against even ‘the declaration of the end of the war’," Ri said.
"The thought that sanctions can throw us on our knees is to let the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader spoke of in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If we were to negotiate this problem with South Korea and not with the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such an undisputed position."
However, Rio's speech was drastically different from last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that the shooting of US land rockets by North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "Rocketache" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for the courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much more should be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea has carried out the denuclarisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If it should, let it take two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should be rewarded for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The Security Council sanctions must remain strictly and without letting them be implemented until full, final, confirmed denuclarisation is reached".
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea, which have been applicable since 2006, in an effort to prevent financing nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been well.
In July, he left Pjongjang with words that progress had been made, and North Korea sentenced him after only a few hours for carrying out "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to demonstrate a rocket range as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "responsible measures".
He said Kim told him that "responsible measures" required by the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
The new Harvard University course this year aims to make students more sleep in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning "all night with caffeine".
One academic noted that students of the world’s leading university are often ignorant of basic concerns about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medical sleep at Harvadro's medical school and hospital specialist Brigham and Women's, has created a course that he considers to be the only species in the United States.
The inspiration to launch this course was given after a speech held on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"At the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my adept year?'
She said no one has ever told her how important a dream is – which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
This year’s first course gives students the basics of how good sleeping habits contribute to better academic and sport outcomes, as well as improving their general condition.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of university healthcare, said that the university decided to introduce a course after students were observed during the week suffering from a serious lack of sleep.
The hourly course covers a series of interactive tasks.
In one part is a photo of the room in the dorm and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to hear more about effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of routine before sleep.
In the second part of the participants, it was said that a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change students' behaviour.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what effects on health has the decision to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of pride for the "aware night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students led to the lack of sleep becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that quality, should be a "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess pounds, since the result of lack of sleep is passed on to the starving regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to come up with a course after taking one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate his maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all graduates to pass a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up alarms on time to sleep and wake up and take care of the harmful effects of "blue light" which emit electronic screens and LED lighting and could disrupt the circadia rhythm, thereby causing problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengin's goal defeated Gerrard's crew
The Rangers suffered another depressing defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga shot Steven Gerrard's team at a 1:0 defeat from Livingston.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after February's 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team made Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the inaccessible leader Ladbrokes League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the uninfected ranking of Rangers never came near the equation.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbed on the third and behind the Hibernian only because of the naked difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after Liner Judge Calum Spence had to show some help when he was shot on the side with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overcame Ayr and placed herself in the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt identified himself as the same eleven players that took points to the Hearts last week and would be thrilled with the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston better use his time with the ball.
It was a little short to score just two minutes after Menga first added to empty space he sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfield player missed a big chance and kicked him by the goal.
The deep free blow of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow was only able to kick up by the goalpost.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the final third gave more hope than faith in its game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have gotten a pen at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem defending Lassan Coulibaly's head and paved the shot that was directed by Ovie Ejari.
Although the first goal of Livingston in the 34th minute may not have reflected the real relationship of strength in the course of the game, no one can deny that he was deserved, if for nothing else, then because of the effort made.
The Rangers again couldn't cope with the deep free blow of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Meng as a simple finale.
Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran from his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to urge guests to play exactly as they fit, with long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor held well and defend Jacobs' attack, and then Lithgow from the corner with his head sent the ball by the goal.
The substitute Ranger, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, was looking for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882 on today 136 years ago... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that will eventually become a device known as Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main scientific challenges, Geiger's counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 Bell Coronade, in which they played seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear your ears from the effects of atoms thanks to the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, just a crackpot!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and then kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure includes the extraction of immunological cells from patients and their changes in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common in many types of cancers, and then re-injection.
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the ovaries of the woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise the malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves the removal of immune cells from the patient, their conversion into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein HER2 and re-injection them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute of Malignancy in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps the growth of several types of cancers" including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectals, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to the removal of immune cells from patients and the "teaching" of those who target malignant cells was effective in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a tough speech in support of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his show on the SNL.
Didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was prominent in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a major performance that praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that night during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he insulted the Democrats and spoke again about his support for Trump.
"So many times I've spoken to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
Well, if I didn't care about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started a sketch show featuring Matt Damon and in which Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate judicial commission regarding claims of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West by putting up the video.
West was also complaining to the public that he had a hard time behind the tower for his hat.
"They teased me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They were teasing me!
And then they tell me that I've collapsed," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "he's going to wear Superman's cape because that means you can't order me to.
Try love."
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL team were visibly ashamed, Variety passed on, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio has been completely quieted down."
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has confused many by performing songs and hunting it disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
Westa supported the head of the conservative group TPUS, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not pulling in front of the villains."
But the head of Karen Hunt's show tweeted that West was simply "what he truly is and that it's absolutely beautiful."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he has embraced and wider ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he "will be previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper named Snoop Lyon, and, of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then "a artist previously known as the Prince".

The defendant is expected to appear at a court of violations in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be discussed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of the series "The Game of Thrones", Kit Harrington condemned toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who beats his sword in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO series Game of thrones.
However, the actor (31) collapsed on the stereotype of macho heroes, saying such roles on the screen mean that boys often feel they should be rude to be respected.
In a statement on the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic macho culture problem at #Metoo.
A whale recently married to a partner from the Leslie Rose Games, 31, admitted that he had a "powerful need" to deal with this problem.
"I am personally rather troubled by the question – what have we been wrong about presenting manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading toxic macho culture because of the imagery of men.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is the matter of raising?
What is it that teaches us on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to fit into a certain pattern of man-to-man behavior?
I think it's actually one of the main questions of our time – how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to follow-up or follow-up of the game's throne after its end next summer, saying he "dealed with the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will be in the theatre piece of Sam Shepherd True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the game of the throne.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Kit's character Jon Snow in this fantastic show that won the Emmy Award.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/side: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, say healthcare officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change compared to the previous situation.
Usually in the past HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way is narrowed down almost to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people in China who live with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV through sexual relations is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer considered illegal since 1997 in China, but they say that discrimination against LGBT is a very widespread person.
Studies estimate that due to conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men with sexual relations with men eventually marry women.
Viral transmission is also often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff published data on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiring theories"
US Ambassador Maxine Waters denied that one of her staff published the personal data of three US Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles claims that the claims are placed by experts and the website of the ultradescular wing.
"Ly, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter release.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared on the network Thursday and was published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate commission hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Preservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of post related to the Waters office and publishes information about a member of its staff has been reported by Hill.
"This baseless claim is a completely incorrect and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and incorrect claims – is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This baseless claim is a completely incorrect and absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon prompted a conviction on the Internet, issued by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial exudes anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temperament needed for a member of Congress.
When he accuses someone of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't be bold.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also appeared via Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office warned "responsible institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will see to it that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they answer before the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous for all the members of my staff."
Film review Johnny English again in action – a young spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already changed into tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also be applied to this continuation of the franchise of satirical action comedy about Johnny English – which started in 2003 by achieving "Johnny English" and returned to the screens in 2011 by continuing "Johnny English: Reborn".
Is an ironic auto-saterate about how obviously useless we are to be the new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, the dumb, incompetent Johnny English rubber face got a new chance to blow something up – with his name more than anything saying that it was a general comic creation designed for territories with a cinema audience that English is not native.
It is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite the bizarre pretensions of the highest glamour, carries little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's trumpet and a crumb of that guy who played only one note in the theme tune of the "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
It is also originally based on a passenger and an international man with a veil of secrets Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest's enterprise are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval knight's armor and when the rotor knives flashed about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems to be weak and in a very strange way superfluous, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and the impossible mission are self-convincingly adding comic elements.
The impression is that it's about humor for children, not for adults, and for me the long-lost adventures of Johnny English are not as innovative and elaborated as the Atkinson gegs of German films in the image of Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current topic that Britain is in serious trouble.
Hacker infiltrated a British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the horror of an agent on duty -- unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a full glass of water for the prime minister, a pompous and depressed guy who's already experiencing a complete break because of the fall in political popularity: Emma Thomson has Masterly played this character based on the model on Theresa May, but the script is quite scarce.
Her intelligence advisors are informing us that all active spies are compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the shitty Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some fancy institution, but is off the record about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting georges when English holds a spy academy in the film "school of Rock".
The English quickly return to Whitehall for emergency instructions and reassemble it with the former extremely patient partner Bower, who is playing Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and noisy role, Vicki Pepperdine, has been spent a little.
So Batman and Robin are back at the service of Her Majesty's Secret Service and happy the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelija Bulletov, who was interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British problems with computers: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their odysssey of comic events: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, making chaos with a bang, boarding Volt's luxury yacht and English launched a real anarchy trying to get to know the interior of the Voltina house using headphones for virtual reality.
Obviously, great effort has been made in this final sequence, but no matter how sweet and cheerful, complete film as if it was made for children.
It's quite a mediocre quality.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week and to be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin will consider a radical plan by which the British would work four days a week, but were paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to transfer time to workers they save thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by giving them another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but would continue to receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party's economic programme and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Syndicate Congress as a way for workers to make use of the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "A new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition that fits into the party approach to economic rebalance in favour of workers, as well as in the party industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the election campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition does not support the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party does not consider it".
The chief of the opposition, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labour Party conference last week to expose his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take over power from the hands of "no-good directors" and "profitters" in utility companies.
The plans of the opposition's Chancellor also mean that the current owners of water supply companies may not regain their overall investment because laborers could impose "rejections" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company committees and to create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10% of the value of the company in the private sector to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about a 60-minute show about whether the FBI's investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and is withdrawing the question whether the Bureau's investigation could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, a correspondent for the 60-minute show, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was unwavering, determined, unambiguous."
But Senator Graham's voice seems to have been confounded.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and a severe accusation would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she appoints can't confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Citizens of the World and did he do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Citizens of the World, an annual musical event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of Citizens of the World will gather tens of thousands of people on the great lawn of Central Park who will not only enjoy performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 World Citizens' Festival, which was first held, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group that advocates ending poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "parts", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, phone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the project of the citizen of the world with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another kind of so-called "cliticism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, citizens of the world have claimed that they have recorded more than 19 million "action" of their supporters who have stood up for a number of different objectives.
They say these actions have led world leaders to declare promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements arising from their actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, the partnership of investors and realisers from Great Britain who have promised to "help children grow up to their full potential", promising that Rwanda will assign $35m to the end of malnutrition in that country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition become a historical footnote," said Ambassador Food Power, Tracey Ulman, to live visitors in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Food project, whose interventions would touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the often asked questions on their page, which reads "why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world answers: "It will be a long and difficult road, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
However, like all the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae, are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
United States could "block" Russia in energy exports - interior secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent exports of Russian energy to third markets, including the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, the US interior secretary, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that the Russian engagement in Syria – namely, is there after the call of the legitimate government – is an excuse for researching new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
"The United States has the opportunity to ensure, together with our Navy, that marine corridors remain open or block them if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the event where the organizer was the Union of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group calling itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, saying it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less made up of using and replacing fuel," he said, saying Russia owns only one asset, and its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration's mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia which represents a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Northern Stream 2 pipeline project that would make Berlin become a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream gas pipeline is $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity at 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economical and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers," Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The US's position has triggered a reaction to Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Alliance of Germany (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the presidential candidacy for 2020, said Senator of the state of Massachusetts
Senator of the state, Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that she would "really consider" running for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the City Hall in the state of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes women at the top," she said, transferring source The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city council, saying he "takes this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called for criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet published Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the polls released Thursday showed that most of the electoral bodies voted for Warren do not think that it should be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters who will "probably" vote in the state of Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Centre for Political Research at Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The poll showed that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's bid, with 38 per cent of voters who support potential candidacy and 48 per cent against candidacy.
Other sound names from the Democratic Order discussed in terms of their potential bid in 2020 were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin was talking about Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's support rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence after an incident that took place Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, can be linked to what happens to other families that suffer the consequences of PTSD and the vulnerability our soldiers are returning to," said the public at expensive support to President Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "burning topic" and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, added "they are returning a little bit different, returning to the firm, returning to ask whether there is respect against what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given for this country, and all the other army members."
He was arrested Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence -- assaulting a female person, obstructing the report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the fact of opiates, according to what Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Administration, said.
18 countries, D.C., support the challenge of a new asylum policy
The 18 states and the Columbia District support a review of the new US policy that is denying asylum to victims who are running away from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who dispute this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against the Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against the federal police has not been discovered.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained that the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, face a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled the 2014 Committee for Appeals of Immigrants that enabled immigrants who do not possess documents and flee from domestic violence to file an asylum request.
State Prosecutor District Columbia, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and thus the chamber violates that principle," the friendly report reads.
Lawyers further in the report argue that the police that prevents immigrants from entering will harm the US economy, and that they will likely become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
State prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant cases in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their home countries for persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or for their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement from June 11th speaking about politics.
The purpose of asylum has never been to ease all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate Rescue Efforts in the City of Pala as the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It is very tense," said Risa Kusum's 35-year-old mother, comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation center in the deserted town of Pala.
"Each minute an ambulance brings bodies.
The government lacks clean water."
The inhabitants return to their ruined homes, searching over flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees were suffered.
Some of the injured like Dwi Harris, who have their back and shoulder broken, are located outside Palua Military Hospital, where patients are being provided help outside due to continued strong side earthquakes.
His eyes are filled with tears as he says he felt a strong earthquake that rocked the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed by the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Embassy accuses China of committing "violence by propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily thanking each other for the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to the Chinese Daily Chinese paid allowance in Des Moines Register on Wednesday, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of getting involved in the US Congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US elections marks, as US officials told Reuters agency, a new phase in an escalating campaign run by Washington to put pressure on China.
And while it is common for foreign governments to publish ads aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where each other increases tariffs on imports.
In contrast, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war focused on exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, said in Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and formerly mayor of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in Sunday's newspaper Des Moines Register, "now doubles that violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"Furthering his propaganda, the China government is exploiting a precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, making a paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in a kiosk located down the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any genuine reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about the problematicly beneficial way of China, bearing in mind that Chinese media are under a solid bat of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused an offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify the newspaper.
Republicans deter women from voting ahead of mid-term elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans who defend and stand with the candidate for the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to give their vote.
In these things there is no back," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in an article for a magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) would at last request an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, not in November," Karina Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokesman for the protest group MoveOn, said in the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters cried out "newmen coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, while Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to endure with Kavanaugh's candidate despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be huge," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news.
"People say he's already tall, which is true.
But he could be taller, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and in younger voters between 18 and 29, who do not like the president, do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she presented details of the charges of alleged sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, analysts felt that negative reactions could occur if Republicans persisted in their appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, quoted the NBC News Network as saying earlier this week.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans resolved this issue and how they referred to it," he stressed for the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group, which supports the choice of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with them slowly leaning towards Kavanaugh's side.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations presented by Ford and at least another person who has brought the indictment, Deborah Ramirez, has reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez reportedly claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals while attending parties during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Developer plans to launch a new Internet that will outreach Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup aimed at being a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, whose creator is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive innovation for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of the Inrupt was "World Domination."
"We have to do it right away," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or "pod" (personal online data store).
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique to the personal data store on the network is that it entirely depends on the user who can access what types of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM security platform, a number of employees of development engineers engaged to work on the project and the volunteer programmer's community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in where all their overnight business models will be completely destroyed.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In his announcement from Saturday on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to secure commercial energy and ecosystems that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Open Data Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross celebration assigned to the priest in World War I
Celebration in honor of the only priest of the Church of England that was decorated by Victoria as a fighter in World War I was similar in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack at the cities of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the greatest British military confession.
On Saturday's parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial plot.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the feat his grandfather received the prize for.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through Kanal Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy shooting with battlefields and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the firing line, and along with the "greatest heroism" led ahead before he stormed into the Polish cannon without anyone's help and cut three men from the military squad.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something that I know I could never achieve, but also something that causes obedience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wedding after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feeled honored by his participation in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support many will give."
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead get Pepu Pig
Imagine that, you stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to make it impossible for you to see the main event in the end.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and was displayed live during the night on Channel 5 channel in Great Britain.
At 6 a.m., right when the Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a confrontation, the viewers in Britain were amazed when the transfer was interrupted by Pepa Pigs.
Many were not at all impressed that they stayed up all night until early morning for fighting.
One fan on Twitter described this break-up with a cartoon film as "some kind of sick joke."
"It is a government regulation where it says that at 6 a.m. the content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a programme for children," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, on a transfer issue.
"Pepa Pig," yes.
Bellator Scott Cocker said he would work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I talk about reruns, I think we can probably handle it," Coker said.
"But there's a transfer there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to realize anything until we have Sundays, when they'll already be there Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was an interruption, they circled the transcripts and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't like that, it was about the government's jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
The Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that it gave him motivation to become successful.
A 24-year-old said he only realized in high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, representing Lauren Laverne, said he openly spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
A regular head of the longtime programme, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months due to illness.
Appearing as a apostate in the first show of Laverne, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of less value and feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
A double winner of the bronze Olympic medals has become a very important fighter for the LGBT population and has used his appearance on this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he was in love with a man, an American producer of Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 "expected".
Daley got married last year to Oscar, who was 20 years older than him, and said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so much while you're so young," he first appeared in the Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- said it was difficult to find someone in the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple came true in the role of the parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley's boy in June, and Daley said that his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was only that "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they still had tickets to London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to sit in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life -- swimming in front of a local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his first song selection - the Proud of Heather Small - who responded in it as he prepared for the Olympics and from which he was still passed by the reapers.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench on Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he'll play his 47th game on Ryder Cup, but he'll have to regain his form so this won't be an unsettling milestone.
Mickelson, who plays the stage for record 12th time, Captain Jim Furyk sent on a bench in Saturday's four ball games and games in four.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, a five-time lead winner spent a day winding up and improving range in the game, hoping to correct what bothers him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the height of his career, is not the ideal choice for Le Golf National's demanding field, where the long irregular terrain regularly punishes stray blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their games this week in a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say more.
"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He very much believes in himself.
He's a member of the Celebrity House and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more of them, but that's how it went, and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-times, even though Furyk said that his presence brought certain immaterial value to the team.
"He's fun, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, it was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a crack game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the individual match Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane first appeared at a game in the town of Valderram in 1997, when the captain whose side was the Seven Ballesteros had the advantage of five points against the Americans, but ended the competition with a close distinction of 14-13.
"You keep reminding us that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a big advantage in Brooklin where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," said Bjorn, designed after watching the team 2018 which won the 5-3 score Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right stuff.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win this trophy, and that leaves focus.
All the time I've been talking, I've been focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's across the road on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
I'm thrilled with the performance of my players at the heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added, "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Tomorrow's the next game, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you test the ultimate possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
That's the message you have to pass on to the players - give it to you tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of these big turns of the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When it starts with such an incursion, it creates a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We've formed our lineup according to that and we've prepared the boys so we can try to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a counter-attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Powell and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this setup because I think it can cover all the way," Bjorn said about choosing a single player.
New German warship on hold again
A new frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace the elderly Cold War warships, but will not arrive in at least another year due to systems failures and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, a leading ship in the class of brand-new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the writing of the newspaper Die Zeit quoted by military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Navy ships from the Baden-Württemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to schedule the latest frigates up to two years without going back to the port of origin.
However, continuing delays mean that the most modern warships, which should have allowed Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete at the time they start to use it, find Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 arrived in the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship for use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the ship's ship after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for returning, but the German media cited a number of key "soft and hardware deficiencies" that would make the ship, if deployed on a combat mission, useless.
The software shortages were of special importance because the ships of the class Baden-Wuertemberg will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors -- exactly half of the number of people who managed old class Bremen frigates.
Also, it turns out that the ship is a significant weight which reduces its effect and restricts the capacity of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” is twice the size of ships similar to those used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, is also becoming problematic.
It is said to have reached a stunning 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
Problems related to the latest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Defence Parliamentary Commission, admitted that the Navy in fact "is running out of ships that can be deployed."
The official said this problem has increased over time, because the old ships have been written off, and no replacement ships have been purchased.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on one property in the hills of Scotland aims to discover how bats use landscapes in search of food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will be followed by simple bats and soprano species, and brown long-headed bats and bats of the species Daubenton in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
Employees and volunteers of the NHS will also do mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of the recordings of all records will determine the frequency of bat calls and what kinds they do.
Then a map of habitats will be produced and a report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at NTS, hopes to show what habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help fortify the use of station management, such as the creation of meadows, and what is the best way to maintain forest for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by works on construction and development, which negatively affect bearings and habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, including sticky paper and chemical processing of construction material, and domestic cats attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when they catch prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, inspection of the bearings, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threava estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says the property is ideal territory for them.
"We have a large bat area here in Threave," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the good habitats.
But there is still so much unknown about bats, that what we do here and on other estates will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
He emphasizes the importance of verifying whether bats are on the property, as it is possible that the destruction of a mother’s bed will kill up to 400 females and young women, which is likely to result in the extermination of the entire local population.
The bats are protected by animals and the law prohibits them from killing, harassing, harassing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish Bats Protection Fund, encouraged the public to engage and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species develops."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers press charges against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges as "false news", saying people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who has released the charges.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, after that, he paid her $35,000 to keep this incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his followers, who are 142 million in video recording on Instagram Live, hours after the indictment report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised reports calling them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, it's false news," he said in a camera of a five-fold gold ball winner.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain fame saying about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," he added a player smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters agency.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "non-material damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents delivered to Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo kneeled to his knees after an alleged incident and told her that he was "99% good guy" who failed those "1%."
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and photographed her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "a fear of revenge" and made sure she "will be publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old says she's looking for a cancellation now because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the reported attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juvea for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that what Toyota UK said about BBC is "concern" - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnstone, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in case Bexit remains without an agreement could cause loss of jobs.
The plant from Burnstone, made by Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop to production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnstone.
Other UK producers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover voiced fears about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his Oxford mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The main fears refer to what car manufacturers call risks in the procurement chain in the Brexit case without an agreement.
Toyote production line functions on the "timely right" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK suppliers and the EU for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be an interruption at the border as far as industry can achieve a delay and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for longer than one day at his Derbyshire factory, the company said, so the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers plan, which offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU, is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow me to say, not only enjoy our current success, but also to grab this opportunity," Radio 4 said in today's BBC programme.
"The example not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for 24 years in Burnstone and is president of the Union Union union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when such jobs are closed, they never return.
The government spokeswoman said, "We must present a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, White House said
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the fight against the Supreme Court's candidate, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, the links between Trump's assistant and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, thus jeopardizing Mr. Mueller's independence, has been on the subject of speaking in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein also discussed sounding to record talks with Trump and the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday, he was at the White House, in the middle of rumors that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Justice Commission hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered Friday that the FBI conduct an investigation into Kavanaugh's charges for a week, further delaying the Senate's vote in full composition.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox News Channel Sunday.
She answered the question about a meeting with Rosenstein: “The date for this meeting has not yet been established, it could be this week, and it could be delayed for another week, taking into account all the other things that are happening with regard to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press to always be informed."
Some journalists would deny this claim: Sanders has not made a brief address for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that a small number of short-term talks are not the result of a rejection against the "teatral behaviour" of TV journalists, although she said: "I will agree with the fact that they are exaggerating."
Then she said it would increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without giving evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it as much as possible and you have seen us do it for the past few weeks, and these talks with the President of the United States will replace short talks with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open seats or press conferences when visiting officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting before the crowds of journalists uninsidiously and occasionally strangely.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland about fears related to Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already pledged to meet the cost of the EU citizens' status requirements working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continue during the summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that for all of you, this has been a very troubled time.
That's why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of its nationality.
Colleges from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting from patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to an emergency operation after head trauma
Defence team player State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after hurting his head in Saturday's defeat 31:27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the stretcher and took it to further interrogation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/or injury" yet and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student in a red uniform, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five total shoot-offs on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 break-downs in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged higher property purchase fees in the UK
Customers from foreign countries will be charged higher fees when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds used to help homeless people according to new conservative plans
This move will neutralise Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Greater taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless
Foreign customers will be charged higher fees for purchase of real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This step will be considered an attempt to neutralise the success achieved by Jeremy Corbin, seeking to attract young voters with promises to provide more accessible housing and focus on those who earn more.
Greater taxes will be charged to individuals and non-tax companies in the UK, with additional money strengthening the government's intention to fight sleep in the open.
An additional fee, which, in addition to the existing fee, including higher levels, was introduced two years ago to another property and purchase for rent, could be as much as 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to increase revenue to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not have a residence in the UK, which is why prices are growing, and customers who first buy property are becoming harder to become owners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "the cities of spirits" because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction of taxis to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused construction firms of holding high prices of real estate by buying first on land they did not use, and asked Mrs May to give up the quota for affordable houses as soon as possible to end the British "failing housing policy".
Mr Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of renting and suspending of any caused works.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my post as prime minister to returning the British dream -- that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses as easily as valuable British.
The dream of ownership of the house has become too distant for many people, and inhuman sleep in the open still remains quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "end ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
The 40-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a club from the northeast, which is currently in third place in the First League, with three points less than the lead.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish League last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was in the B-team and that was it," Ross said for the Sportsoon BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be given if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Allo Athletic Club says he didn't feel anxious because he comes after such big names at such a large club, after refusing to offer the Barnsley and Ipswich Town clubs.
"The measure of my success at this point will be in 'will I be able to return this club to the PM league?'
According to the structure and opportunities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the prime minister of the league," he said.
"It's not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I can only be considered successful if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross was only in his third year of management's career, after a period he spent as assistant chief in Dumberton and 15 months as part of the Harts coaching staff.
Then he helped alloa recover from the fall in the third category, and St. Miren dragged from the edge of falling into the lower league to the champion next season.
And Ross says he's feeling more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," the Allo club's acquisitions were recalled.
"I honestly believed management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made a decent living, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much that you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to do management and now I've been doing it, all my adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than I am now."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, at the Scottish Radio from 12.00 to 13.00 per British summer time
Perfect time for a glass is Saturday at 5:30, reveals the research
The summer heat wave increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
In a group of pubs and bars, there was a growth in sales of 2.7% in July, but the traffic in restaurants dropped by 4.8%, as the figures show.
Peter Martin, of CGA's consulting company, who collected the data, said: "Surrently sunny weather and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern as last June, when pubs grew by 2.8%, and restaurants had an even bigger fall.
The decline in traffic in restaurants from 1.8% in June just deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinking have achieved far the best result with higher growth compared to the comparable results from the previous period, than was the decline in traffic in restaurants.
The pubs focused on food also died due to the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars there was an increase in the sale of drinks by 6.6% in a month, with a three percent drop in food sales."
Paul Newman, from the agency for analysis of the entertainment content and catering of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have been witnessing since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social and sports events remain the main factors when it comes to non-household sales.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the decline in sales of 4.8% on an annual level will be particularly painful with the already present price pressures.
A long hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a bit of the needed relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow introduction of new brands.

Every fifth child has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are 11 years old, has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from her parents and teachers, reveals research
A survey involving over 20,000 students from upper secondary school revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
That news has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say there is a "principal" warrant that shows parents
Every fifth child, one of whom is only 11 years old, makes social networking tasks that are hiding from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 students of upper secondary schools revealed a sudden increase in "false Insta" task, which refers to Instagram's photo sharing page.
The news has increased fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "principle" warrant that shows parents, but they also have private orders.
One mother who came across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who calls other calls to the words "serve me."
A survey conducted by the UK Digital Consciousness and Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools revealed that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: It upsets the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a voice of athletics" on the Scottish athletic board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as an executive director at the annual assembly of that governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete, and the chairman of Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her rich experience gained on the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, UK and around the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beatie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including the 200m and 400m races in the 1996 games in Atlanta, and now a regular expert on BBC, remained motionless after a transit ishemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: "I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can show if I'm going to recover and how much.
It was hard work, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and I'm doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A commercial for a traitor in which mothers compare with cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that manufactures traitors has shared opinions on the Internet with an Internet advertising that compares the baby to the cows of the museums.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as the "first silent traitor", the company for consumer technology Elvie published an ad inspired by a fun music video showing freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between haystacks and cows with a song whose text reads, "Yes, I do but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not fair, it's my breasts."
Next, the chorus: "Pull, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk myself."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions from the viewers, while many said that it sheds light on the "dangerous" dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and be born like us to produce milk, but their babies are kidnapped a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Someone else commented: “It is clear that both mother and baby are traumatic.
But yeah, why don't they use it to advertise traitors to mothers who can hold their babies?"
Someone else added, "The words make no sense."
Others stood in the defense of advertising, and one woman admitted that her song was "turnless".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I was still nursing.
Betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little silly, but I figured it out right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a funny commercial aimed at mothers who issue milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an ad that praises or makes milk industry better."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who issue milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely insolent, no wires or pipes and stands in the breastplate, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out when they issue milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pumpa is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By pulling the parallel between the breast and the cow muzarre we wanted to put into focus the milk issue and all the challenges that go along, showing in a fun and understandable way the amazing sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump ever made headlines.
During the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Martha Jakubowska using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration made it difficult to find the guardians for children.
Traditionally, most of the guardians themselves were migrants without documents that were afraid to jeopardize their possibility of staying in the country by stepping forward to accept the child.
The risk rose in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to print fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs officer, told Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of minors without an escort.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had not been convicted previously.
"Near 80% of people who are either guardians or members of the guardian household are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we'll continue our search for these people, said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to get children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules to which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, said workers at the shelter.
Many will make a video call rather than a personal call, in order to ask the immigration judge for the law of their status.
Those who are found not to meet the conditions will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain closed, the more likely the odds are that they will become anxiety or depression, which can lead to an outpouring of anger or escape, the workers of the shelter and reports coming from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks are increased in larger institutions such as the one in the city of Tornillo, where the size makes it much easier to overlook the signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks urgent withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the war in the country lasts for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also functions as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian country, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at a session.
Moualem insisted that in Syria "the war against terrorism is almost over", where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the world of fighting until we destroy all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly in charge of training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this country with a devastating war.
On the matter of refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and blamed "the individual Western countries" to "extend irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help restore Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of the buffer zone in the last major rebel resistance in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supporting Russia in the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action against jihadists and fighters from the Nusra front would be launched, linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistur hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition to draft a postwar constitution for Syria and prepare the way to the elections.
Moualem presented the conditions of the Government of Syria for participation in the work of the committee, saying that the work of that body should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be selected for a second term
According to that logic, Trump would have been re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, for what many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, recall and scandal would have stopped his mandate earlier.
This would undoubtedly represent "the most dramatic end to the presidential term of all time!"
So far, there's no indication of a viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the impact rating has been more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN channel and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in impact, compared to four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC exceeded cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with impact news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer drama producer "chosen survivors" on the ABC channel, about the secretary of the government who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few harsh truths about inserting into a club of Hollywood boys", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
Why?
"He said: "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos also has fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can decide the future of the abortion law in Roe v Wade's procedure, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what the state of global economy will be.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realize that six hours of watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book "Strah," about Paul Manafort's jacket from an aging skin worth $15,000 (the "Stormy Depravity Department", wrote Washington Post, and the implications of picturesque descriptions, uh, anatomia, Mr. Trump, given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Maria again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he makes you feel like a reality show is that something feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of the show "Depositary", commenting on the rotation of the cast and everyday complications of Trump's show (critical of the American football league, thanking Kim Jong-un).
You can't let yourself miss one episode, or you're behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleis this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at about 80 degrees (27 °C), but he closed himself in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Justice Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

A large inflow of money on the side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congress districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent end of the province's border in Pittsburgh's suburbs led to the elections of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who headed the second district after an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is fighting another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were again drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed in favour of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a fight to fund the campaign between the main party fund collectors, the Committee that collects funds for the democratic campaign (DCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in widely seen special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress district in March.
That position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point area.
Political analysts gave a minor advantage to the Democrats.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdrawing
The diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varrell in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out a steering team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from EL Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, in a statement early month.
But fines were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to receive $140m in US aid in 2017, including for the control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have been difficult to hit this Central American country with a high unemployment and murder rate.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was supposed to be a continuation of a similar meeting last year that was a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and in effect interrupted any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or fines from Washington.
On behalf of Mr. Bolton, the White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following could be a report by special investigator Robert Mueller about the possible Trumpo obstruction of the judiciary, about which there is now significant evidence in the public files.
According to reports, Mr Mueller also directed his investigation into revealing possible links between Trump's campaign and Russia's election attacks.
If most of them change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to get back in front of the voters, and perhaps before the jury.
There are many quiet "if" and I do not wish to suggest that Mr Trump's fall, or those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only to face the West and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breakpoints, and the unforgivable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing several such breakpoints.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the deputy chief prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unprecedented position since this paper last year reported that he has proposed a secret recording of the president and raised speculation that he is not fit to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times statement is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed in spite of convincing accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of that, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for the Congress that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't believe we're going down for a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I was ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles for Sabat on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid in Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive remy in Spain against Villarrel early this month, would put them in a good position to qualify from the G European League group.
The knee injury has prevented federal player Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until an unsolved match with the Villareal final score of 2-2, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use that result as a bounceboard for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and went with the point.
Maybe we could have taken them all the way, but all in all, the unsolved result is probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back to the second and we were better.
A big European evening awaits us again on Thursday.
We hope we can take three points, but it'll be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, though with the support of the audience we can certainly push out and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, starting with everything that happened with my injuries and until a change in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we have right now.
The team's in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we're doing good training.
I hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep worrying about saving their pensions.
Despite the fact that respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, few talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people covered by Nacionwide's research said they discussed long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10% of them said they talked about it with their children.
"People want someone from the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation on the subject," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Natationwide Life Insurance Sector.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to get him, because such decisions can be a significant factor in determining prices.
Turn on your financial advisor: your consultant can help you and figure out a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover those costs or self-secure with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Take care of your legal documents: In root prevent legal battles.
Do your duty to make decisions on medical assistance in order to have an authorized person of trust who will monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider and conclude a contract of power for finance.
This implies that you choose a trust person to make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of the payment of your accounts if you remain powerless.
Do not forget the small details: imagine that your aged parent is in a situation where he needs emergency medical attention and being taken to the hospital.
Would you mind answering questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just funding, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with multiple shots from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with multiple shots from an air rifle as he walked home from the evening out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 12:30 a.m. on British summer time, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police called on witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunamis that hit Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead growth is expected to grow.
As the connection was cut off, the aid officers could not obtain any information from the province of Donggala, areas north of Palu, which are closer to the quake epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It is a Donggala district that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is an administratively lower ranking than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are based on the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nikla mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morocco, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Palu and Donggal have been affected by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Chunami also hit West Donggal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatre in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, a 6.8-degree earthquake hit south Java, the most populated Indonesian island, launching a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 earthquake struck the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The quakes of 7.5 degrees hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatre, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck the region of Pidia Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of the 2004 earthquakes and tsunamis.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the building collapse.
2018.: Large earthquakes hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 people lost their lives, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remain temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of violence in the family, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the State Police Agency of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su detention unit and his 500-dollar parole was determined, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where the issue of guilt pleaded "certainly not guilty", the network said.
Palin was faced with three Class A violations, which means he was threatened by a prison sentence for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a B-class offence, which is fined by a prison sentence of one day and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised the 2016 veteran groups after having linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 75-degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been an interruption of connections and electricity supply, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The epicentre of the earthquake was right next to the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, they're circling videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Pala, when the tsunami clapped the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York City are looking for a death sentence for Sayful Saipoov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used the rental truck of the company Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycling track along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, with footmen and cyclists being shot down on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to a request for a death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
According to both of these points, it is possible to give a death sentence, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saip of 22 counts of murder and racketeering, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saip carried him out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibulavivac Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchia, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnac," the sentence was requested.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since the southern district of New York last had a case in which the death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was committed in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in 19 June 1953 on an electric chair.
According to court papers, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has not shown remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saip told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to launch an attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to point out the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty at 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipoov, said they were visibly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence, instead of accepting a life sentence without the ability to release a plea, will only extend the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense previously asked the prosecution not to impose a death penalty.
The conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilize the People's Army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel dissatisfaction" with eurosceptics, since one of Therese May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
conservative agent Peter Bonne said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would "go out" so far that Mr. Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in an attempt to unite her deep-divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who advocated staying in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from Chequers despite the attacks and supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it continue its attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and laborers to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bonne said at the Otici rally means to go to Solhihull that he wants to "false the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
An MP from Wellingborough added, "I'll fight for Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to pass our laws in our country."
Mr. Bonne rejected allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British had changed their minds and that they wanted to remain completely incorrect."
Brexit's supporters, Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out to the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a harsh message to Mrs May, she added, "The prime ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage told the crowd that politicians must make themselves "feel discontent" if they are about to fail a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us -- people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "it won't pass."
In a message to the thrilled audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of the issue of Brexit, to feel discontent.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that brought us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-rule, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour rally downtown.
Several activists waved at the banners of "Torijecs vs Brexit" after forming a group this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canadian plus plan, for the unfettered state at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
A good Brexit is not possible," he added.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his order provides him with victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Walteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Wettle first went into boxing and left Hamilton behind to get into traffic at the start, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action wheel of the wheel that made Ferrari's driver reluctant to leave free inside at the risk of lag behind after a double move in defense of the third bandage.
Max Verstoppen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran most of the race relying on his tires to get to the quick finish and beat Kimmy Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived at boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight circles until Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day since Walters did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team did a really remarkable job to achieve a one-two formal finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinsten on Saturday for insisting that she did not release a letter to the public by Christine Blasey Ford in which a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president was not directly involved in testifying to Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, evil and lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and mean and lying, he said.
When you look at the announcements and the information they leaked to the public, and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release information to the public?
You remember her answer. Did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it go public."
Well, hold on a second.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, mimicking the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September -- however Feinsten denied that the information had leaked from her office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not release her story in public." Feinstein said to the board, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as she asked."
But her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who at the rally Saturday night commented: "Let me tell you, it was really bad body language."
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence of candidates for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president insisted that the Democrats use these as their own goals.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the evil, the evil, they don't care who gets hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediate conveys the words of the president.

Air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid earthquakes.
Air traffic controller in Indonesia declared a hero after he died ensuring a safe take-off with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, launching a tsunami.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
Despite his colleagues' escape by trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in a control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Palace that was rocking hard.
He remained to ensure the safe take-off of Batika Air Flight 6321, which at the time stood on the runway.
When he realized the control tower collapsed, he jumped off it.
He passed away later at the hospital.
The spokesman Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from the Balikpan in Kalimantana to be transferred to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
Our heart is breaking because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state's disaster relief agency states that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow as numerous bodies remain under the ruins, and many cannot reach," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves that reached the height, and up to six metres, they devastated the Palace, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.

Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Red Cross Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the army of the state: I ask all of you to work all day long to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia hit an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, which left more than 550 people dead.
Air Niugini reports that after the plane crash in the lagoon, one face is gone.
The airline whose aircraft crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Minnesota said one person was being led as a missing person, after it earlier announced that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they are unable to trace the passenger.
The airline says that in co-operation with local authorities, hospitals and investigators work to find this man.
The airline did not immediately reply to the requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy have announced that the plane ended up in the lagoon by not reaching the runway.
Some fathers think the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get through to the emergency exit through the water that went down to their waist on the sinking plane.
He said the crew was panicking and shouting, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby at port repairs also helped rescue the boat by blowing up which passengers drove to the coast before the plane went down to about 30 metres (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the accidents of PNG-registered airlines, 111 people have been killed in the past two decades, but none of them have participated in Air Niugini.
An analyst reconstructs the sequence of events in the night in which the woman is burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution ended the case in a retrial against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Ministry analyst Paul Rowlett has witnessed for hours as a witch in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he was using cell phone records to draw up a picture of the motion of defendant Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data got from several phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, carried by The Clarence Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was on his own claims with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
Asking the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett was that Tellis set a time after Chambers' death from his phone erased her messages, calls and contact information.
He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should start on Sunday with the closing statement.
The judge said he expects a jury trial to follow later in the day.
The High Breed: What's a refreshed hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude towards that genre by filling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip-hop distanced himself from his beginnings when he was dealing with political messages and social topics.
They want to go back to their roots and restore the popularity of the conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons are once again getting the popularity in Great Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
The New York nanny sues a couple for firing after a racist text message.
The New York nanny sues a couple for firing on a discriminatory basis after getting a text message by mistake from a mother complaining she's another black person."
The couple deny being racist, judging the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she realized that she was a new child nurse, Giselle Maurice, a black woman after her arrival on the first day of 2016.
No. Another black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she was sent to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was an African-American woman, had done her job badly and was expecting a Filipino instead, was transferring New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a fee for one day's work and picked up her own house.
Maurice is now suing a couple for compensation for discharge, as well as a fee of $350 a day for six months, for how originally she was hired to live with her family, although without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she told Post Friday, adding I know it's discrimination."
A couple on charges of racism returned that cancelling Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they were afraid that after they insulted her they wouldn't be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to tell her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Job's husband, Joel Plasco, told him.
But would you trust your children to be offended, even if they were wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Describing the lawsuit as an extortion," Plasco said his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and was in a very difficult situation."
You're going to chase someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the proceedings are still ongoing, the court has been quick to condemn money on social networks, criticizing them for such behaviour and thinking.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that the readers would not communicate with the talking bear, the new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: It is difficult to put into position someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before being inspired by a little stuffed bear to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like your child reaching something and you're proud of him, even though it's not really your credit.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in some way.
Though he was the fruit of his imagination, he always credited all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye over the phone.
Her daughter was immediately transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
Over regularly called to say it was bad, and that they did not expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to say that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey."
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep the heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and did not flow through her bloodstream anymore.
She died just a few moments before that and it all went out.
I could've just sat there and waited, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be collected."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, boarded a plane along with the other passengers, who never dreamed of the trouble she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I put my head down, and my tears kept running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes set up cards on the Welsh Bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide when he was 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a perspective chef with a contagious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light every room."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that this will leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people would know that there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit there and keep your mouth shut, talk to me."
Mrs. Humpreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was moody, depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom -- when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything else."
She says his death to them was a huge trauma, but they have to get through it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
That's what's tearing us apart.
But we'll move on and fight."

With the FBI investigation open, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- an investigation of limited duration and scope -- it might bring us together somewhat," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the committee is falling apart due to unsettling party positions.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their dissatisfaction was caused by the choice of the moment.
The elections for Congress are held for only five weeks, November 6th, and if Republicans go badly, as expected, their attempts at the highest court in the country will be chosen by their man will be seriously weakened.
On Saturday, George W. Bush telephoned senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes up his report?
It will be voted in the Senate, which currently sits 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr Kavnaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide with his vote and confirm his appointment for the Supreme Court.
The number of defects from North Korea is dropping under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea in South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the Ministry of Unity of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug states that 1127 defects were recorded last year compared to 2011 when that number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are stronger border control between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs that traffickers charge.
Pyongyang didn't make a public call.
The vast majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a firmly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreans.
China considers refugees illegal, not refugees, and often brings them back.
Relations between the North and South -- which are technically still at war -- have been improving in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped negotiations on denucleisation.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, on which a broader consensus has been reached that it will work to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the progress so far.
Without confidence in the US, there is no trust in our national security either, and under such circumstances it is not necessary that we first unilaterally disarm ourselves," RI said in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was not available for service in the Supreme Court.
Minority leader at Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," and said he was unenoughed for service in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if I ever acted so hysterically," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and hugging when he talked about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, assessing allegations against him by a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality," organised by liberals to angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform office in the Supreme Court since it demonstrated his bias on the damage of the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Asking whether he will try to recall Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get most in the House of Representatives, Pelos has insisted.
I'll say the next thing I know, if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not like him just being in the Supreme Court, but in the court he's on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the judge of District Court of District Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrats, she is concerned about possible Kavanaugh verdicts against the Law on Access to Health or in the case of Roe v Wade, since they consider him a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would recast certain Supreme Court decisions.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to stand in court and be expected to say if it is not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A righteous anger, anger that has been gathering for months and years, and it cannot be solved without pay.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: I was very helped by a woman who was somewhere executive director, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that was so understanding that when she got angry and started crying, the person she would talk to said you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Tears are allowed a way to cast out anger in part and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from earlier work, in a office where most men were in, is that, when I once cried for indescribable anger, an older woman -- a cold boss who I always had a little bit of fear -- grabbed my neck and pulled me to the stairwell.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they think you got hit."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the Money Business ship in 1987 and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she found that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running herself as president.
It wasn't a very well-thinked decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already been delayed, it was lagging behind with fundraising, and she denied that she would not enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her, by frustration over a system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and by the anger of chauvinism -- from which she got into her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what he was going to put on my monument?
She cried"?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canonnades of trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and until the end of the battle is yet to be seen, the gap between countries in the long term can be of benefit to Beijing, hard experts.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export products including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest blow occurred this week with new tariffs that hit 200 billion dollars (150 billion) items that virtually tax half of all the goods coming from China in the US.
Beijing has returned the same measure each time, and the latest introduction of a five to ten percent tariff on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has denied that the United States will respond with the same measure, and the second largest global economy seems to be not going to stop soon.
Force Washington to withdraw means to meet the requirements, but public worship to the United States would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, US pressures in the trade war can positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a steeply profitable decline in one of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, an investigator whose focus is Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country with a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation in the field is much more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have destroyed terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all conditions for a voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that focused on their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that since the beginning of the war 2011 more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Six more million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be welcome to help restore the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that have helped the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National National van Paris, France.
So far, the United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown while a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, threw a ball in the water at the 16th hole of a couple of 3, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shaved in all rounds, and became one of four players who had ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1997 in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost with 5-4 of Throbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked European team player.
The best-ranked world player, Dustin Johnson, has lost 2 to 1 of Ian Powerer from England to whom this may have been the last Ryder Cup.
Veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the Cup again.
Here's an important team and I'm glad I could be of help," said emotional Garcia after European victory.
He teaches his countryman John Ram who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in single matches on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 major titles and is only behind Jack Niklaus.
The American team spent the weekend trying to find a way to the hole, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team was disappointed, US Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, there were moments when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our board of Ryder Cups, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're outplayed."
