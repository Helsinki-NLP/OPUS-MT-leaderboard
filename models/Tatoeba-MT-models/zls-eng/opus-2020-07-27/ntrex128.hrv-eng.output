Welsh parliamentary representatives worry that they will "look like Muppets"
Some parliamentary representatives (Essembly Member, AM) amazed the proposal that they could be called representatives of the Welsh Parliament in the future (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP).
This came due to plans for the parliament to be renamed to the Welsh parliament.
Parliamentarians from all political spectrum are concerned that they could become a subject of debauchery.
An MP from the Labour Party said his group is concerned that the name is "Romanised with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in the Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp shit.
A parliamentary representative from the Walles Party (Vel. Plaid Cymru) said the group was "not satisfied" as a whole and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" for a change of name, but that the MWP in the speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is spoken similar to the letter "U" in Yorkshire.
The parliamentary committee currently preparing a law to introduce a change of title said: "Of course, the final decision on how the MPs will be titled on them."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that came up with broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what MPs will be called in the assembly, the Committee was prone to the term "members of the Welsh Parliament" or the MWP, but the MWP option received the greatest support during the public consultation.
Parliamentary MPs propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring headaches to the presidents of Parliament Elin Jones of whom he is expected to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentary MPs will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to call them.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing country name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted on the name of its northern neighbour representing the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of plebiscite on a change of name, said he would not recognise a referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
They silenced St. Martin's bells while the churches in Harlem were fighting for survival
"The older people I talked to said that a bar and church could be found in the past on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today hang out in another way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood in which people are regularly staying."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and "almost or later will be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people who would not help other churches in the neighborhood will live.
"The great majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "they will therefore come a day faster when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that residents who move into those apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation that maintained worship nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's church took over a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson at the head who led and boycotted merchants on a small street on 125th Street, the main street to buy in Harlem, who opposed employment or promotion of black people.
The 1939 fire has severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned its rebuilding, they ordered a series of bells, so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July used the second title: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to play the black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who has been playing at a larger carillon at Riverside church for 18 years.
Mr. Merryweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin over the past few months has been a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom have brought the laic leaders of the church and other episcopal children.
The sacristy, the managing body of the parish made up of laika, wrote in July about the concern that the child's diet would "try to transfer the costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the occupation of architects and contractors of construction works sent by the children.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the children's side.
A shark injured a 13-year-old while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack happened before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the station KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about an hour and a half Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then led the group to the site of the attack to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was excited about the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy, he noticed that his whole clavicle had been torn apart.
"I am getting tired of everyone coming out of the water: "In the water is a shark!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark was spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct investigation and safety of customers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s beauty market plans for the UK
Sainsbury’s becomes competition with chains such as Booths, Superothers and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of departmental houses and hiring specialized sellers.
As part of the large entry into the UK's beauty market worth 2.8 billion GBP, which continues to grow compared to the decline in the domestic clothing and equipment market, the larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and extended to additional stores next year if they show successes.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways that supermarkets try to use a shelf space that was once foreseen for televisions, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Representatives of Sainsbury’s said they would double the size of the offer of cosmetic products on 3000 products, including the first time and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space from areas with certain brands similar to shops such as Booths.
The supermarket also restarts its aortic decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and that is what younger customers are looking for.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will testly use concessions in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first one opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second one that opens in Sally Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network shopping and returning to daily purchases of small quantities of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets must work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said outlets would look more and more like department stores while the supermarket chain seeks to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s hundreds of shops introduced Argos outlets, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, making it hard to sell live supplies and making the acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint venture with Booths in early 2000, but it ended up arguing about the division of income from a pharmacy in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million GBP sold its pharmaceutical job in 281 Celesia, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims Lloyds will play a part in the plan by putting in four stores a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks commercial director of Sainsbury said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our departments with cosmetic products in order to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at the hands of customers and give them advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changes in old purchasing habits."
Peter Jones "bright" after Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million-pound contract
The star of Dragon’s Den Peter Jones left to "boil from anger" after TV leader Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million-pound contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with the Marks & Spencer and ITV chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their branding clothes and fashion accessories, Truly.
Their brand was compared to the stockmark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The head of this Morning (37) show on Instagram announced that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den Peter Jones' star to cook from anger by withdrawing from the joint profitable work to focus on her own new brilliant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was "bright" when the golden girl television during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts were worth up to £ 1.5 million, meaning that there is no longer enough time to devote to their brands of home clothes and fashion supplements, Truly.
That job was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trade mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would have secured it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has amazed everyone involved in this job.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday so close to starting the entire line.
At Marlowe's headquarters, there's a lot of goods ready to sell."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning, one of the stars in Britain most rewarding investment, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in pillow and candle-spray products to clothing and home clothes and possible further delay in the movement of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby children and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby founded Truly with Capp, and Jones (52) joined them as chairman of the management in March.
Couples spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the brand for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as Head of ITV's I’m a celibacy.
A source close to Jones last night said "We do not want to comment on his business activities."
Heavy negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he will receive in the papers due to comments that some might consider "unworthy presidents" and because he has such a positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
"Why has President Trump given so many concessions?"
said Trump, copying the voice of the news manager.
"I haven't given any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denucleisation negotiations are stuck.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice a "responsible response" to US disarmament activities in North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States still did not lift sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic attitude in his speech at the rally.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would get hurt.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – the suspension of test rockets, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It is so easy to act as president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people to enter this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people directly ahead of him.
The tsunami and the Indonesian earthquake devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after an earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboka's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so all this is a bit of a problem," said Mrs. Sumbbb.
Although the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Pal, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokeswoman for the national disaster office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palou to see if international agencies will be allowed to engage in aid efforts.
In view of the constant ground undermining in Indonesia, the country remains sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coastal line.
The lack of sirens to warn about tsunamis in Palu, although the warning was in effect, likely contributed to the loss of life.
And best time travel between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The boat hospital that was anchored in Lombok for the care of earthquake victims is on its way to Pal, but it takes at least three days to reach a new disaster site.
The improvement of the Indonesian decomposed structure was the basis of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Joko is struggling with a lack of funding, and new elections are being held next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and dozens of thousands scattered from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets of machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Player Daniel Sturridge scored a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from defeating the Premier League game against Chelsea by hitting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was approximately 30 meters from the goal Chelsea in the result of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He transferred the ball to his left leg before he kicked her toward the opposite stairway.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually fled the Kepaj Arrizabalaj which jumped towards her and entered the network.
"It was difficult to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led by 1:0 in half after the hit of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker passed the ball back to Mate Kovačić during that game before he turned somewhere in half of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball on the net on the opposite stairway next to Liverpool's goalie, Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Napoli in the League of Champions at 3:00 on Wednesday at Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples in Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3:00 a.m. Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state's disaster office said Sunday morning.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that it was reported that a large number of people were trapped in the buildings' ruins after an earthquake of $7.5 that felt on Friday and caused waves of height up to 6 metres.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the rest of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a female body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old girl was found at 7:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people from the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to turn to us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who think they know this woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said that the notification process is ongoing and the notification process of the nearest relatives of the victim.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed into the building or out of it.
He lost his word when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told that it will take several hours until they can return to their apartments.
A police officer allegedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at a crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 2:00 in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another one was parked right outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and controlled the housing block.
Of all those who have any information, they were asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, called 101 or an anonymous address to Creimestoppers at number 0800 555 111, calling for a record of 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument found in the middle of a debate on "dispute history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the nearly Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupid" and "trying to end history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate currently being conducted in connection with the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the character Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace became the subject of debate.
Iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his father Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful survival of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the way the 19th century thinks and part of the history of the person many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, the defenders of parliament from external pressure.
Whether it is a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historic debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protectors remain worthy of honor and marking."
A killer pig killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, it attacked and killed a farmer at a market in the southwest of China.
A man named only "Yuan" was found dead-cut arteries and covered with blood near the stand at the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, Jutarnji list of southern China announced on Sunday.
The pig breeder was preparing to vaccinated pigs in a pigsty on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
Apparently, he arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilos bit the breeder to death.
The evening news suggests that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
The security camera footage showed Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje news that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else while the police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although that rarely happens, pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked her wife and her wife at their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig plowed a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitobe told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They are only played.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to be shown respect," he said.
The remains of hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, hurricane Rosa weakens as it passes over the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
But during the following days Rosa will bring flood rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa blew at 5am East Time at a speed of 140 km/h, making it a hurricane 1st category, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, a low pressure area is created and moves to the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to suppress a deep layer of tropical moisture in the north-west direction of the United States.
Rosa will bring up 250 mm rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Thereafter, tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause strong rainfalls to occur in much of the southwest.
In local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, mudholes and possible slides in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause a rainfall of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
More than 25 to 100 mm rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
The floods may occur with rapid deterioration of the conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
There is no counsel to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild river, and thunder showers will bring local stormy winds and dusty forks.
Approaching low pressure areas will bring local heavy rains on parts of the coast of southern California.
Possible collapses in a quantity greater than 12 mm, which can cause less muddy bulge and slippery road.
It will be the first rainfall in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday nights and Monday mornings before they cover the wider area at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the state of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are being touched and will last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes across the United States are possible as Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes it leads to dramatic changes in temperature at low distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The difference in temperature between Kansas City in Missouri, Omahe in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the frozen summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm from 27 degrees from southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great possibility beyond the average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks a tense testimony of candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of having a sexual assault reportedly occurred in the '80s.
Meanwhile, political reckoning continued, and reporters interrupted a regular programme to notify the turning point at the last moment of Friday: a deal reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court board that he was absolutely sure Kavanaugh was intoxicating her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning testimony that he was absolutely certain that it had not happened.
Friday's hearing was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for other networks that transmitted the hearing was not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people who watch content in offices.
To give you better evidence, it's about a audience that's similar to the one watching American football play or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million, and CNN, 2.52 million.
The profession remained great even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After that moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS's cameras on Friday morning, they recorded him yelling at protesters while trying to go to the Justice Committee's hearing with the elevator.
For a few minutes there was a downed view while in front of CNN's live cameras, the protesters were killing him with their sins.
"I am standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office published a statement even before the elevator door closed that they would say more at the committee hearing.
Hours later, all cable and television networks were monitored live when the Justice Committee should have voted in favour of sending Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate's entire vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against candidates during the next week, requiring democratics who are minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Cons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuse critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her EU exit plan to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in the second interview with her on the cover, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other for customs charges "complete nonsense".
Wade Simms' murder: police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspect in LSU's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained in custody on charges of murder from the incursion, police administration of Baton Rouge said.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, a CBS branch, reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
A $350,000 guarantee was requested.
On Friday, the municipality's coroner's office of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanks the task force for the fugitives of the federal state police of Louisiana, the federal police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for implementing the law on "sustainability and search for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player on his lap, 183 cm tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said the team is "sad" and "in shock" over Wade's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
The Vulcan casts ash on Mexico City
The ashes that cast out the volcano of Popocatapetl reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention centre on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the accelerator and registered 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was tracking multiple beatings and tremors.
The images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windscreens of a car in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geofisicists note the increased activity of volcanoes located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since the 2017 Magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists face an anniversary of voting on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocated independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined anti-demonstrations to mark the Catalan polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked Separatists who prevented intervention police began to shoot police officers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fights broke out later on the day the police used bats to calm the fight.
During several hours, the independence groups were running "There is no forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and against them the unionists cried "For a long time lived in Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries during the demonstration, local press reported.
The tensions in the region that weigh independence have not shrunk for a year after the October 1st referendum that Madrid has declared illegal, which the Catalan Separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters chose independence even though the turnout was small because those who are against secession mainly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce conflicts last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
The groups that advocate independence spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the demonstrations of separatists along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
"We experienced one of the best times last year.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, although a close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan's independence parties have been able to hold momentum this year because their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial due to their role in organising referendums and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of police support, said the conflict prompted politicians both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been investigating prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidate for European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car into the house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after several times they crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place Thursday around 19.30 BST in Ballinagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammmings said the yard door and the building were damaged.
It's possible that at some point, a crossbow was fired on a car.
Menge's shot brought Livingston a win over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
The first dolly mange goal for Livingston has won
The new Scottish Premiership League Club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to confess his only second defeat of the 18th Club head of the Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team settled with Iberian in a second.
Gerard's team is still without winning the guests at the Premiership this season, and the next Saturday they play against the Hearts, the leading club in the league for which eight points are lagging behind.
Before that, Rangers will join the Rapid Vienna Club as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Missed Chances Against Deadly Guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they scored that hit, considering their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was slow on his way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he slipped to intercept the head of Craig Halkettt towards the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to the guests
And that's exactly how a key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free shot, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisted Mengi together, who hit the middle of the goal.
Until then, the Rangers mostly had control over the ball, but they faced impenetrable domestic defenses, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
That continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
The feet of the Rangers Allan McGregor have prevented Scott Pittman, and Lithgow has directed a broad blow from another organised assault on Livingston.
The long pass was not able to cross a goal line of Livingston, and two eleven were not assigned – after Halkett's conflict with the substitute player Glen Middleton and one for playing hand.
"Great" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Great game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on that entry path.
Their style of games and staff have hardly changed since their return to large clubs, but great credit goes to Holta and the way he united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Meng wouldn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Warral have any rest.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set up a good game under Gerard.
They only opened a hole in the home team once, and it's a kind of call to stand up for the Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), there was a lot of smiles under the clear sky when the leader of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany – whose goal is to repair relations between NATO allies.
They differed in opinions on issues involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey lives in the city.
Police have blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of presidents who have come to see him have appeared nearby.
And hundreds of protesters from the opposition Erdogan -- a large number of Kurds -- have raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's politics and decision by the German government to welcome him to the country.
Controversies reflect the division caused by a visitor, whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others attack as highways.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn, on the road with dense traffic in Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred several months after the death of another cyclist after a collision and escape from the crash site at Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
City police said police officers were trying to identify a man and inform his closest relatives.
Due to the accident, roads have been closed and bus traffic has been rerouted, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a male prison of a closed-down guy.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
Special Tornado units have been brought in to contain riots involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were provided assistance due to minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "The specially trained prison staff has been engaged to resolve the Long Lartin prison incident.
Six staff members received assistance for the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we clearly want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be committed to the police and that they could spend longer behind bars."
In Long Lartin prison, there are over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were called into prison to solve a serious situation in which personnel were attacked with pool balls.
hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with lush floods (possibly useful for dry areas)
It's rare that tropical depression hits Arizona, but there's a chance that that's exactly what's going to happen at the beginning of next week when hurricane Rosa, with the remaining power, passes across the Desert Southwest and poses a threat to the floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings about the floods for Monday and Tuesday in the Western Arizona area, via southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with the rain and cross straight over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix stated in its tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have produced a tropical storm or depression within 320 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
The hurricane Katrina (1967) went 40 miles from Arizona's border."
The latest model of the National Center for hurricanes envisions 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with an insulated volume of up to 150 mm on the coast of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including Stjenjak and the Great Pool, there is a probability of rainfall from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated totals of up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of the lush floods, Rosa could come as a salvation because the region was affected by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, a portion of these rainfalls could be useful because in the southwest, the drought is currently dry.
"According to the American map of dry areas, a little more than 40% of Arizona has been affected by at least extreme drought, second highest category," saidweather.com
The hurricane path first approached the coast along the Mexican Baja California peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and was moving north at 20 km per hour.
The storm has run into colder waters of the Pacific and has thus weakened.
It is therefore expected that on Monday afternoon or evening, Mexico's coast will be neared by the power of a tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant threat to floods.
"The amount of total rainfall expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonor is 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," the weather reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and South Utah until Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or its remains is very heavy rains on the Baja California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the US Desert Southwest," the National Center for hurricanes said.
These rains are expected to cause a life-threatening flood and a bulge of mud in the deserts and rinks on the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset with stab wounds.
About 45.00 BST on Saturday in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, was found a injured teenager.
He was taken to the hospital and in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset police department said 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called to report to all those who have footage of the event.
Trump claims Kavanaugh has endured the wickedness and rage of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the democratic Democratic Party's cruel and shameful tactics," Trump said at a pre-election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "took the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nominacian process.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before Congress and decidedly and emotionally rejected the charges of Christine Blasey Ford for a sexual assault ten years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at a hearing about the accusation she made.
On Saturday, the president said that the "American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for confirming Judge Kavanaugh's voice is for confirming one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service," he said to gathering supporters in Western Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' election in half of the presidential term.
"Five weeks share us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed the Democratic mission was to "make resistance and obstruction".
A Republican leadership assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to grow
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of which drew the huge waves that struck the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Pala on Friday, when at duress waves of heights hit the coast, dragging many of them to death and tearing everyone on their way.
Canami followed an earthquake of 7.5 Magnitude.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and were killed," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency to ease the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he pulled cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos from the air published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPT) announced in its statement that the energy freed by Friday's massive earthquake corresponded to the 200-fold nuclear bomb force of Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the force of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that some victims' bodies were found trapped beneath the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications have been completely interrupted and we have no information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in this area," says a statement from the Red Cross, adding that staff and volunteers have headed to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms over the non-proliferation of information that tsunamis hit Pala, although officials claim the waves came as soon as the warning was issued.
In the amateur video shared on social networks you can hear a man on the top floor of the building panicically warning people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall came down to the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The Reuters Agency could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquakes and tsunamis caused the power shortages that caused the break in communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue action.
According to the military authorities, cargo planes were launched with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still needy food and other necessary supplies.
The city airport was reopened for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palou on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has taken more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived successfully in the town of Pala, where employees were put into Tarpaulin tents in the courtyard of their office, they passed the scenes of destruction on their way," Mr Doseb said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched disaster relief wheels, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have disabled their arrival in Pal.
According to Indonesian rules of financing, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says "All right, it's a national disaster" we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on the Palace on Friday, friends and families of those still thought to be missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that alleviate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was saved from the sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those captured at the Roo Roo Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"In view of many years spent in the paragliding, I am carrying my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the destruction of the Roa Roo Hotel, which spread to the paraglider community, he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to competitions from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray clutch, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took away 26.750 U.S. dollars while filling ATMs downtown Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26.750 U.S. US employees from Brink's employees who filled a ATM in Newport on the Levee, a press release from the Newport Police Administration said.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement said that the car driver had emptyed the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man "came to the race to Brink's employee behind his back" and stole a bag of money that was to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses have noticed several suspicious persons fleeing the scene, but police have not listed the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In Saturday's post on Twitter, which announced the change, he wrote: "The living will be officially known as Kanye West."
The West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of its eighth album published in June.
The change comes before his tour of the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to launch his new album Yandi.
The show's authors said he replaced the singer Arian Grande who cancelled for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being short of his current artistic name, West said earlier that the word had religious meaning for him.
"I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “ti”," West said earlier this year in a discussion on the title of his album with radio leader Big Boy.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It started with Kanya, which means “one thing” in just Ye – it's a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything inside us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And once West's associate, Jay-Z, played with the versions of his name without a dash and a dash and written in large letters.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use military against citizens
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's candidate has promised never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use an army against the Mexican people."
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations in that square on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people at the moment the leftist student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attracts young criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in that area," said the investor in artificial intelligence and expert on that area, Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans concerning artificial intelligence, although the US in principle lacks formal strategy regarding artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the first AI-innovation country by 2030.
"A double increase in the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next great discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"A double increase in investment could double the chance that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the US," Lee said this week in a interview with CNBC.
Lee whose book: “AI Enlargess: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” published this month by Houdon Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American game player Othelo, and later he was director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised the previous American government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked the question when will be held next in order to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It is not China that takes academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on researching artificial intelligence over recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese National Council announced the development plan for the next generation in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions similar to that of the National Science Foundation and other state organisations providing financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose was to include partners in the activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he is currently investing over $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Saturday to change their country's name to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia". It is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and which has blocked Greece from opening accession negotiations to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece, arguing that its northern neighbour's name is the property of its territory and vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycotting campaign has cast doubts about whether the exit will meet the minimum 50 per cent needed to make the referendum valid.
The issue on the referendum ballot said: "Are you for NATO and EU membership while agreeing with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for in order for one of the countries created after the breakup of Yugoslavia to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Oliver Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, parliament members said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported until 13 hours.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, joined Strumica on 30 September 2018 a referendum on changing the name of the country, opening the way for NATO to join the Alliance and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, in front of parliament in Skopje, set up a small stage and received chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us under the name Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring so much needed investment in Macedonia, a country in which the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a "positive" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute last Monday shows that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the necessary response.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, output must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defense to score a hit.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling in Manchester on Saturday broke into Brighton's defense in England and won a 2 :0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguero's victory made it insanely simple, reaching a hit at 65 minutes.
The Argentinan attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defense players and then hit the open ground.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four rival players in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders, then caught up with a few others on the verge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English gunman from the first attempt returned the Aguer ball, which put the right swimball in the right side of the net and defeated Brighton's porter Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulties with his foot," the Manchester City Manager, Pep Guardiola, reported.
"We planned to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a hit at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Primer League.
That hit was reached in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's field during that game.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful ball along the left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling to the stairway.
The Sky Blues shooter put the ball in the net just before slipping into the car.
Manchester City fights the Hoffenheims in the League of Champions group game Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Germany's Synsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable the progress of Rockies
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from playing, there was not too much reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitively, Scherzer hopes for Sunday's victory against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, win the playoffs.
On Friday night, the Rockies won 5 : 2 over the Nationals at least provided a place in wild-card playing, but they still hope to win their first title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw out knowing what the atmosphere is like here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why should I not want to compete?"
The Nationals still have to publish a Sunday starter, but they are reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer a game.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, was warmed up in the pitcher area Thursday and will play Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington rightist in this season achieved a score of 18 :7 percent of the race won (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 two-thirds.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters' turnout in general elections, the president in turn commented on his selection of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court.
"All we have done will be tested in November.
It's five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones -- I didn't run, but I'm actually in a race, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control; that's why they want power and control.
Democrats, he says, have a mission "to resist and interfere".
"You have seen this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the angry, the evil, the corrupt and the lying".
He has released Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee by name, which has caused a loud disapproval of the audience.
"Do you remember her response?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document -- it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
It does not tolerate personal attitudes
I wasn't too surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour Party MPs who are said not to be welcome – and all because of what we have said in mind.
According to my fellow MPs, Joan Ryan was similar because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbin disagreed with previous leadership.
On Friday's announcement of the Labour Party's meeting, Nottingham said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local representative of the Labour Party meetings of the main council on Friday nights were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings have passed in a different tone today, and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as I felt that we were sharing similar political opinions with me had begun to require a drastic change of opinion and taking views that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was a national security or a single EU market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there are a bunch of offensive words on social networks that are called by my recalling the policies of the centre and telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had better luck than some of my colleagues since the comments I've been given are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a lion of sexistic or racist comments every day, but they never do.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me most is tolerating offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal of non-trust or change of election rules, we become a more narrower party.
Many times in the last two years they've advised me to put my head down, not to be so loud and tell me that then everything will be okay."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, I have been encouraged by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school's multi-purpose classroom to fail, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them – either as a local councillor or minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been mistaken about my political stances and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported Friday's proposal is that, at the moment the country is swimming towards Brexit, which will negatively reflect on households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituency, whether it's about members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats by recall or political benefit will deter me from acting as I believe in your best interests.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr heading towards the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day at Tennet's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and are the only ones undefeated by ten teams.
After all, top defenses and better opportunities led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we have been tested at every game and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie at the Melrose Club said, "Every honour to Ayra, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's trial at 14 minutes, which was realized by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise results, and Jason Baggot used an unrealised attempt.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayr to the eleven before, at the halftime, he scored and realized an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr to 17:5 before the break.
But Melrose started well at the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, who realized Baggett, reduced his advantage to five points.
Then there was a long break because of the serious injury Ruardh Knott was taken on the stretchers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued to play a good game by the attempt of Stafford McDowall who realised Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card and Melrose again made an extra player pay, and it unrealised by Bruce Colvine's attempt at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
A lateral player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for the crash of Clim who had no ball; with the line for a criminal blow, MacPherson performed the laying behind Ayra in full swing of the breach.
Climo realized that he had done it almost since the beginning, after Kyle Rowe had received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent a lateral player, Gregor Henry, in the fifth attempt by the domestic team.
The Star of Still Game seems ready for a new career in restaurant activities
Ford Kiernan, the star of Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in service activities after it has been discovered to be appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC series whose screenplay is also one of the stars, along with a long-standing comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The double announced that the coming ninth season will be the last to appear, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will assign her a way out to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the sea center full of cranes in La Paz.
A flag of ocean color has been reported on public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazona ori are wings: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In all of Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in favor of Chile during the conflict due to resources in the 19th century is still alive – just as the longing for the re-floats of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting a verdict by the International Court of Justice, expected on October 1st, after a five-year trial, and hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the International Court of Justice's verdict on big screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's view that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the introduction of a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here's Morales, Bolivian charismatic autochton president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from Monday's verdict.
"We are near the return of the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge in favour of Bolivia and that little would change if so.
The UN-based body in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The verdict of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearings means that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interest, they may have been backwards for the last four years.
"The question of access to the sea has adopted the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has buried every good will of Chile, she thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has made an unusually fast decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "interrupt 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales -- still one of the most favorite presidents in Latin America -- used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't reach nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never be nuclearally disarmed if they can't trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
The commentary was addressed at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be inclined to restart diplomatic talks on nuclear issues, which comes more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says sanctions continued because of "revelations of imaginations" and that the US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will certainly not cast the North on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pjongyang taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting at the top.
But there is a broad presence of skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongang to give up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second encounter of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show discovers that the last line of large head coverings on the road to a luxury store in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely cover the sun, don't look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the fashion runway a line of decomposed giant head coverings for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and excited style lovers at Paris Week fashion.
Extraordinarily impractical hats have washed Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that draw attention to the runway.
The example that stood out was Valentino, and it's a large beige hat decorated with a wide range like feathers that completely "taken over" the head of the model.
Other huge accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even ananas, but those accessories were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a breather and a mask, and the other one looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow a great fashion statement, happiness is on your side.
Styleists predict that huge hats could come to luxury shops in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly with the heels "La Bomb", a straw hat with a range of approximately 60 cm wide which was seen on many famous and famous persons, from Rihanna to Emily Rataykowski.
The cool brand behind an extremely impractical hat that subdued the social networks on the runway sent another great creation – a straw bag for the beach almost as large as the model in the bathing suit that wore it.
Exhaust orange bag, decorated with rafi and white leather lunch, was an exhibition piece in the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 at Paris Week fashion.
Stillist of celebrities, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury shops for next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories."
John Edward: The linguistic skills the citizens of the world need
Scotland's independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary exams, and the additional weight is given by individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want to make them to the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the above mentioned school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired subject of school selection.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you turn to a man who understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in your mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the most reviews in the languages have been achieved by students of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who taught foreign languages received excellent reviews.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent assessment of the Mandarin language, while 72% of students who teach German, 69% of students who learn French and 63% of Spanish students also received the highest possible rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today languages as election items are considered as important as STEM items (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
The survey carried out by the United Kingdom for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to lack of labor with linguistic skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for the preparation of youth for careers.
Since more and more jobs are being sought for language knowledge, skills are crucial in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of careers, people who have learned to speak foreign languages in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks several languages can communicate directly with foreigners, which gives her the advantage of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov, in 2013, more than 4,000 adults participated, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know foreign languages well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of respondents, more precisely 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for children today.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers many languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their programme, while others will decide on languages that are considered to be most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are professional in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools provide children with an environment in which learning will prepare and arm the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future prepares for us.
It cannot be ignored that today global language knowledge is very important for every country's future so that it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, the knowledge of modern languages should indeed be seen as “the international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
I'll fatten the faire.
John Edward is head of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools
LeBron will play Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first show for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said at Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell announced tweet that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in Lakers, which consisted of six games.
"I really don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, a channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign with numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned meetings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet given his vote for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose most in Congress after the November vote.
What time begins tonight's Trump rally in West Virginia and how can you look at it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours in Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump's meeting in West Virginia online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearing of the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh's candidates who have caused controversy over sexual abuse charges.
But the primary objective of this set of meetings is to help Republicans get the advantage of the November elections.
Therefore, from Trump's headquarters for the presidential campaign, five meetings scheduled for next week aim to "stimulate volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Most in Congress is so important to the president's plans that it will travel to as many countries as we enter a burning campaign," Reuters anonymous spokesman Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Tonight's event in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month. In 2016, he won more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morris that the president must help him improve the ranking in the polls," politicallogist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia for Reuters said.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team left its heart on the ground before individual clashes on Sunday
After the three one-sided couples match Sunday afternoon, maybe it's just what Ryder Cup was supposed to turn around.
"The wheel of happiness turns around" is a saying that is particularly true in sports and that athletes believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who is the wheel of happiness now favored?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are in favour of four points, while there are 12 points left until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouraging his game in pairs with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after the entire day's game.
Spieth played murderous from Tee to Green and could serve as an example to others.
The cheerleading screams grew louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path that Spieth had come to an unsolved result.
After the trip he won the game with 15 holes, he followed a similar cheerleading roar that could identify hope and faith that Americans could turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
Those players are the only ones left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a sensational Ryder Cup.
The European weird, but the adorable couple have a maximum number of points and can't be wrong.
"Molliwood" is the only couple that didn't lose a point Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back Nina on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy connecting Fleetwood and Molinari, shows that just those players that are to be won on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of Europeans as the sun sets over Paris' Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time at different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took out Alex Noren and Sergi Garcia, who had a great performance in this morning's pair game.
One bogey and two double bogies at the first nine holes on the playground buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't dig out.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one who will help individuals dig out of their holes.
It's fascinating to watch games of couples up close because you can see the interactions of players in pairs, hear the advice they give and those they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can change at the moment.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and in the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary fight, in which some, in particular, Statesidens have doubted.
Europeans enter the last day of Ryder Cup with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's games in pairs on the last day of Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the United States of 10:6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led by four points difference on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy she had escaped in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs, achieving a score of 3: 1.
The American team has shown greater combat in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points has already been great.
To win the team's trophy, Jim Furyk should collect eight points in the 12 single games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debuter from the European team to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend only the second couple who won four points in the game in pairs in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved superior in the game against Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games has made some brilliant moves, but now he has 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to get back in the game with Henry Stanson and win 2 & 1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans did not go as smooth during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
The triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and thus set a scale high to their American team.
First, they defeated Spanishman Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2 & 1 in fourballs, and then defeated Potter and Rory Mcllroy with 4 & 3 in pairs after the first two holes were lost.
Twice throughout the history of Ryder Cupa's team that was behind four points managed to return to individual games, although Furyk's team only needs an unsolved score to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, it seems that their weekly counter-attack will be difficult to drop.
North Korea announces that "no chance" for unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that further sanctions would increase confidence in the United States and that there was no way that North Korea would unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill", for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, demonstrated the nuclear test station and decided to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"But we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust in the United States, we don't have faith in our national security, under such circumstances there's no way that we're going to be the first one-sided disarmament."
Although Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea on Washington's resistance to "perpetitive" access to denuclarisation in which North Korea would gradually abolish sanctions, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current president of the United States and the leaders of North Korea in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim made a promise to work on the "denocuting of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted between 1950 and 1953, but the United States had conditioned that Pyongyang would first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also ignored calls for the reduction of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that a denuclearisation be carried out first and increase pressure with sanctions in order to force its goal, and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is only the delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump that the president of the United Nations spoke of in early weeks.
But the minister stressed that Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in had held three meetings in the last five months and added: "If denuclearisation had sought South Korea, not the United States, the denuculation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt."
Nevertheless, Minister Rio's tone of speech was very different from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental US missiles was inevitable after the evil president Trump called Kim "a human rocket" on a suicidal mission.
Trump, who threatened last year with the "complete destruction" of North Korea this year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage for disarmament, but added that there are still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea does its denuclearisation.
Trump said on Wednesday there is no time frame for denutrition and added, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed their view that the UN Security Council should be rewarded for measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until full, final and verified denucularisation occurs."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an effort to halt the financing of a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pjongjiang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after several hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea has arranged a meeting with Moon this month to demonstrate the missile location and nuclear complex that will come true if the United States takes "responsible measures".
He added that Kim revealed to him that these "responsible measures" refer to security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course where they learn how to get a good rest
A new class at Harvard University enabled all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to fight an increasingly widespread culture of learning along with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academic found that students at the world’s best university often have no idea of the basics of self care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital Hospital, designed a course that he believes is the first of those species in the United States.
The idea of the course came after he gave a speech about the effect of sleep depression on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came to me and said, "Why did I find out this just now, in my last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
The first course this year explains to students how good sleeping habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health at Paul Barreira University says the university decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student dormitory where students have to click coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success and how important sleep routine is.
During the course of the lecture, students also learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, the map of campuses with interactive icons encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on all night learning before the exam continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
The professor says that a secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality dream. Sleeping also helps to fight thickness because lack of sleep affects the brain, inserts it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry student and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler make a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand his course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive establishment.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" which emit electronic devices screens, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadia rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin naked defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the shot of Dolly Menge cut off Steven Gerrard's missing defense and finished the game by winning Livingston with a score of 1 :0.
The guys from Ibrox wanted to win the first victory after the triumph in February and score 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team now lagged eight points in Ladbrokes Premiership for leading Hearts.
Menga achieved an event seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to have lost their inspiration and did not seem to equalize the result.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbed on the third with only one incident behind the Hibernian.
There may be new problems for the Rangers after Line Judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on his hips and so went against Ayr to the semifinals of Betfred's bath.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same cast of Livingston that last week the Hearts took a measure and would be thrilled that his well-designed squad choked on every attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more ball in possession, but Livingston with her has achieved more.
They had an opportunity to happen two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game that opened space for Scott Pittman to head for the goal of Allan McGregor, however, the bondsman missed the opportunity.
The deep free blow of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an impeccable blow to the back lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos must have thought the judge should have tried to judge him in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not respect the Colombian request.
In the first half, the Rangers managed only two balls to the goal, but the former Ibrox porter Liam Kelly was hit by Lassan Coulibaly's head and the pie hit by Ovie Ejari did not pose a major problem.
Although the 34-minute playoff of Livingston slowed down the game, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers have again failed to use the deep Jacobs back ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his privacy and chose Mengu to easily end the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had the current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett suffered a long blow after each other.
Holt's side could have extended the leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide entry from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an 11-year-old because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson took a look this time.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, following the page from our Almanac on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans Geiger" in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as Geiger counter.
In 1950, Geiger’s counter became the main foothold of pop culture, for example in the film “Bells of Colorado” in which the main roles had seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in God’s name is that? ”
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s counter, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, you can hear it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure includes the extraction of immune system cells from the patient and their changes in the laboratory
The cells are treated to be able to "recognise" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-injection in the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune system cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory to ‘recognise’ protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers and re-injection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in the state of Bethesda in the state of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach to extracting immune system cells from the patient and learning how to identify cancer cells was successful in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in the Trump debate after hosting the show Saturday Night Live and supported it, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's Do America Big Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was prominent in the study during the Saturday Night Live show after performing with the interruptions in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for President 2020.
After performing a third evening song called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat entitled "Let's Make America Big Again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist."
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the US Senate Justice Committee on the claims of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech on social networks was transmitted by comedian Chris Rock.
There's no telling if the announcement of Rock was trying to make West look bad.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was being handed over behind the stage for the hat he was wearing.
"I was harassed behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I'm being bullied!
They said I sank," the Washington Examiner quoted him as saying.
West continued, "You want to see the bottom?" and said he would wear his Superman cloak because that means I can't tell him what to do. You want the world to advance?
Try with love."
Variety magazine wrote that his comments at least twice caused public dissatisfaction, and the members of Saturday Night Live appeared embarrassed, while one magazine person said, "The studio has been quieted down."
West was called at the last minute as a replacement for the singer Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
The West was performed by performing a song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of mineral water Perrier, astounded many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the conservative TPUS group, who announced on Twitter: "One of the bravest people: thank you for agreeing to the Mafia."
But the head of Karen Hunter's Twitter show announced that West was simply "your own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he accepts and expands the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We did, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying he is now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased musical legend Prince changed her name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.

The star of the series Game of the throne Kit Harrington turned to toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jon Snow who barats the sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of the Throne.
But a 31-year-old actor went after a stereotype of hero macho, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they must be firm in order to gain respect.
In a discussion with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the series Game of Capitals, admitted that he wanted to "very determined" to face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where have we sinned with masculinity?" he wondered.
"What have we taught men as they grew up, compared to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very masculine characters on the screen, could partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets, and that makes the boys feel like they have to have these certain lines of men?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not record the sequels to the game of the throne after its conclusion next summer and said he had "ending with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will play in the new performance of True West's theatre performance by Sam Shepherd, a story of a film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the shooting of the throne game.
"I met my wife filming that show, which gave me a family and a future life," he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic show that won the Emmy Award playing Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/SIDA: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced that 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Healthcare workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of infection were transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted across some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, Chinese health authorities said that HIV infected people are almost gone in this way.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV virus by sex is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination of LGBT is a large person.
Studies estimate that because of conservative values in the country, 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to deal with this problem, the Chinese government pledged free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public has provided information on GOP senators, calling it "a dangerous lie" and "theories of conspiracy"
US MP Maxine Walters denied Saturday allegations that a member of her staff published personal data to three Republican senators on Wikipedia's website.
A Democratic agent from Los Angeles assures that the claims spread by individuals of the "ultra right wing", as well as the website.
"It lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information on the network appeared on Thursday and was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the Senate committee's hearing on claims of sexual misdemeanor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Preservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of publication of these data belongs to the Office of Representative Waters, as well as information about the staff member, the newspaper The Hill reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false allegations – is in no way responsible for leaking these data.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs Waters' statement quickly attracted critics to the Internet, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temper to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do must not be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
It must be calm and steady."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Barbara Walters with the criticisms that Democrats refer to Judge Kavanaugh, who were accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes against Waters in the general elections, also appeared on Twitter.
"It is important if it is true," he wrote.
Waters stated in her statement that her office has informed "measures and order bodies" about these false claims.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are discovered and they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
"Johnny English: Again on Task" review – not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson fights spies
Now it is already common in every new British film to search for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is also in the new screenplay of the action series "Johnny English" whose first extension, called "Johnny English", was first shown in 2003 and returned in 2011 to large screens titled "Johnny English is riding again".
Will the wrapped own satire about how clearly worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Incapacitated Johnny English eyes and rubber face again has a license to complicated the situation, while his name says more than anything that is about a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a detached secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretentations of "divided" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a breath of character Mr Bean and somewhat resembles that guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games 2012.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclay and which is the appearance of chaos.
There's one or two hot moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English got close to a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller hit his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusually superior, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Impossible missions" and themselves offer elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children, not adults. In my opinion, the long-lost stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as those of Atkinson's silent gegs entangled in Mr Bean's character.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a general fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British spy web site and discovered the identities of all British agents, the horror of an agent on duty, which, unfortunately, is being played by Kevin Eldon in short appearance.
It has shed a glass of the prime minister's patience, a superior and wartime character who experiences the complete decomposition of the system because it is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying faithfully to display a character who should represent Theresa May, but she has not quite received material to do something with.
Intelligence consultants reveal that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English with his head and beard, who is currently employed as headmaster of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: here he has several hot georges because English teaches to spy in rocking style.
The English quickly bring to the government's premises for an emergency meeting, where they meet again with Bough, their former partner and their eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander, played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential has been largely wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who do everything completely wrong are returning to action and meeting the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelija Bulletov, who was embezzled by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Walt playing Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey along with absurd and ridiculous occasions: disguised as waiters lit up a fancy French restaurant, causing a huge mess smuggled on Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use headphones for virtual reality to find out what the interior of the Voltina house looks like.
It's all done properly for this last sequel, but as much as the film is attractive and flimsy, it still contains the quality of children's elements.
Quite a mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I was wondering again, could the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to develop a plan for the British to work four days a week and get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin will consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid for five days of work.
The party reportedly wants companies' heads to pass on savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources suggest that the idea could be "accomplished" in the party's economic programme and plans for the country to bow to workers' interests.
The union congress supported the transfer to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from change in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not happen overnight, but it is a tendency that fits into the approach that this party has to balance the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to give its support to such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept that tendency.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party does not consider it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to seize power from the hands of "no-good principals" and "profitters" in the utility companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire stakes because the Labour Government could make "rejections" on the basis of observed irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in the management boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 per cent of private companies' capital to employees, which would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and asks whether the Agency's conclusion can affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would reveal something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said going to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened after they were brought up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, undecided, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, as if it were carved into stone.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and it should indeed be a strong accusation to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett has all been determined to deny it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything's changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has he achieved anything about reducing poverty?
These Saturdays New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Posty Project project, an international conspiracy group in hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they were not willing to pay VIP tickets), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, e-mailing to world leaders, phone calls or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, considering that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case called "cliticism" – where people feel that by signing an online petition or sending tweets, they really change something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has argued that he has recorded more than 19 million "action" of his supporters who have sought to achieve a series of different objectives.
He claims that these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that would result in more than $37 billion that will have an impact on the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partner of investors and contractors in the United Kingdom who advocates "helping children to develop to their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world will provide $35 million to help Rwanda to end malnutrition in that area.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition only becomes a footnote in history," said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of the Foundation "The Power of Nutrition", audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project to provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website, which reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?,
Global Citizen answers: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road, ” we will sometimes experience failure.
But we will succeed, as great moves for civil rights and against apartheids before us have succeeded, because we are stronger together.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weekda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belong to some of the performances at this year's event in New York that will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy as a "blockad" to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke said that the Russian engagement in Syria is especially where he acts on the call of the legitimate government to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
But in his view, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the assistance of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime roads and roadblocks, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the event hosted by a non-profit group of Consumer Energy Alliance, which was represented in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel consumption and replacement," he said, and told Russia that it is "served by the same trick" in economies dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at the same time with the intention of Trump's administration to increase exports to Europe of its embedded natural gas, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In that sense, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (Northern Stream 2), which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "emergence" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply encouraged by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has triggered a reaction to Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Senator of the state of Massachusetts
State Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "really consider" the presidential bid after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering himself running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means women to head," The Hill quoted him as saying.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during his meeting with the citizens, saying "this country leads in the wrong direction".
"I am terribly concerned that Donald Trump is doing our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published Friday, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll released Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at Suffolk University / Boston Globe, 50 per cent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be running.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's bid, with 38 per cent vote for potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
The other prominent names of the Democrats discussed in connection with a potential race for the president in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after reporting in September.
A domestic violence incident that took place Monday night was also arrested.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are going through," said the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that he was silent about both his son and other war veterans said they were "returning a little bit different, returning hard, returning to wonder if there was respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots had given for this country," and all the other members of the army.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and has been charged with family violence against a woman, obstructing the application of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, says Dan Bennett, spokeswoman of the Waxille Police Department.
18 federal states and D.C. support review of new asylum policy
The 18 states and the Columbia District support the legal challenge of the new US policy that is denying asylum to victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who dispute politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against the Sessions that the US Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers came in the United States, as countries facing all the problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new asylum policy in the United States has changed the Committee on Immigration's decision adopted in 2014 that allows immigrants who do not have documents and who flee from domestic violence to submit an asylum application.
Colombian State Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignorates decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law states that all asylum requirements are resolved on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court friend's report said.
The lawyers further argued that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering the US economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
Chief Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum in June to victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, faith, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his statement on politics on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems ` Not even all the serious problems ’ that people meet every day around the world.
Desperately rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Ris Kusum, while comforting her boy who was shaking in a fever at the evacuation center in the devastated town of Palou.
"Vehicles of emergency assistance every minute of the transport of bodies.
The government lacks clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, sifting through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, were cramped.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, rested in front of the Palou Military Hospital, where patients were treated in the open because of continued severe subsequent earthquakes.
The tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was bent inside the ruins of the wall," said Harris for Associated Press, and added that his family had come into town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then the silence came.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "maltretating" through "propagand ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published four pages of a long ad in the American daily that promoted the mutual benefit of US and Chinese trade, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of abuse of American propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to China Daily's paid allowance in Iowa's most sold newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the US congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US elections marked what US officials in Reuters' statement described as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to post commercial promotions, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's revenges in the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and formerly longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "now doubles this abuse by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the expansion of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find limited votes of opposition in Beijing and you will not see any genuine reflection of different opinions that the Chinese people may have on a disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under solid pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspapers were in question.
Kavanaugh's debacle Republicans removed voters from mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans stand by for the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and defend him for several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event have been quite alarmed, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their vote.
Such things cannot be returned," Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at the Maxwell University Faculty of Syracuse, told an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon)'s last insistence on investigating the FBI would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday neither will they forget tomorrow nor in November," Karina Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the protest group MoveOn, quoted the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang: "Comes November!" protesting in the Senate hall while Republicans who control the Judicial Committee were preparing to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst told the news.
"People say they are already on a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among women in suburban and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by the Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest a negative reaction could occur if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
"It's a real mess for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but also about the way the Republicans approached all of it and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group that helped choose the Democrats, stressed.
But it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more strain on him.
A new poll published by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or likely believe the truthfulness of Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they were safe or likely to trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations Ford made, along with at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Justice Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court judge was showing her genitals at a party during a study in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet to download Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the inventor of World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming a Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that develops based on Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose a place to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt was "World Domination".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal network data storage" or "pod".
It may include contact lists, obligations lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is a decision on who can access what information is entirely users.
The company calls it "the personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a complete change in which all their business models would turn overnight completely.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a consortium of World Wide Web at the Massachusetts State Technology Institute (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt begins, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the World Wide Web Foundations and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of First World War priests Victoria Cross · Global Voices
Celebration in honor of the only priest of the Church of England that was decorated with Victoria's cross as a fighter in the First World War was similar in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him and never learned that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's venture to receive that recognition.
According to the London Gazette official newspaper, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across St Quentin's channel "through very dense fog and under strong fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machinery".
Later, he rushed to the front lines and with "unbelievable courage" led the task force forward before he stormed into the Polish cannon without anyone's help and cut three men from the military squad.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know that I could never achieve, and which triggers humility. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wedding after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band Parade.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored with his participation in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will receive."
Lovers of mixed martial arts remained awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they received a Prystic Peppu
Imagine this? Stay up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to make it impossible for you to follow the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in Great Britain were displayed at night live on channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Ggard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in Great Britain remained in shock when the transfer broke off with Praščić Peppa.
Many were not impressed at all after fighting only kept them awake until early morning.
One fan of breaking up child cartoons on Twitter described it as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to transfer to the children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president for marketing and communication Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Yuppie, "Pryscep Peppa."
Bellator's president, Scott Cocker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I consider reviewing, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But there's a transfer there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to realize anything until we have Sundays, when they'll already be there Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, they circled many correspondence that were not even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't.
I can promise you next time it won't come.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which we normally do, and we tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley, says he grew up with a sense of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he left for high school, he was unaware that "not everyone was like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, who runs Lauren Laverne, said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said his victory at the Olympics is less important since he became a father.
She took several months off because of her illness.
Turning up as an outcast in the first Laverna show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “Until today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to others were the real things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed.”
He says he wanted to prove he was "someone and something," so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A double winner of the bronze Olympic medal has become a prominent person who advocates LGBT and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt that he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When so young you go through so much," he referred to his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, saying it was difficult to find someone in the same age and experience similar ups and downs.
In June, they became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the talk would be about 'using to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than the gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they got tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was out, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of my home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.

Mickelson out of shape on a bench on Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to regain his form completely to avoid an awkward milestone.
Mickelson, who plays record 12th time in this two-year contest, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he often was for the United States, a five-fold winner spent a day in cheerleading and developing his game at the gym in hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for Le Golf National demanding ground, where long irregular terrain routinely punishes impeccable blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the exact British Open Francesco Molinarii champion, who won all four matches this week with the newest Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had more confidence in his man than that and he couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more of them, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's how we should do it.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said that his presence brought certain immaterial values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for that," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the individual match Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
Danac debuted in a match in Valderrama in 1997, where Captain Sevea Ballesteros' team had a five-point advantage against the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a close distinction from 14-to-one.
"You keep reminding us that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the team 2018 which won the score of 5 gnomes on Friday and yesterday led the result 10 ο 6 on the field Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play full power.
Get out of the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors are on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that leaves focus.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who's standing against the world's greatest players."
Enchanted by his players on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “In this I would never run before ore.
Tomorrow it's worth facing a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as an individual, they're at the ultimate test of your golfer skills.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, and she's that they have to do their best tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate because he must do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the other hand, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their teammates, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of these big turns of the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question that Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that run-off goes in a certain direction, he puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
According to that, we've organized our lineup and set the boys up like, you know, we're gonna try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a counter-attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Powell to face the rest of the Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going this order because I think it includes everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for individual matches.
German new warship again put on hold
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be released in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be ready until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading new frigate of the class Baden-Wuertemberg, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery struck the fate of an ambitious project.
Four class of Baden-Württemberg, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will be replaced by the old Bremen frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period ` the latest frigates should be possible over a period of up to two years without going back to the port of origin.
However, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships that are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power abroad will become obsolete by the time it enters the service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 reached all the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the ship's ship after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media cited numerous key "softer and hardware deficiencies" that would make warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software shortages were particularly important because the ships of the class Baden-Wuertemberg will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors á half as much as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is dramatically too heavy to reduce its efficiency and restricts the capacity of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the “Rheinland-Pfalz” of 7,000 tonnes is twice the size of ships similar to those used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the cost of the entire project is also becoming a problem, including crew training.
Prices are said to have reached a stunning 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) gnome compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was in fact "run out of ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem has increased over time, as the old ships have been placed out of operation and there are no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the class Baden-Württemberg could join the Navy.
The National Foundation is listening to the secret life of bats
The new research carried out on the property in Scotland is aimed at finding out how bats use landscapes to hunt food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help manage future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow the common and wetland dwarf bats, as well as brown long-mouthed and river bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special cameramen will be placed in key places around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile checks using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of the sound of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what kind of thing it does.
Then a map of habitats and reports will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the protection of the nature of the NTS, hopes to discover what habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest surfaces for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and work on the arrangement that affect shelters and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flies and certain chemical treatments of construction material, and attacks by pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles on the path of their flight.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspection of shelters and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threava estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where it lives eight of the ten bat species that originated in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there is much more that we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other facilities will help us understand better what they need for progress."
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work within buildings, since the accidental destruction of one leg can kill up to 400 females and young women, possibly destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Bat Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their population progresses."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as "false news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published those charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was charged with raping an American woman named Katherine Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after reporting charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticised allegations as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says a five-time gold ball winner in a camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything is good," he added a footballer with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy", Reuters writes.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "the moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years."
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reportedly returned to the football room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents submitted at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after an alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" is a "good guy" who was betrayed by that "one percent".
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was an agreement.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and photographed her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she "were afraid of revenge" and was concerned that she would be "publicly humiliated".
A 30-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing the Real Madrid from Manchester United during an alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a 100m-euro transition.
Brexit: UK will “repent forever” that lost car manufacturers
The UK will "repent forever" if, after Brexit, it loses the status of the world's leader in car production, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnstone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting at the border in the Brexit case without agreement could cause loss of jobs.
The Burnaston α engine produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis für last year produced almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my point that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement, we will experience production delays in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnstone.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without an agreement over possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer concerns the risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line operates according to the principle of 'timely', where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars operating by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be an interruption at the border that industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota at its factory in Derbyshire couldn't hold more supplies than the ones needed for one day, they said from that company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan, which offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU, is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible deal that will enable, as I say, not only the maintenance of the current success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 programme today said.
"The evidence not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers shows that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful set of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked 24 years in Burnstone and who is a member of the Union union, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, after these jobs are gone, they never return."
The government spokesman says, "We have made a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could "depend for another week" as the fight against Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Attorney Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, ties between Trump's associates and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire a deputy state attorney, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been spreading gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing carrying wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused these statements.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of a announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which further delayed much of the Senate vote.
Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders showed up on Fox News Sunday.
Asking questions about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be delayed for another week considering everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Head Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conference was not a consequence of the "theatrical behaviour" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not oppose the fact that they are being mixed up."
Then she suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organises several meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have analyzed the figures."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make it possible often, and you could have seen it in the last few weeks, and just so you can talk to the President of the United States will replace the short talk to the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, at times, a bizarro performance in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed by National Health Services (NHS) in Scotland because of the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the EU staff employed by the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter not full for six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed to subsisting the cost of submitting residence status requirements for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal, which are moving according to the expected decisions of this autumn, have continued.
But the United Kingdom government is also stepping up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So now I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to an emergency operation after head injury
Linen player Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's defeat from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club with a score of 31 é 27, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on the stretcher and sent it to further search.
A representative of Tennessee State State State State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no "class/obsessed injury details" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third year student with two years of playing field, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five shoot-offs before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 break-downs in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to the new conservative plans, foreign customers will be charged a higher tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralise Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in duties will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Risnica expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged higher tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, while additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters to promises to provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high salaries.
The increase in the fee will be charged by individuals and non-tax companies in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to combat unemployment.
An additional fee ` which is collected in the current fee, including an increase that was introduced two years ago to other homes and real estate purchased for issue ` may be up to three percent.
Risnica expects 120 million pounds a year to be collected by this move.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are bought by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for customers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country have become "spirit cities" especially in the capital because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time out of the country.
A new policy followed only weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by taking but not taking advantage of the country, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on priced properties in order to repair "the shame of the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbin announced proposing a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the end of nothing caused by evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that every new generation should have a better life.
And that means fixing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build life.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies created abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable British.
The dream of having a home has become too far for many people, and the shame of homelessness remains quite real."
Jack Ross: "It's my ultimate ambition to manage Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "end ambition" is one day becoming the governor of Scotland.
Scottish (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after last season again leading St. Mirren at the Scottish football championship.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could only happen if I were successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors at the site of Warden Sunderland include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cani.
Former head of Allo Athletica says he didn't feel fear because he inherited such famous names at such a large club, after he had previously rejected calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this point will be measured according to whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross is only three years old in his management career, after which he was an assistant chief in Dumberton and 15 months' experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from dropping out in the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fallout to the winner of the title of next season's champion.
And Ross says he's now feeling more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real intersection," Alloa recalled.
"I really believed that managing is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I've been doing well, making solid money, and enjoying a pretty successful time.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for pint is at 5:30 on Saturday, according to research
The summer heat wave increased revenues by British pubs who were struggling with finances, but increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
Data show that pubs and bars have achieved an increase in revenues in July by 2.7 per cent, but restaurant revenues have been reduced by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the Business Advisory of the Office of the Central Business Book Controller, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the fine weather and the participation of England at the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub incomes grew by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being even more affected.
A 1.8 per cent drop in restaurant revenues in June just deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly used have won much more under equal conditions than the losses suffered by restaurants.
The pubs where food is mostly served also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed brewery and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales dropped by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for rest and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we see from the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the greatest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight difficulties, although the decline in sales of 4.8% annually will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for local food leaders, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide the necessary rest."
The total growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in share of brands.
The system for monitoring sales in the Caffer Peach Tracker industry for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collected and analysed data on the effectiveness of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value was established.
One of five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
Study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Inst" pages
News has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that shows parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, opens secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts ◆ references to the website for photo sharing.
News has increased fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a cleared "main" account to show parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who encouraged other words of "serve me".
The survey, conducted by the DigitalAwareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a voice of athletics" on the Scottish athletic board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as an executive director at the annual body of directors.
Doyle is the most excellent Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beatie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run sports to take advantage of her wide experience gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the board," Beatie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won a 200-400-metre race in Atlanta in 1996, of his total four Olympic gold, and now a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischemic attack, could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today to exercise agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Shared opinions on the Internet about a traitor's commercial comparing mothers to cows
The company for the production of traitors with its commercials, which the mothers who breastfeed their children, compares with the cows that the husband has triggered, has shared views on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be "the world's first quiet bearer", Elvie's consumer technology company published an ad inspired by ironic music videos to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music, whose text reads, "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tail," and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't ubiquitous, these are my breasts."
Then the refrent follows: "Pulse, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, milk your ladies."
However, the commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it sheds light on the "dangerous" dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that their children steal from them a few days after birth," one person wrote.

Another person comments: “Debtively traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise traitors for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A totally lame commercial."
Others were defending the commercial, while one woman admitted that her song was "freaky".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still nursing, I'd buy one.
Making me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun commercial aimed at mothers who issue milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with discreet traitors located in bras.
The concept of campaigning is based on the knowledge that many women who issue milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's traitor, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes and discreetly fits into the breast bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother Agency, commented: “The traitor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to put the focus of attention to betraying and all his challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the amazing sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time a traitor named Elvie made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to accommodate children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to endanger their own possibility of staying in the country by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsoring minors without an escort.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been reported in criminal records.
"It is almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the country's household sponsors who are illegal, and many of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to shelter workers, with the aim of implementing the child process faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was a standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not personally, to present their case before the immigration court for obtaining legal status.
Those who do not meet the aid criteria will be quickly deported.
According to workers in the shelter and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
The advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that the signs of the child being tortured will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the exception of the fight against terrorism, and would "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," the assembly said.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" by terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are mostly training and counseling both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-broken country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "extending irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebel resistance, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a mass attack by Syrian forces with Russia's support for the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including the Nusra front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "which will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistur hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee drawn up by members of the government and opposition to form a postwar constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump should win again in 2020 unless, what many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, recall and scandal to end his presidency too soon.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic final of the presidency ever!"
There are no signs of visual fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, ratings in the impact period have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the strike period, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" show exceeded ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the evenings of the broadcast of the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer producer of ABC's drama "Designated Survival", the secretary of the government who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on the abortion of the protecologist from the Roe vs Wade procedure, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, you exceed the level of the informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep backgrounds" for his book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's jacket worth $15,000 (the clothing subject of malice), writes Washington Post, and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, the anatomies of Mr. Trump given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he makes you feel like a reality show is that something feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "The pawnshop", about the rotating acting set and the everyday complications of Trump show (the fight with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because you're going to be behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleis this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the television, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung about the end.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money on the outside lies in the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reconstruction of congress districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently restructured county of the Pittsburgh suburban region highlights Democratic Conor Lamb gnome who won a post in the second district in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were again drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally hidden in favour of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a fight to finance the campaign between major party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for a democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the broad-tracked special March elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress district.
That position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political analysts gave a minor advantage to the Democrats.
The United States needs to punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraw.
diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little resistance to Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varrell of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out a management team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials have decided to call on the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore", said spokesman Heather Nauert.
However, fines were considered only against El Salvador, who received estimated $140m of US aid in 2017 for, inter alia, drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, which include reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue on a similar gathering last year, which was seen as an improvement in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus interrupted any examination of the penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or fines from Washington.
On behalf of Mr. Bolton, the White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports confirmed an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following could be a report by special investigator Robert Mueller about the possible Trumpo obstruction of the judiciary, which now has very significant public evidence available.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our election.
If most of them change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to step in front of the voters again, and perhaps eventually to the jury of the flats.
There are many quiet "if" and I do not wish to suggest that Mr. Trum's imminent fall - is neither like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only to face the West and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such dots of inflection, and the unforgivable march of democracy is speeding up or late.
Americans now face several of these points of inflection.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the deputy state attorney, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this paper reported that last year he secretly suggested shooting the president and guessing his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair?" or if it has been confirmed for the Supreme Court in spite of convincing accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, shall we vote in the mid-term elections for the Congress that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're gonna fall for a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with a hooky cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid in Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive remium in Spain against Villarrell early this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify from the G European League.
The knee injury has prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in a season to a 2- with Villarreal, but believes that the Rangers can use that result as a bounceboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled the point.
Maybe we could have stolen the game in the end, but in general, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better at the second.
Thursday's another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive score.
Last year was definitely difficult, between everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
Boys are good and boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the fear of retirement
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear idea of what kind of concern they wanted, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the study subjects in Nationwide said they had talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nacionwide's life insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to take care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your consultant may also help you to come up with a way of paying these costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-sufficientness while you have money.
Take care of your legal documents: In root prevent legal battles.
Enlist healthcare professionals to determine a reliable person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving the power to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not able to.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is finding a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you mind answering questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just finances, it's also who are doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan by your hand."
A man shot multiple times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a gun shot returning home after a night out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The cops described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials said, and an increase in deaths is expected.
Since communications have been cut off, relief officers could not obtain any information from the province of Donggale, areas north of Palua that are closer to the quake epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It is a Donggala district that stretches along more than 300 km of coast on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, the administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal regions of Donggala.
The mines of nickel are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morocco, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Palu and Donggal have been affected by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit West Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatre in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The quake of 7.5 degrees hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatre, causing tsunamis up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck the region of Pedia Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018.: Large earthquakes hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 people killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicions of domestic violence, obstruction of the application of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by state police officer Alaska.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and retains an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where the plea question was "innocent, of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A violations, which means he could be in jail for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a B-class offence, which is fined one day in prison and a 2000-dollar fine.
It's not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of the application of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised the 2016 veteran groups after connecting her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and Indonesian earthquake: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after Friday's earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The quake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power grids and communications have been cut off, and the number of deaths is expected in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the immediate proximity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social networks, they're circling videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palou when the tsunamis hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death sentence for a New York terrorist suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Sayful Saipoov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that hasn't been committed in the state since 1953.
Saip, 30, reportedly used a truck to rent a shop Home Depot to launch an attack on a cycling trail along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, where he cut off pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused severe bodily injury, according to a notification of the intent to seek the death penalty, which was suffered in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to potential death sentences, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury named Saipov struck a 22-point indictment involving eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saip carried him out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibulavivac Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchia, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnac," according to a statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since the southern district of New York last prosecuted the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was the last in a federal case in New York, 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 on an electric chair.
According to court papers, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed lack of remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saip told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to launch an attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty at 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipoov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence, not accepting the admission of guilt for living in prison without the possibility of letting go, will only extend the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense team previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A conservative member of parliament says NIGEL Farage should be in charge of the Brexit talks
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilize the People's Army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former head of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics since one of the members of Parliament Theresa May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Preservative agent Peter Bonne said that the United Kingdom would "out" by now, that Mr. Farage was a secretary to Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in the reconciliation of her deep-divided ranks accentuate the Toriians as a result of a remnant that joins a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers" in the midst of the Brexit supporters' attack, the remains and the EU's supporters.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction of the Eurosceptics and the laborers to choose between its packages and "caos".
Mr. Bonne said at a campaign "Leave Means Leave" in Solhiul that he wants "to throw away the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have received the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added, "I will fight for Brexit, but we must throw out the Chequers."
Voicing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to pass our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bonne rejected allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British had changed their minds and that they wanted to remain completely incorrect."
The conservative and supporters of Brexit and Andrea Yankees were also in the process, addressing journalists with the words: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out to the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message to Mrs May, she added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are about to fail a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us people and our political classes," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'it won't pass'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of the issue of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We're mobilizing the nation's army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we're not going to calm down until we become independent, self-rule, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
The crowd of activists waved at the banners "Torijecs vs Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for security problems he suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada Plus" plan, for the unfettered state at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "really consider running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke of its future on Saturday at direct association with citizens in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the Massachusetts 2016 Trump campaign.
It's been at the center of speculation for some time now, so it could stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman at the head."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with the death outcome of a basketball player at the University of Louisiana (LSU) of Wayde Sims who took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information on the arrest of Dytheon Simpson (20) at 11 a.m., at a press conference for ET.
On Friday, they released the footage of the murder, asking for help in identifying the man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the University of Southern campus.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, on 247ports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of a murder and possession of a weapon and that he killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to custody at East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year high 198 cm student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 matches last season and average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion's title after order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order "will play a major role in the race".
From his initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and inviting Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Wettle first went into boxing and left Hamilton to get into the market at the beginning, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after an action wheel on a wheel that made Ferrari's driver reluctant to leave free interiors in danger of lag behind after a double move in defense of the third curve.
Max Verstoppen started out of the back row and was seven by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race while trusting his tires to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimmy Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived at boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day since Walters spent the whole weekend doing a fantastic job and he's a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team has done a truly remarkable job to achieve a formal finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's meeting over her insistence that she did not release a letter to the public by Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate's judicial board, but commented that what was happening in the Senate has shown that people are "bad and mean and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, ugly and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at publishing and leaking information to the public, and then they say, ‘ Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public - 'aa, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by copying the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent in July a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which leaked earlier in September -- but Feinstein denied that the information had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story in public," Feinstein said to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her secret, which she asked for."
However, its denial did not come to the approval of the president, who, at Saturday night's meeting, commented: "Let me tell you something -- it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence of candidates for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that they use those charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power at all costs.
You see evil, shit, they don't care who gets hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," the words are the president, mediates.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 · 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars redeemed themselves for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday's victory in Dundee on Saturday with a score of five.
In the early minutes, the Giants came to the advantage of two strokes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawnie brought home an equalization, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard evend for Dundee before two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen ensured victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's team, who came out of the background and beat Dundee with a score of 2 ? 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season of two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game arrived in the fourth minute, at 3:35 sharp, as part of Kendal McFaull, with the assistance of David Rutherford to double the leadership by hitting Beauvilier four minutes later.
In the early opening of the game, Sullivan returned the home team to play at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cawnie's equality at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants ended the first third with leadership when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The locals regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalize the force at 27:37.
Cawnie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen for the first run of Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of the victory when his team was already halfway to victory in the final third of the game.
Giants, who lost four of the last five games, host the Milton Keynes teams in the next match Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board avoid earthquakes
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was named a hero after he died while ensuring a safe take-off with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
But despite his colleagues' escape to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower of the Mutiara airport Sis Al-Jufri who was rocking hard.
He stayed to ensure the safe takeover of Batik Air on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He passed away later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from the Balikpan in Kalimantana to be transferred to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart is breaking because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of people killed could reach thousands of people, and the state's disaster relief agency says that access to the cities of Donggali, Sigia and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is believed to continue to increase, as many bodies are still under ruins, and many could not even come," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency spokesman.
Waves reaching a height and up to six metres have destroyed the Pala in which a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “The ambulances are being transported every minute.
The government lacks clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and said to the country's army: "Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia hit earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man is being led as missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that owns an aircraft that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Minnesota now claims that one man is being led as a missing person, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members are safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon, I cannot trace one of the passengers.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person concerned.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday, and that everyone is in stable condition.
Which caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some fathers thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"It's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to break through the water that went down to their waist to the exit in case of a sinking plane threat.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and shouting, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the port repairs also helped rescue using a blowboat to transport people to land before the plane went down in about 30 metres of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the accidents of aircraft carriers registered in PNG, 111 people died in the last two decades, but none of them were involved in Air Niugini.
Analyst exhibits a time review of the night in which the woman is burned alive
The prosecution ended the case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Justice Department, witnessed for hours as a witch in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone records to put together a puzzle on the move of 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was obtained from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, reported by The Clarence Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lain because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, erased her messages, calls and contact details from her phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the closing word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's a refreshed hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude towards the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The singing group "The High Breed" from Bristol argues that hip-hop music has distanced itself from its beginnings filled with political messages and by referring to social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are reborn in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues a couple for firing after "rasist" message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory cancellation after she received a misdirected message from her mother calling her "another black girl".
The couple deny being racist, comparing the charge to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed discontent when she found out that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black after her arrival on the first day of 2016.
"Noee another black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a note to her husband.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she was twice sent to Mrs. Maurice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "dangerous" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, as she claims, because their former nanny, who was an African-American woman, had been doing her job badly, and that she was expecting Filipino instead, to be transferred to New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and asking $350 a day for six months for which she was originally hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racists, saying that the completion of Maurice's employment was reasonable to do, because of the fear that she would be unable to believe because of an insult afterwards.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco for Post.
"But would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of a child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You will sue someone who is in such a situation
"It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, revealed in a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time.
It's very fun what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before a small stuffed bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was denied, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book issue was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was silently proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and was not a boaster," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it all felt like some achievement of his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was watching that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he always credited the credit only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"Hope regularly called to say that it is really bad and that they believe it will not get away," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she will die in the next two minutes and that I must say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medication the doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly lost its effect and abandoned her body system.
She died just before boarding and then it all went out.
I just had to sit there and wait until I knew what was gonna happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside me."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was already in mourning for losing her daughter, boarded a plane along with the other passengers -- who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong feeling of sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages of women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and at age 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with a contagious smile waiting for a bright career.
"They all remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
Before he died, however, he left his job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found a brother after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with an idea with cards "to make people know there's someone you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner, who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas, he was at the bottom of it, when the children opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eyes, he didn't want anything else."
She said his death was a major trauma, but they had to overcome it: “All this leaves a large cavity in the family.
It's tearing us off.
But we'll move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs over until the FBI starts investigating
"I thought we might be able to enter a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he asked for a time and scope limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee "was falling apart" in the middle of a rooted party blockade.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their inadequacy was triggered by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections only arrive in five weeks, November 6th if Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly invites senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI draws up his report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a decisive vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of defects from North Korea 'fall' led by Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Citing the U.S. ministry's data, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1127 defects compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that key factors are stricter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more fees that smugglers charge to people.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment.
The vast majority of northern refugees eventually received South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees illegal, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South are still technical in the war, which have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalearisation talks.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when in a broader sense they agreed to work to liberate the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions that had not made any progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it is not necessary that under such circumstances we first disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric", says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court
The leader of the opposition Nancy Pelosi called the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that because of his temperament he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if I ever acted that way, they would call it 'histern'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate judicial board Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and suffocating as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, calling charges against him "grothestic and co-ordinated demarcation" organised by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed that he had prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Asked whether he would try to call off Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats get most of it in the House of Representatives, Pelos has insisted.
"I will say the following if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is unable not only to be in the Supreme Court, but in the court he is in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democratic woman, she is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Act of Access to Care or the law on the abortion of the prostitute in the Roe v Wade procedure, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh went beyond asking whether he would reshape any Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Probable criticism, anger that has been gathering for months and years, can't be rid of all that without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be executive director and who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said: ‘ You might think I’m sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in the office where men dominated me, is that, at one time when I cried for unspeakable anger, an elderly woman, a cold manager who I was always a little afraid of, dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they think you've been hit."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-made decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"In the race there were already seven candidates and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had already taken place, it was lagging behind with fundraising, and she denied that she would not enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was saying that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of the people who supported her, by the frustration of a system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and by the anger of sexism, to shake her throat.
"You would have thought that I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to the media reminded her.
"You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what he would put on my gravestone.
"She cried."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The start of a trade war between the US and China has echoed out loud and, while the battle is far from over, separation between countries can be of use to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation in this week has emerged with new customs that have affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion), in fact taxing half of all the goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has returned in a way every time, and a recent customs of between five and ten percent to $60 billion of American goods has been introduced.
China has promised that the U.S. will take a hit, and the second largest global economy will certainly not surrender soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by giving in to demands, but public obedience to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays his cards well, US trade war pressures can provide positive support to China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions to launch economic crashes in both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate for strategic thinking that focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" to return refugees, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed by a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the field is more stable and safer thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be welcome to help restore the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 ?5 on the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
So far, the United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown while a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during almost the entire tournament, sent a ball into the water at the first punch, leaving Francesco Molinari to fight.
Italian golfer Molinari shaved in all rounds and became one of four players who had ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament started this format.
The American Jordan Spieth kicked Thorbjorn Olesen out of Denmark, the lowest-ranked European team player, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Potter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most victory in the tournament with 25.5 points in career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop tears.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the Cup again.
It's all up to the team. I'm happy I could help," Garcia said, full of emotion after European victory.
He transmits a torch to his countryman John Ram, who won the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods on Sunday with a score of 2 & 1st.
"I can't be proud of the victory over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
The unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, are just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we supported Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get through it, I'm gonna work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Board, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to people.
