Members of the Village Assembly care that they are "like Muppets"
Some members of the assembly are threatened by the proposal to call themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, such as the Slovenian Parliament).
This came about because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Valizan Parliament.
Members of the assembly in the entire political spectrum are concerned about smiling.
A member of the Labour Assembly said that they were concerned in their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in the Valianian twp means stupid and pwp poop.
A member of the Paid Cymru meeting said that their group as a whole "not satisfied", and suggested other options.
A Valiani conservative said that his group of "open spirits" was about a change of name, while noting that there was a slight difference between the words MWP and Muppet in the pronunciation.
In this context, the expression “w” is similar to that of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire Order.
The Commission, which is currently drawing up draft legislation to present changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any descriptors for members of the assembly will of course have to be taken by themselves."
By law, the Valizan Assembly of Wales Act 2017 authorised it to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valizan Parliament.
As members of the Assembly, the Commission has chosen the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP”, but in public consultation, the majority of support was given the option of “MWP”.
The members of the assembly obviously propose other options, but reaching agreement will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who must submit draft amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the incompatibility of the performance of members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their designation.
Macedonians decide to change state name by referendum
The voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
With the vote, they want to resolve decades of long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name represent the right to their territory and repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on a change of name, said he would not follow the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is just the price they must pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin’s Church were silenced because the Church of Harlem faced difficulties
“The older people I talked to say that sometimes there were bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently today.
Bars are no longer a living room neighborhood where people regularly go."
In churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be back at the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common government (condominium), where people would live who would not help the captives in the neighborhood that remained.
"The vast majority of people who will buy condoms in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that is why the day will come when all these churches close down, as it is unlikely that people who will move to these condoms will become members of these churches."
Both churches built the Belgian religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The original white methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black religious community, which carried out worship nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who is on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who refused to hire or support the dark poles.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building, but when the parishioners planned to rebuild Johnson, they ordered nagging bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “bells for poor people”.
In July, the expert named them a little different: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng expert from Michigan University also stressed that these were the first nagging bells played by a darkpolt musician, Dionysio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he ran to bigger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's Church.
The church of St. Martin’s has a complicated story with architects and contractors over the past few months; some have brought church laiki and others a bishop.
In July, she wrote to the bishops to worry that the bishop would “try to pass the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old while catching lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday, California, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old during lobster hunting at the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego about half an hour ago that he was diving with his friends on Saturday mornings when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then he swam with a group to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just thrilled to catch the lobster and then found out he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had the whole key torn apart.
“I cried out everyone to go out of the water: “In the water is a shark!” he added.
The boy was transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remained in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
In a press statement, the water rescue officer, Captain Larry Giles, said that several weeks earlier the shark was observed in this area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of the hull.
They have been responsible for 48 hours for preventing access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to the Swami beach’s in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Booths, Superothers and Debenhams with beautiful catlikes as they have in wholesale shops and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while the clothing sales and household appliances are dropping, more beautiful corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country and next year in several stores if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beautiful products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used before for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s they say that they will double the offer of their beautiful products on 3,000 products and for the first time include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space in areas with brands similar to those in shops such as Booths.
Supermarket also revives its stupid offer of cosmetic products, so most of the products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume store will test the concession in two shops in Sainsbury’s. The first one opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second one will open in Sally Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and the daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to work harder to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury’s, said retail trade will be similar to wholesale shops, as the supermarket chain tries to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount with multiple services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s group opened Argos outlets in several hundred shops and also Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and the acquisitions were more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s has undertaken a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the alliance ended after a dispute over the division of drug profits in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago for GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores owned by Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds has announced that he will play his part in this plan, as in four stores he is expected to extend the offer of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy marks.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs, attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination, which presents a challenge for the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones "frightful" because Holly Willoughby got out of a job worth £11 million.
The star broadcasts Dragons Den (Good Business) furiously because television director Holly Willoughby withdrew from work worth £11 million with his life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and accessories, Truly.
The company was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The director of this Morning show, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby pissed off the star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones' show, as at the last minute she withdrew from their profitable business with a life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “exciting” when the golden girl of television Tuesday during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his company in Marlon, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to her new business — worth up to £ 1.5 million — there is no longer enough time to dedicate their trademarks to the clothes and accessories of Truly.
The company compared the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and announced that it would double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Trouly was far the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long-term future to survive for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw has completely overshadowed everyone involved.
Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlow, the warehouse is filled with goods prepared for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the head of this Morning, which is among the most interesting banks in Britain, would cost the company millions because of large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
In addition, this can mean the end of long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were a good friend for ten years with Jones and his wife, Taro Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Cappo in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as president in March.
In addition, Jones has a 40 per cent share in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the brand M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show I’m A Celebrity.
The source near Jones last night said, "We will not comment on his business."
Heavy conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about media criticism due to a comment that is considered "non-president" and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in?
Trump, with his mocking "newer" voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He stressed that Kim showed interest in the second meeting, and their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump marked as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see "adequate response" to the previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States continued to impose sanctions on which it continued to pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – they stopped testing missiles, helped free the hostages and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
"It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this crowded scene, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly ahead.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told not to need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka’s population were relocated, they did not declare a natural disaster, a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, they were unfortunately very clear that they did not require international aid, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” said Sumbov.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pal, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Paluje and will see if they will allow international agencies to assist.
Given that the earthquakes in Indonesia are constant, the country remains completely unprepared for nature's rage.
In Aceh, however, they built shelters along the tsunami, but on other shores, this is not common practice.
The loss of life probably contributed to the obvious absence of a warning siren for tsunamis in Paluj, although the warning was in effect.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge at best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok for the victims of the earthquake, is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo set the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit presents a problem for Jok's administration in re-election next year.
Joko also faces the pressure of long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and more than ten thousand were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge set for late equality against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool in 89 minutes before defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League.
Sturridge accepted the Xherdan Shaqiri course 25 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal in the latter of his team 1-0.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the remote doorway.
The arrow traveled high above the crime scene towards the right upper corner of the door.
In the end, the ball went down through Kepa Arrizabalage and fell to the goal.
“I was simply trying to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always drag it as far as I can, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch, I didn't think much anymore and just decided to shoot."
At halftime Chelsea led 1-0 with a hit by Belgian actor Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the wise man gave the fifth ball back to Mate Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
In the middle, the blacksmith quickly went and ran forward.
Then he went through the defense, and Hazard ran into a prison space.
Hazard took over the defense and shot his left leg at a remote doorway through Liverpool's gatekeeper, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will deal with Napoli in the team part of the League of Champions at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, the State Agency reported on Sunday morning.
Representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that there were many people due to a severe earthquake of Grade 7.5, which triggered six-meter waves caught in the ruins of buildings.
The Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police launched a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7:55 in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and was arrested by a 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder.
The police are calling on everyone who's been in the area who's seen or heard a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I call on everyone who was near John Street Street in Birkenhead Street and have seen or heard anything suspicious about getting in touch with us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the camera footage to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the female resident was Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the crime scene who thought they knew a woman and asked where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are informing the female's family.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he found out what happened, he lost his word.
The residents have now been told that it may take several hours before they can enter again.
The police have heard him explain to a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying "this is so terrible."
At 2:00, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one just outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the housing block.
All those who have any information ask to write on @MerPolCC shall call 101 or anonymously contact Creimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 and shall indicate a diary of 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament became the latest memorial target of the "rewrite history" dispute
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy a number of English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society marked Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "the re-write of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today's debate on the removal of statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westministrian palace will become a target.”
The Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell did not even order or implement.
Perhaps for the actions of his predecessor from the last century, he will be sacrificed the wrong Cromwell.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a witness of the 19th century opinion and is part of a history of personality, which some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is numerous (maybe even more in the late 19th century than today) as the protector of parliament before external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
Whether it's a completely accurate play, it's the subject of constant historical debate.
Clearly, the conflict in the mid - 17th century has formed a further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from when Lord was a protector also deserve celebration and memory."
Murdered pigs killed a Chinese farmer to death
After the local media reported on the market in the southwest of China, the pig attacked and killed a farmer.
The man identified only by the name “Yuan” was found dead with a cut artery and covered with blood near the pigs' market in Liupanshua, Guizhou Province, was reported on Sunday at the South China Morning Post newspaper.
The river of pigs is being prepared for vaccination of pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
Following the report, she and her cousin were due to travel from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning the cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in a pigsty with a bloody piece of shit.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had crushed the farmer to death.
“Brother's legs were bloody and decomposed,” quoted the cousin named “Wu” as saying in the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks have already been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, with a male suffering from severe physical injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig was pushed by a Valianian farmer by a tractor, but then the woman was driven away by an animal.
After eating a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “producer”.
"We'd just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to be shown a sufficient measure of respect," he said.
♪ To the southwest of the United States ♪ ♪ For the rest of the Orcan Rosa ♪ ♪ There's a lot of rain ♪
According to the forecasts, Orcan Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and weak.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
From Sunday of 5.00 a.m. in the east of the 1st category of the wind speed of 137 km/h, Rosa is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the low air pressure area that is moving east to the west coast of the USA is increasing. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push a high tropical moisture to the north to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture that will interfere with the low air pressure area will in the coming days create abundant rainfall in the wider southwest area.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, delaying floods and possibility of land beaches in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will be approaching 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially above the vast majority of Arizona, it is expected to range from 50 to 100 mm of rainfall.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Strong rains can turn canyons into storms, and storms will bring local suns of wind and dust in the air.
The approaching low air pressure area will bring local rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Depletions above 12 mm may be possible, which may result in a lower delay in the flood and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy period.
A few scattered tropical boards will begin approaching Arizona on Saturday afternoon and Monday morning, and late on Monday, and rainfall will expand on Tuesday.
The strong rains will spread on all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, great temperature fluctuations can occur in the US, as Arctic cools down, and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the central United States.
Between Canada City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is 20 degrees apart.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stop and expand again.
Most Central and Eastern US will enter warm October with temperatures of approximately 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York on Tuesday, we could have 27 °C, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the average for the East of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on six television networks have seen the interesting Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexual assault, to whom he was due in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, as television stations interrupted the regular program due to the last minute's online conversion: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI will carry out a single investigation of charges.
Ford's Justice Committee said that she was 100 percent confident Kavanaugh was touching her and trying to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a bad testimony that he is 100 percent confident that this did not happen.
Nielsen reports that Friday’s testimony to the mirror is more than 20,4 million people.
The company considered the average ratings of CBS television networks, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that played the testimony, including PBS networks, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems counting viewers who watch the program in offices.
For an easier performance, ratings are similar to those in the final football game or awarding awards to the American Film Academy.
The Fox News Channel TV, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, leads to all 5.69 million audience networks, reports Nielsen.
In second place, ABC is with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
The profession remained high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanough, TV network cameras CNN and CBS recorded on Friday morning how the protesters were shouting at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
During the construction, he associated his view for a few minutes, which caught CNN's camera camera on the live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," a woman told him.
"You think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power while many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his office made a statement, and added that he would speak more at the hearing of the committee, and then the door of the elevator closed.
All television networks also broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted in favour of the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate vote.
But Flake said that he would only do this if they agreed that next week the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate, which was called upon by the minority party of the Democrats.
Flake was convinced in this part of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's voice was decided because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump launched an investigation into the US Federal Investigation Office (FBI) on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses of "playing political games" at the peach
In an interview with the Sunday Times magazine, Prime Minister Theresa May, criticised her plans for leaving the European Union for "playing political games" with the British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Brenxit plan from Chequers and said that the proposal was that Britain and the EU were paying customs duties to another "mostly absurd".
Shooting at Wayde Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of the death of the LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball team named LSU.
After a police report from Baron Rouge, the 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and the police indicated that during the battle, Sims lost his sunglasses.
Police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS television complemented WAFB television reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police issued a statement that he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
Security is $350,000, lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish district overseer issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are thanking the special task force for the assistance of the investigation leading to the arrest, the special task force for the fugitives of the luisian state police, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the police of the South University and the inhabitants of the area.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "care and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
On average, the previous season collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said that the team was “threwd” and “in shock” because of Wade’s death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcana brüha ash on Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes puked by the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighbourhood of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of disaster warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as the activity in the crater was strengthened and recorded 183 gas and ash releases within 24 hours.
The Center observed several cases of thunder and earthquake suns.
The images on social networks showed thin layers of ash covering windscreens of cars in the neighbourhoods of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have been observed by an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 earthquake shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called “Don Goyo”, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan Separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters supporting independence faced counter-extreme police units and joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarised vote on secession.
A group of masked Separatism supporters, held by anti-aircraft police units, had been polluting them with eggs and metal powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were fights, and police officers had to use the pendrels to stop the clashes.
The supporters of independence, who called for many hours "without forgetting, without forgiveness", faced protesters who supported unity and cried "Let Live Spain!".
As reported by local media, 14 people in the protests received minor injuries.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was marked illegal in Madrid, and the Catalan Separatists celebrated it, and tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although participation was low, as opponents of secessions largely boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in the region in violent conflicts.
The groups supporting independence camped overnight before the vote to prevent demonstrations and thus supported the state police.
Demonstrations continued, but they had to take another route.
A 68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"We experienced one of our best times last year.
I watched my parents cry out of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, although the close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties supporting independence this year have been difficult to maintain the initiative, as many of the most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or are in custody awaiting trial due to their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who taped a protest on the phone in support of the police, explained that the protest had fueled politics on both sides.
“The tension is rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the trial, announced that he will run for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men who ran into the house by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested because they ran into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place at Ballinagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 19:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said the doors were damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they're supposed to fire a crossbow against the car.
With Mengai's hit, Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers.
Dolly Menga with her first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston was amazed by the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had only to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as the coach of the club from Ibrox.
The shooting of Dolly Mengay made a difference, as Gary Holt's team leveled with the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team thus ran out of victory in the guests in this year's championship, and the next week, Hearts, which leads on the scale, are behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston increased his series of undefeated division to six matches and coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston wasted his chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have led quite before the hit, as they caused many problems with their directness to Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he sent the ball across the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the doorway, and Craig Halkett shot him over the goal.
The guests left the game to the Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous to the guests at the time of their interruptions in the attack.
And that's how they got the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson took action for Mengai, who shot and hit the middle of the crime scene.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but domestic defenses couldn't get through, and the doorman Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
The goalkeeper of the Rangers Allan McGregor, with his leg, chose Scott Pittman's shot, and Lithgow, from another Livingstonian break in the attack, shot past the goal.
The proposals continued to come to Livingston's criminal space, but the domestics refused all attacks, two violations — Halket's offence over the exchange of Glenn Middleton and the hand-to-hand offence — but the judge did not judge.
“Excellent performance” Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great show and score for Livingston.
Everyone was great and continued to go beyond the expectations on this path up.
The style of the game and the law did not change much from their return to the top, but Holt should be credited for the way he awakened the team from his arrival.
It was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and has well distributed well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral all the time.
But the Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although the Gerrards are exceptional, they lack these standards.
There was a shortage of goal shots — only once successfully overcome the defense of the hosts — and this is some kind of wake-up for the Rangers who were in the middle of the scale.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, press freedom and Turkish accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to the opening of a giant new mogul.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 heads have prevented the crowd from gathering before the man, but many supporters have been able to get closer to seeing their president.
Its opinion also expressed hundreds of protesters – many Kurds – who do not support Erdogan's government and condemned Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposing protests reflect the separation of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as heroes and others despise as highways.
A road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died in a car race
In London, a cyclist was killed during the race in which the car was involved.
The accident occurred near the intersection between the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a roadway in Deptford in the southeast of the city at approximately 10.15 a.m. at British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the ambulances came, but the man died at the crash site.
The accident occurred only a few months after the cyclist died in a race where the car driver fled, on Childers Street Street, about 1.5 km from a Saturday accident.
Police have issued a statement that police officers are checking the identity of a man so they can inform their owners.
They set up roadblocks and rerouted bus lines, and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six guards injured in an incident
Six prison guards were injured in an incident in a heavily protected male prison, reported from the prison administration.
The mess broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 after British summer time and is still going on.
Police officers from the Tornado unit have been called upon to arrange for an incident involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor facial damage on the spot.
The representative of the prison staff said: “We called in specially trained staff to ensure that the incident in the prison of HMP Long Lartin is taken care of.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and that is why they may be further behind bars."
In the HMP Long Lartin prison, there are over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was reported to be in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called a police counter-infectious unit to intervene in a serious incident in which the staff attacked with pool bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for the dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what will likely happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of Orcan Rosa paves its way through the southwest desert and poses a threat to sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about the sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orcan Rosa is supposed to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he's gonna be late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950 was maintained by only “ten tropical cyclones! ”
The Orcan Katrina (1967) was a good 20 miles [60 km] from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Orcan Centre provide for 50 to 100 mm rainfall with individual rainfalls up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the areas of Rockies and Great Basin, 25 to 50 mm rainfall is expected, individual rainfalls are possible up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of Orcan Rosa may be a blessing, as the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as the dry season is currently going on in the southwest.
“According to the US Sushi Monitoring Centre, the good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought,” reports Weather.com.
The route of Orcana Rosa first leads to the land of the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa, who still has power on Sunday morning at the highest wind speed of 137 kilometers an hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers an hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and thus weakens.
It is expected that the land in Mexico will reach with the power of tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The slopes in the parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great danger of flood.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm rainfall with 250 mm of rainfall” was reported on the Weather.com website.
Orcan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and towards southern Utah until late night on Tuesday.
“The greatest danger we expect from Orcan Rosa or its remains is the heavy rain on the Baja Caliphonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the American southwest desert,” the National Center for the Orcans said.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earth's beaches in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after being found in Somerset by a 16-year-old with stab wounds.
The wounded teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 p.m. after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old was arrested in the Radstock area at night, police from Avon and Somerset reported.
Police are calling on anyone with a cell phone who may have caught what's going on to pick up.
Trump said Kavanaugh "took the unkindness and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthlessness and unheard tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "took the unkindness and anger" of the democratic party in the process of its appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention and clearly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
During the hearing, she also testified to Ford’s accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage".
"The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an extraordinary record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in western Virginia.
Indirectly, the president mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican election participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am really working with the candidacy," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstacles".
The first key parliamentary vote in the Chamber on Kavanaugh's appointment was due to take place on Friday at the latest, the CNS adviser told the Republican Party.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims is rising
On Saturday, authorities reported that at least 384 people died in an earthquake and tsunami that affected Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of them took giant waves to the shore.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo, when six-foot waves hit the coast at night and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami was at risk yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they became victims,” said the representative of the Indonesian agency for the relief of accidents BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, he knocked everything down," Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centres in Paluje.
The photos of the air published by the disaster agency indicate the destroyed buildings and shops, bent and destroyed bridges and moshes surrounded by water.
The earthquake suns continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, there was a range of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPT) said that the energy released in the online strong earthquake is approximately 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The gravity of the city lying at the end of the long and narrow bay is to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and added 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that victims and damage may be more along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggala area near the quake epicenter.
As Nugroho further said, communications are completely interrupted and have no information from the Donggala area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross statement said, adding that staff and volunteers are heading to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunami had hurt Pala, but officials say the waves came right at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage, published on social networks, shows how a man on the top floor screams warns people on the street on nearby tsunamis.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran down the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
With Reuters, they could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquakes and tsunamis have caused the power to fall, which has cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic living supplies.
The airport was opened only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Paluje on Sunday.
The number of victims in Indonesian tsunami has increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Cases, members of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived safely in Pal, where employees in the courtyard set shelter from the ponies before their premises, but on the way saw numerous scenes of desolation.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with many experience would not allow their arrival in Pal.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, overseas funding, stocks and staff assistance are permitted only if the site of the accident is declared a national accident area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still considered an accident at the level of the province," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet."
The second night after an earthquake and a tsunami in Palujah, friends and relatives of missing people are enthralled by the hope that their near wonders are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled the boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who was trapped under the ruins for two days, along with the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian team of sailing parachutes, trained two missing sailing divers for the Asian Games, which ended in early this month in Indonesia.
Others caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As the age of sailing falls, I bear my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was circulated by a community of divers, he was in despair sending messages to the application of whatsApp to competitors in Paluje, who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole the 26.750 USD while filling the ATM at Newport on the Levee
After reporting from the Newport police, the thieves stole a 26.750 USD security worker from Brink’s, who filled a ATM in Newport on the Leeve center on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing for the delivery of money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
During his employment, another man “took close to the security service of Brink”s from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not state the exact number of participants involved in the event.
All those with information on suspects' identities are to call the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – to Ye.
The change was reported on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “The being with the official name Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has a nickname Ye for a while and has also used it to title his eighth album, which he published in June.
The change comes just before his performance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is scheduled to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who cancelled the performance for "personal reasons", said the creator of the show.
The word is a shortening of his current professional name, but West has already said that his word has religious meaning.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning “you” (you)” said West at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the title of the album to the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you and I am all of me.
Kanye, which means "the only one", I turned into Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his wish for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without thought and with capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn never to use military forces against civilians, just as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movements began to operate in Latin America, 300 people began shooting and killing on peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans and students with monthly subsidies and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal societies.
The U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funds used for research in this area, a true investor and expert on artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after the various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in innovations in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are much for the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would happen in the US, Lee told CNN in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Supersiles of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order) published this month by Houdon Mifflin Harcourt, the president of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American player Othelo, and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous American government technology competitions, such as the robot competition organised by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when the next one would be easier to find the following visionaries.
Researchers in the US must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
"It is not China that takes over the best academics, but it is companies," Lee explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked best from universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to the immigration policy could help the US strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer a green card to people with a doctorate from artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
The National Foundation for Natural Science is funded by people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, to the American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrow board of artificial intelligence.
This month, however, DARPA announced investment in the AI Next initiative of USD 2 billion.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests over 100 million USD per year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, American legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians to decide on country name change at referendum
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This would resolve decades of debt dispute with Greece, which opposed their requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour's name represents the right to their territory and has invested a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has expressed doubts that participation will be at least 50-seat, as long as it is necessary for the referendum to be in force.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for the accession of bodies such as the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries created after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be free to live under the auspices of the European Union because this means safer lives for all of us," Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje, said.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote that will be decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has reported that no irregularities have been reported until 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our city is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevsky, 62, a constituent from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, submitted their ballots for a referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on a change in the name of a country that would open the way to NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join us with our heads raised, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurosian integration."
The Prime Minister, Zaev, says that membership in NATO will bring a strongly needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that there will be a large majority for because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his ballot was submitted.
He added that the positive result would be “confirmation of our future”.
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday showed that the referendum would take place between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma television showed that 57 per cent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote for.
To succeed, the referendum must be a 50 per cent vote.
An unsuccessful referendum would mean the first more serious blow to the pro-Western government policy, which took office last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City played the whole of Brighton's defense and hit
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at the Manchester City Stadium in Manchester, Manchester, England.
Aguier's hit at 65 minutes looked ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentinan attacker accepted a floor in the middle of the playground.
He ran between three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green players.
He played one of the defense players and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's crime scene.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
The English attacker returned the Aguer ball with his first touch in the criminal space, which beat Brighton's porter Matthew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is facing problems in his legs," he told reporters, coach of City Pep Guardiol.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the goal at that time."
But Sterling was the one who gave blue blues an initial advantage in the first English league's duel.
The goal was reached in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane nicely on the left.
The dream touched the balls several times, and then sent the ball to Sterling to the remote doorway.
The blue man's attacker pushed the ball into the net just before she flew past the goalpost.
On Tuesday, at 12.55 p.m., the city will meet with Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Synsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies and spoil their title options
The Nationals team fell out of the finish line, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the finals, as in the West League they have the advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
On Friday, Rockies won 5:2 over the Nationals team provided a minimum invitation to the organizer, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
“Although there is nothing we can gain, at least we will be able to play in a great atmosphere before a great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals haven't published the first metal name for Sunday, but it's likely to be metal Scherzer in this case.
On Thursday, Scherzer, which will be the first metal for 34th time, is the metal as a drowsy player and would have had enough days of rest until Sunday.
The Washington right-handler has collected 18 wins and 7 losses with an average allowable course of 2.53 and 300 discharges with impact in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
Indirectly, the president touched the situation regarding his choice for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican election participation in the mid-term elections.
"All we have done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I am really working with the candidacy, so I fight everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and this is happening now.
They are determined to retake power, using all possible means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
In his words, the Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstacles".
“And you can see it in the last four days,” he said and marked the Democrats as “frightful, wicked, low and false”.
Namely, he highlighted a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and a loud disapproval was heard from the audience.
“Do you remember her response?
Have you published the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. This was really the bad talk of the body, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When an activist of the Momentum organization told me in my local client, it wasn't even a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a row of members of parliament from a Labour Party that we are not eager to express our opinion.
My colleague, Commissioner Joan Ryan, happened similar because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, there was a motion of non-confidentiality for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the Labour Party Nottingham East said that "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In eight years, as far as I am a member of parliament's local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, most meetings do not use such tones and promises of a "friendly and gentler" policy have long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly obvious that the various views in the Labour Party are not permitted and that in each opinion it is assessed whether this is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, who I had previously thought we were sharing similar political views, expected me to change my mind and take views that I would never agree with — should this be in the field of national security or the single EU market.
When I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — they follow criticism on social networks that call for non-election, condemn the policy of the middle and tell me that they should not be in the laborist party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I'm meant to be are political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet the flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but do not let themselves be afraid.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become quite common.
Jeremy Corbin explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with each proposal of non-confidential or amendment of the rules for selecting the client becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice to put my head down and not be so loud, and everything will be fine with me.
But I didn't go into politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student — the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher Government, which led to my primary school literally falling down — I have tried as a local councilor or government minister for better public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my political views and areas that I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is swimming against the peach that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and the electorate, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threats to the election or political suit will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament from Nottingham East's party
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unmoved Ayr on top of the scale
Two known attempts have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned a victory in this wonderfully fun primary day match.
Now they're on top of the scale, and they're the only undefeated team in the tens.
In the end, the scale on the home side was promoted by their top defense and better exploiting the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason to be pleased.
"In our previous games, we have passed many tests and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Congratulations to the Ayra team, opportunities have been used better than we have."
Grant Anderson's score in 14 minutes, which was converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received him in the game with Warriors, was a numerical leverage for Melrose and Jason Baggott intercepted an attempt without conversion.
Climo increased the leadership for Ayr at the time of the halftime and then converted a stand-alone attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at the time of the break.
But Melrose had a very good start with the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggett down to five points.
It followed a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruardh Knott, which they took to the stretchers, and followingwards Ayr progressed with the attempt by Stafford McDowal, which was converted by Climo.
The temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPhersp then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the game with the player more with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing the Clim without a ball, MacPherson hit the hit.
Climo reached the point after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent a wing player, Gregor Henry, in the fifth attempt at hosts.
Star of Still Game series begins a new career in catering
The Star Star of Still Game Ford Kieran is obviously being given in hospitality, at least to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a long-standing partner in comedy Greg Hemphill.
Two announced that after the next ninth season, Kiernan already seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, Adriftmorn Limited is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but the source suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "blowing hospitality" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, marine blue flags are debossed.
Marine bases from Lake Titika to Amazon are covered with slogan: »We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
In continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as long as they yearn for a new floating on the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be received after five years of consultations on 1 October.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit, expects results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the international court's decision on big screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will decide for Bolivia, which claims that, after decades of unstable talks, Chile will negotiate access to sovereign access to the sea.
Here's Morales, the Bolivian charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has great expectations about Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia — and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to assign Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case “was not complicated”” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken in favor of Bolivia, but they might cost it a lot.
"The current Bolivian government has used the question of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has absorbed all the good that might remain from the Chileans, which she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to participate in discussions afterwards.
The states haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court was unusually quick to make a decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — had used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a speech at the UN General Assembly.
The United States called on them to fulfill their promises at a meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when American Minister Mike Pompeo is apparently before the relaunch of nuclear diplomacy at a dead point more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Young Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is wrong to think that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the forecasts of the end of the Korean War of North Korea will be brought to its knees.
Washington is careful to attach the forecast without Pjongjang first taking decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, there is general doubt that Pjongyang is serious about the cancellation of a weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pjongjang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In the fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest line of huge covers that come into the shops with affordable brands in your vicinity
If you want to complete your cover collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look forward.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their spring and summer collections 2019 on the fashion runway a collection of strange overcoats that blinded the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The very impractical covers were flooded by Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular designs to the fashion runway.
Valentine’s piece, which was the most exited, was a beige hat with wide ends decorated with feathers similar to those in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other excessive fashion accessories included watermelons with precious stones, magic hats and even pineapples — but your heads will not warm up.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks — just the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have sewn lips and are more similar to the masks of Hannibal Lecter than the high fashions.
One creation was similar to the equipment for diving with breathing and glasses, and the other one looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashionable acquaintances predict that giant covers will come to the store near you.
The wide hats are closely followed by "La Bombi", a straw hat with 60-centimeter places were observed at Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for an extremely impractical hat that flooded the social networks sent another large creation — a straw bag for the beach, which was almost as large as the model in the swimsuits it wore.
The rapium bag in the burnt orange color, surrounded by the resars of the refinery and the white leather handle, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection of the Jacquemus for spring / spring 2019 on Paris Week.
The famous Luke Armitage Stylist told the FEMAIL: “I expect that large hats and beach bags will arrive in the store for next summer – because the designer has made such a strong impression, the demand for too many accessories would be difficult to ignore.”
John Edward: language knowledge is crucial for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams that are further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council for Single Schools (SCIS) are seeking to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career and the city they hold as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable selection items in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, his conversation is in the memory.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, his words are in his heart."
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results show that languages at the top of the scale are the highest performance rates in independent schools.
68 percent of students studying foreign language achieved an excellent assessment.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Single Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students achieved an excellent assessment in Mandarin and an excellent assessment was given by 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key knowledge that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
The languages are treated as a selection subject in the school's school plans and elsewhere as objects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The survey carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that for the reasons why employers are struggling to fill jobs, 17 percent can be attributed to lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, knowledge of languages is becoming more and more urgent in preparing young people for their future career.
In future employment opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in the global world.
If a person learns another language, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 Youth Survey, which included more than 4,000 adults in the UK, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak foreign language well enough to talk, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of the respondents, which is 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical contemporary languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, a number of languages taught by experts in this field will always be available in independent schools.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will provide children with knowledge that they need for success, regardless of what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, and therefore this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "International Communication Skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
I'll fatten the faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish self-school world
LeBron will debut in Lakers uniform in San Diego on Sunday
For fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first performance as a team of Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon be over.
The Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton explained on the official website of the Lakers team.
The official reporter for the Lakers Mike Trudell team wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers matches before the season.
“In this phase of my career to prepare I don’t need a match before the season,” he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump, today in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins a series of conventions in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled conventions in the next week, including the beginnings in its favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for freedom in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are threatening to lose control of Congress after the November vote.
At what time will Trump's convention in West Virginia and where can he be watched online?
The Trump convention in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 19.00 hours Eastern Time.
Trump convention in West Virginia can be watched live online on YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to be talking about hearings of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week, who became tense about sexual misdemeanor charges, which is why confirmation in the Senate is expected to be postponed for a week for the FBI to carry out an investigation.
But the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, win a new momentum.
This is why President Trump's campaign aimed at promoting volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
"The watch in Congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the difficult campaign season as possible," the representative of Trump's campaign, who does not want to be appointed, told Reuters.
Today's convention at the Wesbanco Arena Centre in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would attract the interest of the pittsburg media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia Patrick Morris, who is lagging behind in public opinion research.
“For Morris, it is a bad sign that the president must come and raise him” in public opinion research,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team still wants to win and maintain hope before Sunday's individual duels
After three one-sided games, perhaps Saturday afternoon's duels were what Ryder's cup needed this afternoon.
The fluctuating shade is a completely imaginary sports concept, but players truly believe it, especially in such competitions.
So where's the flu going now?
"They had six points of advantage and now they have four, so this is probably a new drive for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a priority, because it leads four points and twelve more can get it.
But the Americans, according to Spieth's words, feel that the wind is in the sails, and, among other things, they are encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was destined from the initial blow to the greenery and sets a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and his two points behind were equaled in the fourth game.
The blow that he brought them to the 15th hole, he accompanied with a similar scream, one that lets you know he believes that the American team still has options.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with multiple points like Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
It is unusual, but the charming two Europeans have won four points of four and are infallible.
The two "Malliwood" were the only ones who didn't hit a bug on Saturday afternoon, and the boogies also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy between them and the noisy audience seems to flow is confirmed by the fact that they are those players who will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal the potential victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
If possible, both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergia Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game with Alex Noren.
Because of the noise and the two double buggies in the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish fell into a crisis they couldn't find their way out of.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
The games with four balls and a duel of two twins are the exception of being closely monitored for communication between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better than a team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the duels of the two two have shown that the US team also has a desire to win, some of whom, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe runs 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's Cup with a nice advantage after Saturday's games with four balls and two duels leading from 10:6 to the United States.
The excellent couple, composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, have won four points with two victories over Tiger Woods and at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who sought to win the trophy that she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, had in the morning games with four balls of power over the American team who sinned and led in sequence with 3:1.
The U.S. team better resisted the duels of two of them, where they won two games, but they couldn't make it up to them.
The team of Jim Fury needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual duels if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four consecutive points, while with Molinari (a pair called "Molliwood") after the sensational end of the week, only the second couple who won four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they again proved to be a more convincing victory over the spent Woods and the American novelist Bryson Dechambeau of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 of the 29 games in duels with four balls and two duels, of which seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning games with four balls, returned for the duels of two twins and in pairs with Henry Stanson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, it was not all planned for the team of Europe.
The three-time winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new standard for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they strongly won against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four ball game and later returned and defeated Powerer and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the duels of two two, losing the first two holes.
Just once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team returned after four points behind, even though Fury's team only needs an equalization to maintain the trophy.
But after two days on another site, Sunday’s attack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: "We will not be unilaterally disarmed without confidence"
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that further enforcement of sanctions is causing an increasing lack of confidence in the United States and that under such conditions North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had taken a number of "important measures in favour of goodwill", such as stopping the implementation of nuclear and missile experiments, supporting the city for nuclear experiments and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see an appropriate response from the US," he said.
"We will not be convinced of national security without confidence in the US and under such conditions we will not be unilaterally disarmed."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, under which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual measures, his statement was important because he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim John Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, held on 12 June in Singapore. At that time, Kim committed to "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised security guarantees.
North Korea wants the official closure of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pjongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not waived the invitation to release strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"Now they insist that we must first disarm the nuclear weapon and step up pressures with sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even object to the declaration of the end of the war," Ri reported.
“In the idea that sanctions could get us on our knees, it is the unrealistic hope of people who don’t even know us.
The problem is that further enforcement of sanctions further deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the US President at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Dze In, who had taken place in the past five months, and added: "If the problem of nuclear disarmament had been discussed with South Korea and not the USA, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have agreed to such a dead spot."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different from last year when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after it marked "Mr. Evil President" Trump Kim as "a cancerous man" on a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that he had much work to do and that sanctions had to remain valid until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time frame for this, and stated: "Tria can two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council must continue decisively without exception until we recognise the complete, definitive and verified state of nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously accepted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Rio at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjongyang would visit again next month for preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been well completed.
When he left Pjongjang in July, he declared that there was progress and that North Korea was criticising him for several hours now that his demands were "gangster".
At a meeting with Moon, which took place this month, North Korea committed to break the missile testing station and the nuclear test infrastructure if the United States would take "adequate measures".
Munu was supposed to say that with the "appropriate measures" security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and the measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The aim of this new course at Harvard University is to teach all graduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course they want to fight the growing masculine culture of “all-night” learning, where the powers are collected with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world's best university often do not know the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medical sleep at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, set up a course that according to his first such species in the United States.
In order to carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
After the end of the lecture, the girl approached him and said, “Why do I only find out now that I'm in the last year?”
She said that no one had told her how important the sleep was yet, and for the newspaper The Daily Telegraph, the professor told him that it was surprising.
This year's first course talks about the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sports success as well as for improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of Health Services of the University, says that they decided on such a course when they found that students were significantly short of sleep during the week.
A one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student home door where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports slippers and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep shortages on sports success and the importance of sleeping routines.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of cardiac arrests, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of a student village with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that students’ behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how cigarette smoking affects their health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present at “sustainable night learning”. It also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, represent a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid getting weight – the brain is becoming hungry because of lack of sleep, making students constantly hungry.
19-year-old California chemical and physical biology student Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler set up a course. Last year he attended one of the professor's lectures during his first year at Harvard.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student village.
He hopes that in the next phase he will be able to ask postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competition facility.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a sleep alarm as well as a awakening. He also wishes to warn them about the harmful effects of the “blue light” broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause the imbalance of the circadia rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit sunk up the Gerrard team
Rangers again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston declared team Steven Gerrard condemning defeat by 1 : 0.
The team from Ibrox was hunting for its first guest victory after the February superintendent at St. Johnstone Stadium 4 : 1, but Gary Holt's team has defeated her second in 18 matches since Gerrard's lead team, leaving his team behind 8 points behind.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half, and the chosen race of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to even it up.
With this the Rangers have fallen into a common place, and Livingston has advanced to third place, but with the difference of goals, the Hibernian team has lagged behind.
Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when the subject came in after reporting him from a visiting team fan.
Gerrard took eight shifts in the crew who had no trouble defeating Ayr and taking part in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup Cup Cup Cup Cup Cup Cup Cup.
On the other hand, Holt held on to the double-checked eleven of Livingston, who had taken away the Hearts Point a week before that, and undoubtedly was thrilled with how his team was effectively neutralizing all the guests' attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga first found Scott Pittman, which then went to the goal of Allan McGregor, but he was tied to performing inexplicably and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game was more about hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite certain that after the race with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the game, a criminal shot was imposed, but Judge Steven Thomson had put the Colombian request into potassium.
For the first half, Rangers managed to draw only two shots to the goal, but not a head shot sent against the goal by Lassan Coulibaly, nor the lukewarm ball of Ovie Ejari, were no danger to porter Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everything, but he has already been completely credited for his endurance.
Rangers failed to cash in another Jacobs extension with a long floor.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, which Mengi routinely prepared for a simple conclusion of the attack.
Gerrard acted and replaced Coulibaly during his vacation with a covert actor Ryan Kent, who immediately proved himself to be Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his own line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingston continued in his style and guests in his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more below the goal.
Holt's team could have increased further to the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton at the end of the game was given the possibility of a criminal shooting after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not recognize him.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
We represent a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, which is now more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became world-famous physics.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger counter.
This became a constant in the scientific world, and it was also in the pop culture, for example in the film "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientist:
Men: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: »This is Geiger's counter. Used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect on atoms of radioactivity in materials."
Evans: "Madonca, now they're really talking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention with his name on it lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify the attack cells and destroy them.
In the course of therapy, the vaccine learns the immune system to identify attack cells
This method includes the production of the immune cells of the patient, which are then modified in the laboratory
After this, “see” protein, which is characterised by many forms of cancer, can then be returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that taught the immune system to identify attack cells, cancer on the ovaries disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the production of immune cells of patients who are converted into a laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein that is characterised by many forms of cancer and then re-injection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute of Cancer Research from Bethesda in Maryland said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promots the growth of several different types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon.
A similar approach to the production of immune cells of patients who are taught to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of the type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after performing at SNL, performed a prothrompic point with a MAGA sign on a stroke.
The public wasn't thrilled
Kanye West was drawn up in the studio of Saturday Night Live at a strange point, during which he expressed his support to US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 will push for the presidential chair.
After the end of the performance with the third song of his performance, called "Host Town", including the hat with the inscription "Mike America Great Again", West began with an attack on the Democrats and reiterated its support for Trump.
“It happens often that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump, since he is racist?’
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
This time SNL broadcast began with a parade with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood actor defamed from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission, accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue wasn't played, but it was loaded into social networks by Chris Rock's comedian.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of West.
The West also complained to the public that he had some difficulties in the back of his caps.
“They came after me after the stage.
They told me “don’t go on stage with this cap”.
I've been harassed!
And they say I am lost," he said after reporting from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the lost scene?” and added that it must put on “Superman’s cape because that means that no one can command me. You want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments were prepared by the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL team were in obvious distress, and someone also said about Vanity: “There was death silence in the studio.”
The West was last invited to a goat replacement for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The West has caused many wonders by the video of the song “I Love It”, where he wore the costume bottle of the mineral water brand Perrier.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the conservative TPUS group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for being APRORT RAJI.”
But the head of Karen Hunter's interview show tweeted that West is simply "what it is, and that's all right.
However, I will not reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his “arts”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and disseminates ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and will now be "the being, formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE."
He is not the first musician to decide to change his name, but before him did Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dogg once named himself Snoop Lyon, but we can't forget another musical legend: The Prince turned his name into a symbol, then he was an artist, once known as the Prince.
A man accused of attempted murder for stabbing a person at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after Friday at a restaurant in East Belfast, a man stabbed.
Police say the event happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must report Monday to the court in Belfast.
The charges will be reviewed by the D.A.
The star of the Battle of the Thrones' Games, Kit Harrington, appeared harshly against toxic manhood.
Kit Harrington is known for his astonishment of the sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval painted fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old player who has strongly condemned the stereotype of a masculine hero, says that because of the appearance of such deposits on the screens young boys often feel that respect can only be earned with stubbornness.
Kit told the magazine The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something had gone wrong, and he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the #JTudi movement period.
The player, who recently married a 31-year-old teammate from the Rose Leslie Games, admitted to having strong beliefs on this subject.
"I am personally seriously wondering where we made the mistake of having a man," he said.
“What did we teach men about the problems we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood due to the display of very manlike characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do they teach us on television and on the streets that young boys feel like they have to choose the very side of manhood?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change that?
Because it was obviously wrong for young men."
In his interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in the recording of any foreword or continuation of the Thrones' Games because he "has concluded with battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will play the main role of a new performance by True West Sam Shepherd, a story about a film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that the best thing that happened for the Games of the Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on the video.
"For this series I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose played Ygritte in the fantasy show, awarded to Yon Snow, the love selection of Kit's character.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
In most new cases, the disease has been transmitted by sexual relations, which represents a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, according to data from Chinese health officials from a conference in the province of Junan, the number of people who contracted HIV was reduced to almost nothing.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is still increasing annually by 100,000 people in China.
Transferring HIV through sexual relations is a very pressing problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very present.
As conservative values continue to apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to women.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such situations.
Since 2003, as part of the effort to solve the problem, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that personnel have issued data on Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "due theories"
On Saturday, American Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected charges that a member of her staff published information on three US Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The L.A. Democrats claimed that these accusations came from individuals and websites of the far right.
"The lies, lies and more inadmissible lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The published information by reference includes home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the state of Utah.
These data appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate meeting on sexual harassment charges for Supreme Judge Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators had completed the Kavanaugh hearing.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState suggest that through IP it is possible to identify the source of publication that is supposed to be connected to Senator Waters' office and conclude that the information has been published by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are a completely wrong and pure lie” continues Waters.
"My employees whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations are in no way responsible for the leakage of these data.
These unfounded accusations are a completely unreal and pure lie."
Senator Waters' statement came up quickly online with criticism, including former White House representative Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial of anger”, wrote Fleischer.
“This can mean that it is not the right test for congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, they can't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he can't doubt the motive of the one he accused.
It must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for the city of Waters in mid-term elections, appeared on Twitter.
“If that is true, it is serious” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her cabinet had notified "the relevant institutions and law enforcement bodies regarding these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will answer for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them."
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for tips on Brexit in any new British film has become traditional, and it is also true for the recovery of an action comedy, Johnny English, who first arrived on the canvas in 2003 entitled Johnny English and continuing in 2011 entitled Johnny English 2.
Is there going to be a fun satire about how shitty we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetence Johnny English, with his eyes and unusual faces, obtains permission to re-mix the dorks; his name indicates that it is a comedian character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an awkward secret agent, who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's cane and the lack of that which contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire on the ceremony at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on the traveller and the international mystery player, who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercial for Barclay, leaving behind the real chaos.
One or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, he wore a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were short on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially because "real" films, such as 007 or Mission now impossible without bad news offer comic elements.
It seems like humor is intended for children and not so many adult viewers, which is why the events of Johnny English are not as innovative and targeted as Atkinson's silent skimming in the role of Mr Bean.
The ongoing subject is now apparent that Britain is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the British's most secret agents online network and revealed the identities of all British agents, which caused major problems to the competent agent, whom Kevin Eldon presents as a surprisingly small role.
This is the point of breaking for the Prime Minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a break because of her political incompetence: Emma Thompson, although she has done her best with the role of alleged Teresa May, there is nothing in the script that can help her.
The intelligence agency informs her that all active spies are exposed and must decide on one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny Englisha, now a teacher at a respected school who is informally teaching how to work undercover: here the writers hit because English performs some kind of spy rock academy.
They take English to Whitehall for an emergency meeting where they meet with a longtime associate named Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotype sports thriller, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is almost lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems in the name of the secret service of her Majesty, and meet Fatalko Ophelio Bulletovo, who is played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: this is the evil Jason Walt playing Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: clothed in waiters set fire in the French restaurant, create chaos when they fly over on the roof of Walt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for a seemingly reality to get to know the inside of Walt's house, it manages to create a general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energeticity it reminds of a child’s film.
Very average.
Like in other Johnny English films, I can't help myself here and think: is the British film Atkinson capable of giving a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labers deny that they plan a four-day working week for the British, and would receive a five-day working week payment.
The Labour Party Jeremy Corbin is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment for five days.
The company leader's party wants the savings created by companies due to the artificial intelligence revolution to be passed over to workers and to give them an additional day off.
So the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with a high salary.
Sources say the idea corresponds to the client's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of workers.
Unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
The source from the Labour Party said about The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is due to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-week worker is the goal we will strive to achieve by joining the client to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the client.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea as it supported the Green Party during its four-week working week campaign in the general elections in 2017.
At present, however, this objective does not support the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-week working week is not the party's policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to rip out the power of "insecure directors" and "winners" in municipal companies.
The shadow cancler's plans also mean that the current stakeholders in the water supply companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour Party could, on the basis of alleged injustices, introduce “rejections”.
He also confirmed the plans for the inclusion of workers in the management committees and the introduction of the Own Integration Funds, thus transferring 10 per cent of the shares in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the show “60 minutes” (“60 minutes”) whether their opinion could change the investigation of Kavanaugh carried out by the FBI.
The investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh, carried out by the FBI, has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In their interview on Sunday, the correspondent of the "60 minutes" of Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find anything to change her mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began
When I called him when this accusation came up, I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, undecided, unambiguous."
And Graham's voice appears to be carved into stone.
"I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change," he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett has firmly denied it,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named could have confirmed that
It's 36 years old.
I see no new change."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens (Global Citizen Festival) and has any contribution to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event where a truly remarkable type of stars participates and has the same extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. There will be a lot of trams of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest in the true purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international defence group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants of the concert had to perform a series of tasks or "acts" such as volunteering, letter to the world leader, phone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen movement, which to achieve its goal, remains 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert the right way to convince them to call for action, or is this just another example of so-called "cliticism" – to create a belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation by signing an online petition or the transmission of tweets?
The Global Citizen Movement states that since 2011 more than 19 million "acts" of its supporters have been recorded in the effort to achieve a range of different objectives.
He says that these actions have helped global leaders to accept commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that are supposed to affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group stated that the fruit of its actions should be 390 commitments and messages on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion has been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are the Food Power (The Power of Nutrition), the investor partnership and the decision-makers committed to helping children to achieve their full potential, which Rwanda has promised 35 million USD aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets of Global Citizens' Movement.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as yourself, we can bring social injustice to the historical archives,” said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador to the Food Power Partnership at the concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 acts were carried out which called on the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mother and child, the government said that it would co-finance the Power of Food project, which will achieve 5 million women and children by means of food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
The movement of the Global Citizens replied: “This will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Among some performers who will perform this year's event in New York, Janet Jackson, the weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy - the U.S. Interior Ministry for the "blockado" of Russian energy exports
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke is expected to say, after reporting from the Washington Examiner newspaper, that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East, if necessary.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it is important to warn that an excuse for researching new energy markets at the invitation of legal governments) is an excuse.
"I believe that their presence in the Middle East is a desire for energy marketing, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," he said.
According to the officials, however, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this. The Navy is making sure that our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, so as to prevent Russian energy companies from running into the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group, which is named as the "new consumer voice" in the USA.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was actually the same.
"As for Iran and Russia, the economic potential is more or less an impact on fuel and their replacement," he said, marking Russia as "a pony that knows a trick", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when Trump's administration sought to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it was intended to undermine Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump Government, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the "inappropriate" gas pipeline project Northern Stream 2, which is why Trump Berlin is supposed to be "talc" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is about unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy must not be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Union of German Industry (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The intervention of a third country in our energy supply means a great deal of difficulty for me,” German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Dieter Kempf, head of the Union of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting.
Elizabeth Warren will "extend" her candidacy in the elections to the US President in 2020, a true Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "research" her candidacy for the US President after the mid-term elections.
At the city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider candidacy.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” The Hill reported.
"After 6 November, I will examine my candidacy as president."
Warren's meeting at the city house was held by President Donald Trump, as "that's what the country is supposed to be leading in the wrong direction."
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is worrying me terribly," she said.
Warren and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh have already openly criticised Warren.
On Friday’s tweet, Warren said: “Of course, before the elections, we need an FBI investigation.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not be pushed for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk Political Research Centre, Boston Globe magazine said that a senator should not run for president, eighty-five percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, has increased support for the candidacy, with 38% to support it and 48% to oppose it.
Other high-ranking Democrats, who would be eligible for the 2020 bid, are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden, after reporting from the Associated Press, said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned a post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting to support Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What happens is that my own son, who experiences his return, connects me with other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of vulnerability that our soldiers return to,” he told the audience at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin’s arrest marked the son’s name as “the elephant in the salon” and said that her son and other war veterans were returning slightly changed, hardening, wondering where the respect for what was offered by all the fellows and aircraftmen and all the other military members of the country."
Barack Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of violence in the family by assaulting a woman, obstructing the report of violence in the family and possession of weapons in the wine state, said Dan Bennett, representative of the Waxilla police station.
18 federal states and Columbia districts support new asylum policy rejection
The 18 federal states and the Columbia District support the legal rejection of a new American policy that gives victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence the right to asylum.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district mentioned on Friday filled the court hall with a view to supporting the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v Sessions, which was not published by the American Association for Civil Liberties against Federal Policy.
She said that her partner and "his violent sons, members of the gang", abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors of the federal states supporting Grace have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of applications for asylum in the United States are coming, as countries that constantly deal with gang problems and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy annulled the decision of the IMI Committee, which allowed non-recognizable immigrants to apply for asylum in the family.
State Prosecutor of Columbia County, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "has despised decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the court said.
The state attorneys further stated in the request that the policy which denies immigrants the right to enter damages the American economy, as these are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour".
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges not to grant any more asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sessions on June 11th in his policy publication.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are taking place to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother, Ris Kusum, as she comforted her hot boyfriend at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Pal.
“The rescue workers are constantly bringing the bodies.
It lacks clean water."
It seemed to be the locals, returning to the destroyed homes that were running through the crowded things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people and hospitals were injured, destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5, were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injury, were rested outside the Paluja military hospital, where patients were treated out of the open air due to uninterrupted severe shock suns.
When he remembered the violent earthquake, which shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, in which he was inhabited with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think it pushed me against the ruins of the walls," Harris told Associated Press agency. He added that he and his family were in town because of the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses Chinese "insults" with "propagand ads"
A week after the publication of the four-page ad by the official Chinese newspaper in the American journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China Beijing accused the abuse of American press for the spread of propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned last week the paid addition of China Daily officers to Des Moines Register — the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the US congressional elections on November 6th, which China denied.
The Reuters agency reported that US federal officials had accused Trump of trying to interfere with the US Federal Elections as a new phase in Washington's increasingly intense effort to press China.
Although advertising for promotion of trade is common for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently complex in an increasingly intense trade war, in which they exchange punches by introducing customs on import products.
China's reimbursement tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to be affected by exporters in federal countries such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and formerly longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had affected US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, he wrote down Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of Officer Des Moines Register, "now he doubles this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In the dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese Government used the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish the paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have on a worrying Chinese economic path, since the clothes are strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected an offer to publish” his article, although he did not state which one.
Republicans lose elections before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh, despite multiple charges of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming mid-term elections with a loss of vote.
Feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
It cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Sirakuzah University for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November either," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced MoveOn group, on Friday, after reporting to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the Senate hall when Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, the news portal Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will exceed all borders,” said St. Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst.
“People say they are already strong, and that is true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among the unspecified elections in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president, but do not often vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which detailed her accusations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have negative consequences.
"This has become a major confusion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, after reporting from NBC News at the beginning of last week.
“It is not just about the vote of the Council or the final vote or the Kavanaugh oath; it is also about how Republicans deal with it and how they dealt with Ford,” Guy Cecil, the director of the Priorities USA, who supports Democrats, told the TV channel.
But the Americans seem somewhat divided between whether they believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, a little more supported by the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or most believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said that they certainly or most believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believe that Kavanaugh probably lied during the testimony, and only 30 percent said about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake FBA, she is currently investigating the charges made by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, was reported by Officer The Guardian.
Last week, before the Senate court council, Ford testified under oath that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, had attacked her in a sinister state.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her the sex when she was at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
Global Internet inventor intends to start a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the inventor of the world internet, is opening up a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners Open Code Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of the Inrupt was "to rule the world".
"We have decided to do this now," he said about a new company.
"It's a historic moment."
Application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create a "personal data storage store" or "pod"
This may contain contact details, job lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Similarly, if you were Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal storage facility is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls this "personal data protection".
John Bruce, executive director, says that the idea of a company is to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills that will enable access to the Solid platform to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and the volunteer programmer community.
This week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "with Facebook and Google do not discuss whether they could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight."
"We do not ask them for permission."
In a Saturday’s publication on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee wrote that the purpose of Inrupt is to “provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new internet built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a consortium of World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next age of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Holiday for Victoria Crosser from World War I · Global Voices
In his home town for 100 years, they have celebrated the award of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the English Church who had acquired it as a fighter in the first world war.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned his confession on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, a sniper shot him, so he never found out that this highest British military honor was given him.
On Saturday, at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two colonels' grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered 100 years after his grandfather’s act to earn his medal.
After reporting to the Officers of London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 through the Channel of St. Quintine "through a very dense fog and under the strong fire of the battlefield and machinery."
Later, he set sail towards the firing line and led the line forward with “the greatest heroism” and then attacked the engine room and hit three members of the squad.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on 4 October 2018 – only a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the old father's actions were "something I know and could never achieve, so he taught me humility."
With my brother, Dr. James Vann, they also laid a wreath after the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this parade," and "that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will say."
Admirers of mixed martial arts kept watch all night to watch Bellator 206 instead of the Puise Pepes.
Imagine: All night long you've been looking at a completely sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose consisted of 13 duels, including six in the main parquet, and was transported live in the UK on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Ggard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to get in touch, the UK viewers were amazed to find that the transfer was replaced by the play of Pace Pepa cartoons.
He wasn't very excited because he stayed awake until morning because of the duel.
On Twitter, one of the fans described the switch to children's cartoons as a "some kind of sick joke".
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children’s programme,” said Dave Schwarz, vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication when asked about the transfer.
"Puzza Pepa.
Bellator, Scott Cocker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule by including viewers in the UK in the future.
"When I think about replaying, I think we could work this out," Coker said.
"But there is a sixth hour there on Sunday, and we will not be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a number of messages were exchanged during the switch and not everyone was nice.
We tried to sort it out; we assumed it was just a technical mistake.
However, the real reason was the government's regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again.
Instead of six, we will endure five duels – as usual. We have tried to offer fans more than expectations and we have been saved.
This is a very ungrateful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "unworthy".
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation he felt less valuable than anyone — but it gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that "not every one of them" as he was, was seduced when he entered high school.
During the first interview in Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, said that he had spoken of gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was reduced.
For years, the regular head of the show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to months of illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast in the first show of Laverne, said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else, as "it was not socially acceptable to have boys and girls."
He said: “To date these feelings of indifference and diversity are the real thing that gives me strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was something, said he would not disappoint anyone who would finally learn about his orientation.
Twice a bronze Olympic contestant has become an influential advocate of LGBT justice and has appeared twice this year on the Union's Games in Australia to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said he was a novelist with a man - American film maker, Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 – “restended him.”
Daley married a Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, but he says that the age difference never meant a problem.
“When you have so many young people” – at the age of 14 you attended the first Olympic games and three years later his father died – he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
A couple of June adopted a child, Robert Ray Blacka-Daley's son, and Daley says that his whole view changed.
“If I were asked last year, everything I had to say would be that I “must reach the gold medal”, he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in line, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead was I finally had to admit that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympic Games in 2012 and reached a bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life – diving in Olympic games before the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of songs – the proud of the musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and in which he still had a hard skin.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 (BST).
The unprepared Mickelson saturday's Ryder Cup passed
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to return to his form so it doesn't become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for the record 12th time, left Captain Furyk sitting on Saturday's fours.
Instead of being at the centre of what was so often for the United States, the five-time winner of the day spent part of his life as a fan and in part in improving his game to repair what he weighs.
In view of the fact that even at the peak of the career, the 48-year-old does not correspond to the best narrow Le Golf National, where the long ledge inevitably punishes the wrong blows.
And if only the playground wasn't scary enough, then Mickelson will be dealing with the British Open France Molina winner in the ninth game of Sunday, who has been associated with the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who have at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals four less games, had a good start, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, or he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he rubs me on the back and hugs me with his hand and says he will be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the famous and has been in the past, and he has contributed extremely to the teams this week too.
I guess I never imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way and we thought it was necessary to do so.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup Cup Cup Cup Cup Cup.
This could mark the conclusion of Ryder's career, which never really coincided with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equations, but Furyk said that his presence in the team also brings some uncomprehensible benefits.
“He is fun, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make a fool out of people and has a wonderful place to keep him in the team room,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun when they moved with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be dug up
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage can be easily turned into an unpleasant ride at the beginning of the last day of the game of individuals in Ryder's cup.
The young Danec debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where the captain of the Seven Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans and went through the goal with only hair advantage, with a score of 14–13.
“Don’t forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but barely,” said Bjorn (at the picture) after watching the Class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led to the Le Golf National game with 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the cup isn't over yet.
Play it full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The game isn't over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal of winning this cup, and we must remain focused on it.
He says that I focus on 12 players on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world."
He was impressed with the game of his players on the demanding field, Bjorn added: "There he would never have gone too far.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
Tomorrow will be the front game of individuals, so it will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, your golfers' abilities are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow you have to get the best out of you.
Now leave your partner behind and he must get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the turning point in the last day, as in Brookline he was part of the winning team before he ended up being a loser when Europe performed "The miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, took his players to the last day of the game.
“In the morning we have 12 important games, but we would like to start as quickly as we saw in Brookline as we saw in Medina.
When this momentum is sustained, it exerts intense pressure on the middle game.
We created a proper setting and put the boys in a way, until we felt that we would do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the battle and fighting Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I have decided on this order in this group of boys because I think it covers the whole schedule," Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
New German warship suspended
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be dedicated to the use of 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the cold war, but due to the failure of systems and rapidly increasing costs will not be available until the next year, local media reported.
The handover of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leader of the new class frigate Baden-Wuertemberg, is now being transferred to the first half of 2019, says Officer Die Zeit, who lists the military representative.
The vessel should be joined by the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project raises worrying questions after delivery.
Four ships of the class Baden-Wuertemberg, ordered in 2007, will be replaced by the ageing class of Bremen.
It is expected that they will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and some cloaking technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance distances — the latest frigates should remain outside the port of home for up to two years.
However, there is no delay in the fact that top warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to influence overseas with its power, will become obsolete by the time it begins to apply, will be identified by Officer Die Ziet.
The unfortunate frigate F125 appeared last year on the cover when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the recovery are only a few known, and the German treatments have cited a number of key "programme and technical deficiencies" which would make the warship useless if it were referred to as a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important as the class of Baden-Württemberg will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the older frigates of Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the possibility of the Navy for its future upgrade.
The 7000-tonne ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” is supposed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the price of the entire project has become a problem – including crew training.
This is expected to reach a rotating EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) – from an initial EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the Navy was in fact "reduced by ships suitable for posting."
The official said that the issue has been tightened over time because the old ships have been decommissioned and the alternate vessels have not been provided.
He regretted that the Navy couldn't join any of the Baden-Wuertemberg class.
The National Fund is listening to the secret lives of bats
There is a new survey on the property in Scotland, in which they strive to discover how bats use food in hunting food.
They hope to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to help guide future conservation activities.
In the survey, the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) scientists will be accompanied by small bats and small bats and brown arrests of bats and water bats at the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
At the key sites of the property, special cameras will be set up to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The professional sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of bats and what kinds of things they do.
They will then draw up an habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, adviser to the NTS for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and all over the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risk also represents wind turbines and lighting, as well as flies and some kinds of chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as domestic cats attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
Nighttime hunting makes it more helpful with their ears than with their eyes.
In order to precisely determine errors and barriers on the way of flight, they use a sophisticated technique of echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taking bats very seriously.
He employs ten experts who regularly conduct research, inspection of refuge and occasional resolution.
The organization established even the first and for the time being, the only Scottish reserve specifically intended for bats in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The owner of the estate, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"We have an excellent area for batters on Threav," he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
But the bats are still well known, so the work we are doing here and on other properties will help us to understand better what they need to succeed.”
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance works on the premises, as the potential for the accidental destruction of a single birthright can result in death of up to 400 females and cubs, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, so they are forbidden to kill, harass, or disturb, and it is also forbidden to destroy their natives.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Anti-Top Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats, and for many species we just don't know how well their population is being held."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, and lawyers prepare for the German magazine lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo marked the charges of rape he was about to commit as "false news" and said that people wanted to "promot themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers accused that he raped an American named Catherine Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that she would then be paid 375,000 USD for her silence on the event.
In an address of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after the reporting, Ronaldo, 33, marked the reports as "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news," the 5-time winner of the Golden Ball said in a camera.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I'm a happy man and I want everyone well," a funny actor added.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the actor will demand compensation for "a non-requiring damage to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was expected to occur in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In a dossier filed at the Clark County Court in Nevada, after meeting at the Mayorga nightclub with Ronald, she was to return to the player's room, and that's where he was supposed to rape her anonymously.
Mayorga claims that after the event mentioned, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that "99% is a good person" who only disappoints in "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual relationship, but described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims to have referred to the police and recorded photographs of her injuries at the hospital, and later agreed on an extrajudicial settlement because "a terrible fear of revenge" and was concerned by "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement because the alleged event continues to have a severe trauma.
During the alleged attack just prior to the transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United, Ronaldo moved to the Italian giant Juventus this summer.
Brexit: The UK would “really regret” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would forever regret" if it lost the status of the world’s leading car manufacturer after the peach, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK for BBC said that it would temporarily suspend the production of the UK from the EU without agreement in the plant in Burnstone, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay at the border in the case of peaches without agreement could lead to job losses.
The Burnstone plant – which produces Toyota model Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if the UK left the European Union at the end of March without agreement, production in our factory would stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at the Burnston factory.
The concern about how the European Union's exit will, without agreement, affect cross-border trade has been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of peaches.
Toyota's production line operates according to the principle "on the right time" and shares suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for cars per order come every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could lead to a disturbance at the borders for which representatives of the industry say it could cause congestion and lack of parts.
Toyota in its Derbyshire factory would not be able to store for more than one day parts, the representatives of the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely moderated to avoid such border checks".
“We have to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only enjoy the current success, but grab this opportunity”, said Today BBC Radio 4.
"The data not only Toyota, but also other producers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not comment on how long the production would be stopped, and in the long term it noted that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Union trade union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, the lost job never returns."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be relocated, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, could be "set up another week" as a result of the ongoing struggle with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh, on Sunday, the White House said.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian prerogative interference, the connection between Trump's coworkers and Russia and the potential president's obstacle to the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the prosecutor's envoy, thus jeopardising Mueller's independence, has been powered by the Washington speech for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a listening device for recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, in the middle of reporting that he was planning to step down.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then announced Thursday at the United Nations Conference in New York.
Trump said that Rosenstein's "rather would not" have been forgiven and then transferred to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a single investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further suspended the Senate vote.
Trump's press rep, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could happen this week, given everything else that goes on in the Supreme Court, we could postpone it for another week.
We'll see. I always like to make sure you're informed."
Some rapporteurs would object, and Sanders has not called the White House meeting with reporters since 10 September.
Chris Wallace's show manager asked her why.
Sanders said that the rareness of meetings should not be attributed to resistance to the "set-up" of TV reporters, but said: "I could not deny that they were being placed."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President has held several press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without saying the source: “We have looked at the numbers.”
The meetings will still be held," Sanders said. "If journalists at the President of the United States can turn their questions directly, this is infinitely better than discussing me.
This is what we are trying to make possible, and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at your disposal, where you will be able to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with statesmen in guests.
The independent press conferences are rare.
In New York City, this week, the president may have shown why he appeared freely and partially bizarrely in front of his fellow journalists.
EU Health Minister's letter to NHS Scotland as regards the fear of peaches
The Minister of Health wrote to the staff of the EU working in the Scottish NHS to express the gratitude of the state and the desire to continue their work on the day of the day.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent a letter less than six months before the release of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to paying the fees for the regulation of the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on their exit, as the decision was taken closer this fall.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a great concern for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each member of staff regardless of its nationality.
Colleges from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
A linear supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, was reported by the Mike Authority in Saturday's defeat with 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team to have completed an emergency operation.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury had only occurred a little before halftime.
“He came to the edge of the playground and somehow collapsed there,” said Reed.
The coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie on the edge of the field with oxygen before putting him on board and taking him off the field for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV canal in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the details of the type/range of injury are not yet known” and that the Tenneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a freshman at the university, plays for the Tennaese State University for the first time since the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five blows together before he got out of the game, which raised his total number of blows in the season to 18 hits.
Foreign customers will be charged higher fees when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign customers will be charged higher fees when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new toric plans
The move will neutralize Corbin's success in attracting young voters
Increased collage will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The warehouse expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, and it's going to help the homeless.
When buying real estate in the United Kingdom, foreign customers will be charged with a higher rate of stake and the money collected will be paid to the homeless, Theresa May will be reported today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure affordable housing and to increase the taxation of people with high income.
Elevated collage will be charged to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and additional money will encourage government efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The allowance, which will be charged in addition to the current hip, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estates, could amount to no less than three per cent.
The Foundation expects to collect up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that non-states of the United Kingdom should buy 13 percent of the newly built London real estate, resulting in price hikes and a harder purchase of first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “soul cities”, as the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for the reduction of the hip to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The large construction companies charged price increases with land consumption, which they did not actually use, and Mr Mayevo called on them to suspend quotas for affordable housing in order to repair the British "staying shame."
Mr Corbin announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and the completion of forced emigration without error.
In addition, he wants to give city councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. Mayeva said: “I said last year that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means correcting our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, to work and to create a life.
But it can't be right that for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, and for foreign companies, buying home is as simple as for the British citizens of Bulgaria.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to manage the Scotland Club"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "fine goal" once was to become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently occupys the third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-class.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after St Mirren took the last season back to the Scotland Championship.
“For my country, I wanted to play as an actor.
I received a B cap, and that was it," Ross said of the BBC Scotland's Sportshow show.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if you were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Allo Athletic team, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that he had not felt fear as a successor to such great names.
“The success is measured for me by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the First League?’”
According to the structure and capacity this club certainly belongs to the First League," he said.
"The path to there is not easy, but it would probably be considered successful only if the club could take it back again."
Ross has only done the work of the manager for three years after his assistant leader in Dumberton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped prevent the fallout in the third league and St Mirren led off the edge of the fall to the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real turning point,” remembers Alloe.
“I was truly convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It's funny because it went well for me as an actor, and I had a relatively good time, and I've also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
A number of things should be faced every week.
In terms of stress and pressure at work, I still face it, but management just feels like the right thing for me.
I always wanted to run a club and now I do it. In my skin in my entire adult life I feel the most comfortable."

Results of the study: ideal time for beer is on Saturday at 17.30
Summer heat has increased the revenues of difficult British pubs, but the pressure on the restaurant chains has also increased.
The pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business advisor to CGA, who prepared the data, said: “The continued solar time and participation of England in the world Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that it followed a similar pattern as in June in the past month when pub income increased by 2.8 percent, only that restaurants were affected even more strongly.
The fall in traffic in restaurants by 1.8% in June increased further in July.
Traffic in pubs and drinking bars increased more in comparison than in restaurants.
Suntime also reduced sales in pubs that offer mainly food, but not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman of the group of analysts for leisure and hospitality RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
For sale on the catering market, time and impact remain the greatest factor of great social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the decline by 4.8% on an annual basis will be particularly painful because of the constant cost pressures.
It could not have come at a more wrong time for the owners of food bars for a long summer, and only time will tell if recovery will be necessary to bring more moderate temperatures that we have experienced in August."
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, indicating the slow introduction of trademarks.

One of the five children has a secret account on the social network that he hides from his parents.
Research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account hidden from parents and teachers on a social network
A poll among 20,000 students showed the growth of false Instagram pages
News strengthens fears about publishing sex related content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account for parents
One of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — creates an account hidden from parents on social networks.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The news strengthened fears about publishing sex related content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a censored "main" account they show parents, but also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into the secret side of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter invited the visitors to rape her.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 per cent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and half of them acknowledge that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create a website where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of its extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We are confident that the athletics in Scotland would gain a great deal with its inclusion in the committee," Beatie said.
Doyle said: “I am impressed that I will be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute to and assist in sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200m and 400m in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to speak after a transient ischaemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I got hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only be time to tell if I could recover and to what extent.
Work was hard, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I perform exercises for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
An advert for the chest pump comparing mothers with cows has distributed online opinions
The company producing chest pumps shared views with an ad comparing mothers with cows at milk.
In order to start the marketing of the “first silent portable chest pump”, Elvie’s consumer technology company published a provocative music video ad to the mothers to show all the freedom that the device provides.
Four real mothers dance in the society of a cow in a hay-filled stable, in a song that includes the following words: "Yes, I draw, but there is no tail to look at," and "If you haven't noticed, these are not my sessions, these are my tits."
The collection continues: "Taste, run out, feed the babies, run out, run out, squeeze the breasts."
However, the ad published on Facebook’s website has caused considerable disapproval on the Internet.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it was joked about the account of the "grossote" of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also become pregnant and skewed to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them during the first days after the quote," wrote one.
Elvie’s chest pump is discreetly suited to breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
The second commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and youngster.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, "Ad completely unfeeling."
The others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought the song was "for a dead laugh".
“This seems like a genius idea.
I'd buy it, too, if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when drawing.
The ad's a little crazy, but I understood it, just like it was meant to be.
This is a genius product,” wrote the second one.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad targeting mothers who exhaust their milk (often in a workplace or toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were dancing with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw breasts say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump's pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and is discreetly fit into breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, keep the baby and even activities at large during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, further commented. "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a bold and provocative presentation."
By drawing a parallel between women who draw milk, and cows of milk, we wanted to pay attention to the focus of drawing milk and all its challenges, while in a fun way to connect women, we wanted to show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring..
This is not the first case when the Elvie pump came to the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother took two children on the model track for designer Marto Jakubowski when using the product.
Hundreds of migrants' children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased greatly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to surrender to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to put their chances at risk by applying for a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of the households would have to issue fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had applied for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are punished foreigners.
We therefore continue to search for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month after being detained, and not after 60 days of what was the previous standard, workers in the shelter said.
Many will appear with a videoconferencing call, not personally, to defend themselves before the immigration judge.
Those who are not entitled to aid will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to prison statements and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
The advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the signs of the child’s distress due to their size are more likely to remain undetected.
They added that moving children into the city of tents, without emotionally preparing them, or giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to friends, could entangled the trauma many of them face.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, even if war has been going on in the country for eight years.
Moualem, who also performs the tasks of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will also act accordingly".
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw," he said to the assembly.
Moualem said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 36,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to be left home, "almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we have cleaned up the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, the United Nations have some 2,000 soldiers who are primarily training and counseling Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war.
As regards refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for return were appropriate for them, and accused "some Western countries" of "extending unreasonable fears" that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
"The international community and humanitarian organisations have called on them to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"The political issue is changing, which should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive recovery funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last important rebel range, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against Jihadists, including Fronta Nusra fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistur, hopes to convene soon the first session of the new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to prepare a postwar constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem identified the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will reach second term
Following this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as likely to be, numerous liberal viewers, his presidency will soon end with an interpretation and scandal.
Which would be without a doubt "the most dramatic final of the presidency ever!"
So far, there's no sign of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s ratings at the time of maximum viewing have doubled to 1,05 million and MSNBC’s ratings have almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News Channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its highest ratings, which more than four years ago, when it had 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on night news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the director of the drama “Designated Survival”, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and some hard truths about how to spy at the Hollywood Boys Club," offers a different explanation.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what it looks like on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe vs. Wad case, given whether immigration families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, six hours of viewing the round table of experts discussing the use of the "deep background source" for the book "Straight" Bob Woodward, 15,000 USD valuable jackets from Noah's leather ("the clothing, fat-substantiated with oil", said the Officer The Washington Post, and the consequences of shocking descriptions of Trump, hm, anatomia.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria again.
“The part of his beginning, which inspires the impression of a reality show, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “Pawn Stars” about the meeting of Trump's show and the daily screws of the script (the match with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to let go of an episode, or you'll find yourself behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 80 degrees (26.7 °C) outside his home on the north coast of Kauai (26.7 °C), but he was stuck inside watching MSNBC when he recorded CNN.
There was no way he could have cut himself off, even when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the air.
"I remember then we created all these crazy shows and people said, "This is the end of Western civilization," Mr Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is spent preparing for the most close mid-term elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th pension district they see a flood of money, because the re-orientation of the two candidates' congress districts was in the race for the same seat.
This recently to a newly divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which is heavily covered in the new 17th district.
The cards were printed on a new one, when the Pennsylvania Supreme Judge ruled in January that the old districts had been anti-contained for the benefit of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district touched the fight to finance the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congress Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
The name "Lomb" became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the broadly monitored March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators attribute to Democrats a slight advantage.
In the U.S., they were considering sanctions against Salvador for support of China, then retreated.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with only a little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varello in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the leadership of Trump's organization.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry decided to recall the US leadership of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama are red "the recent decisions to end the recognition of Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the ministry's representative at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were considered with regard to Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140 million in 2017 of US aid, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included the restriction of financial assistance and a targeted restriction on visa issuance, would seriously affect the Central American State with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials suspended a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, ending their reflections on the penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing conference participants now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed on them on a condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government who also spoke about it on the condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be Robert Mueller's special adviser's report on possible obstacles to the judicial authority, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also looking at whether Mr. Trump's campaign worked with Russia in the attack on the US elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Mr Trump will have to speak to these authorities and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues is held accountable at the moment when he prepares to speak to his constituents again.
There are many issues in this, and I do not wish to claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is its peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long-term the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were willing to strike Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed to miss the opportunity to avoid the flight of worship that followed.
Such gaps change the course of history and accelerates or inhibits the unforgivable march of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with several such credentials right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man with the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein, however, has reported that last year, he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated on his incomparability to this situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the report of Officer The Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or appointed Supreme Judge despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And in particular, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a congress that will require Mr Trump's responsibility?
If we fail on these tests, there is a long winter democracy waiting for us.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and told me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on the table with swastikas.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, and it is clear that they will be won by Austrians after an impressive remission against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month in a convincing position for the qualification of the G League Group.
The damage to the knee was prevented by federal actor Graham Dorrans from appearing first in the season before the 2:2 remium against Villarreal, but thought that the Rangers could use it as a bounce for greater achievements.
“This was a well-deserved point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said 31-year-old.
“In the game we entered the belief that we could achieve something and take the point away.
Perhaps we could eventually win the win, but in general, the rummy is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed ourselves and we were better away in the second half.
On Thursday, there will be another big European night.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but with a crowd for us I am sure that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place right now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
A weak sleep of women because of the fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people discussed this with their family members.
Half of the respondents in the Nacionwide survey said that they were talking to spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent of them said that they talk to children about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t try to discuss it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nation’s life insurance sector, Nacionwide.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare families for your care unless you talk to her about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in the cost assessment.
Include a financial consultant: Your financial adviser can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term supply financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of transition.
Choose a medical representative by identifying a trustworthy person who will monitor your healthcare and ensure that experts comply with your health requirements if you cannot communicate.
Consider also authorising a person for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not able to do so yourself.

In Ilfracomb, a man was shot several times with an air rifle.
One of the men who came home at night was shot several times with an air rifle.
The shooter, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot several times in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 in British time as a "random act".
She didn't see the victim of her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called on potential witnesses to report back.
quakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims was expected to increase further.
In the case of interrupted communications connections, the rescue workers from the Donggal regency, the areas north of Paluja, which is closer to the earthquake epicentre of the magnitude 7.5, could not obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Some key information on Palu and Donggali in Sulavesia:
Palu is the capital of central Sulavesia, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulaveza and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was affected by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Dongala is a province that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast on the north-west of the island of Sulavesa.
The registration, the administrative unit under the province, was estimated to have a population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province are the Central Alliances of aquaculture and farming, in particular in the Donggala Central Region.
In the province, there is also an important activity in the mining of nickels, which is mostly carried out in Morales, on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
After reporting from the Indonesian Agency for the mitigation of the consequences of natural disasters over the past 100 years, Palu and Donggalo have repeatedly affected tsunamis.
In 1938, tsunamis caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996 the tsunami was also affected by the northern Donggalo and caused the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia sits on a shockingly active Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes appear regularly here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
A larger earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and caused 226,000 people to die along the coast of India's estimate, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The type of severe earthquakes was affected by Western Sumatro late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatre.
2006: The earthquake of Magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of Magnitude 7.6 took place near Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of Magnitude 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai and launched a tsunami of up to 10 metres which destroyed the dozen villages and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: The flood of earthquakes was affected by the regentry of Pedia Jaya in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami didn't go off, but the fallen buildings caused more than 100 people to die.
2018: Major earthquakes were affected by Indonesian tourist island Lombok and resulted in the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily kept thousands of tourists.
Arresting Sarah Palin's oldest son for domestic violence
Barack Palin, the oldest son of former governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
29-year-olds from Wasilla, Alaska, were arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, obstacles to domestic violence and resisting arrest, Alaska State Troopers police agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, took the phone out of hand.
The Palina was detained at the Matt-Su Predicate Institute and was in custody under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, the KTUU TV network reported.
In court he appeared on Saturday, where he said he was "certainly innocent" when asked about the conspiracy, the network reported.
The Palina accused three A-class violations, which means they could lock him up for up to one year and punish him with a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with one class B offence punishable by one day in prison and a fine of USD 2000.
Palin's crime was not charged for the first time.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Mother Sarah Palin called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the application of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticized her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service to Iraq.
A tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulaves on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks are interrupted and the number of fatalities is expected to increase further in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to central Sulavesia, located northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
On social media, they circulate videos showing the moment of the earthquake.
When tsunamis hit the shore, hundreds of people held back at the beach festival in Palo.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death sentence for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York City are demanding a death sentence for Siful Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died. It is a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was to use the rental delivery truck to carry out the attack on the cycling routes along West Side highways on Lower Manhattan when he took over several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, it is written in a notice of the death penalty application lodged in the South District of New York.
After the court document, the cause of the death penalty may be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, the Grand Federal jury took note of the indictment at 22 counts involving eight counts of murder to help blackmail usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime and the charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and intent", the prosecutors said, describing Saip's way as "outcast, cruel and defiant."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchia, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” was written in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The South District Court issued the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendants of Khalid Barnes were convicted of killing two drug suppliers and finally turned his sentence into a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last pronounced in New York City in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married to a couple who were killed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenberg were killed on the electric table on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipo told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos he was looking at on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that they required the flag of ISIS in their hospital room.
As far as 22 counts are concerned, he pleaded guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipo, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty instead of taking the blame in exchange for living in prison without the possibility of letting go of all involved will only extend suffering in connection with these events," Patton said.
Saip's defense group had previously asked prosecutors not to seek capital punishment.
In order to negotiate with regard to peaches, we should be in charge of NIGEL Faragea, a true Torian Member
Nigel Farage, today during the protest at the Torian Conference, promised to "mobilize the human army".
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians must "feel heat" of Eurosceptics when one of their own Members, Theresa May, suggested that they should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
On the march in Birmingham, conservative Member Peter Bonne said that the United Kingdom would be "already out now" if Mr Farage's secretary of peaches were to be.
However, the challenge facing Ms. Mayeva in coordinating her deeply divided species has been highlighted by the Torics, favored with the resignation of the peaches who have joined a separate protest against peaches in the city.
The prime minister is seeking to maintain his plan in line between the attacks of the peaches, the peaches and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and laborists to choose between its package and "coloss".
Mr. Bonne is at the convention Leave Means Leave (department means departure) in Solhiul that "he wants to get rid of the Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as a co-rapporteur and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would be out by now," he said.
This Member from Wellingborough added: "I will support the peach, but we must get rid of the Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU as saying: “In the world wars, we did not fight to be servants.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr. Bonne rejected the proposals that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The thought that the British had changed their minds and wanted to remain in the EU is totally unreal."
The meeting was also attended by Tori peaches, Andrea Jenkins, who told the rapporteurs: “I am simply saying: ‘The Ministerial President, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular with the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unloved with our client and our activists who are active in the streets and lead us to the election at all.
Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In a message intended for Mrs Mayove, she added: "The Prime Ministers keep their job when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said at the meeting that policies should be given “feeling hot” if they intend to make a decision adopted in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
“They are trying to issue the peach, and today we are gathered to tell them, ‘We will not let you do this’.”
In his message, the excited crowd added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of the issue of peaches, to make you feel the heat.”
"We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has provided us with victory in the peaches, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the others walked through Birmingham, where they then had a two-hour meeting at the city center.
After the group was set up, a handful of activists waved on the flags of the Torians against the peaches this weekend.
The Labour noble Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for security problems when using the client's application after opening the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for a free border, free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good peach," he added.
Warren's possible push for president's position "expected"
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "partnership in the race for the Presidential City will study closely" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe daily reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke of their future at a meeting with citizens in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will compete for re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of the Trumpo election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the heart of speculation in order to cope with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of “town hall”, since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to go after the president.
Warren said it's time for "a woman's nest in Washington to repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrested after the death of LSU Sims in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in the shooting of a basketball player named LSU Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Station reported the news of the 20-year-old Simpson's arrest at a press conference at 11am Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the online shooting and asked for help in identifying the person on the tape.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the South University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot to the head and thus finally died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul reported on the 247ports network.
Wade got involved in protecting his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene of the murder, that he had a weapon, and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resisting and taken to custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 beginnings in the last season, average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps in the game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton drew close to the world champion's title, and the team ordered him to leave his victory to Sebastian Wattle
On Saturday, it became clear the moment Walteri Boltas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton that "the team of Mercedes will have a strong impact on the race".
Bottas was well-started and almost left Hamilton dry when he defended his position in the first two bandages and invited Vettla to attack his male male male teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes drove into boxing later and left him behind Vettlo, but Hamilton noticed after a few driving actions that the Ferrari driver was leaving the inside open and risked being left behind after two defence moves in the third corner.
Max Verstoppen started with the last kind of net and was on his 21st birthday in the seventh place by the end of the first round.
Then, most of the race was driven without changing the tire, as he intended to perform a quick finish, overrun Kimi Raikkonen and take the fourth place.
He finally drove into the 44th round, but in the remaining eight circles he couldn't increase his speed, so the fourth place was occupied by Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Walters drove fantasticly all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me behind.
The team did an extraordinary job to reach the first and second places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad physical rumor.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at Saturday's meeting because of her insistence that she did not disclose the letter to Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate investigative commission, but instead he said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, corrupt and false".
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at publications and disclosures, people say ‘No, I didn’t do this’.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document – "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not disclose it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it... no, we didn't,” he added about the senator's impression.
Fordova sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was disclosed in early September — but Feinstein denied that it had come from her office.
“I didn’t cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn’t disclose her letters,” she told the Commission after reporting to The Hill Feinstein.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept him as confidential as she asked."
However, her denial obviously did not suit the president, who said at the meeting Saturday night: “I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
It may not be true, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
In defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by the three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president suggested that they abuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power by all means.
You have seen evil, disgustingness, they don't care who gets hurt and who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediate said after reporting the Mediate website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars versus Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars has redeemed themselves for losing the Elite League to Belfast Giants by winning the Saturday match at Dundee 5:3.
The Giants were taken early for two goals at the hands of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawnie were equal to the home side, and then Dwyer regained his advantage for the Giants.
Frances Bouchard evend for Dundees before the two goals of Lundvald Nielsen provided them with victory.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee at 2:1 on Friday night from the back.
This was the fourth meeting of the season among the teams, with Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer reached the first goal in the game in the fourth minute of 3:35 p.m. by the assistant of Kendal McFaulla, Beauvilier, who hit four minutes later, and gave David Rutherford.
In the intensive opening work, Sullivan took the game home at 13:10 p.m., and Matt Marquardt gave it to Cowni for equality at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' leadership on vacation when he hit his second naked night at the end of the first third.
The home side was reassembled and the Bouchard was compensated for with a forceful goal at 27:37.
Cawnie and Charles Corcoran unitedly contributed that Nielsen took Dundees to the advantage at the end of the second third and took care of the victory with the fifth goal of his team half-time and took care of the victory with the fifth goal of his team in half of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller, with his death, has allowed hundreds of people on the plane to escape from an earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after sacrificing his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people died in a higher earthquake on the island of Sulavez, followed by the tsunami, and many are missing.
The area continues to be shaken by powerful earthquake suns, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Pal.
Although coworkers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonyus Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a highly escalating control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport Pala.
He remained in it so that the aircraft Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought he was being pushed.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's representative, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, the Australian media house ABC News reported.
We've prepared a helicopter to be transported from Balikpan to Kalimantan to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our heart is racing when we hear it," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, as the Agency said that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Bouton is limited.
"The number of dead is supposed to increase even more because there were many bodies under the ruins and many of them we could not reach," said the agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The palace, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves up to six metres high.
Military and commercial planes bring help and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings bodies.
We're running out of clean water.
Minimarkets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
It is now a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal and addressed the national army: “All of you I ask that you work night and day to fulfil all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" After CNN's report.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok at the beginning of this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that after the plane crash in the lagoon one man is missing
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Minnesota, now says they miss one man after they initially reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the diving plane.
On Saturday afternoon, Air Niugini announced that the passenger of the male sex was missing.
The airlines said that they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in finding the missing.
The call for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality, did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane hit the water when they tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials said they had taken seven people to the hospital.
The airlines said there were eight passengers left at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the track.
Some witnesses said the plane was missing the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed very low.
"This is extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers managed to make it through the belt of rising water to emergency exits on a diving plane.
He said the stewardess set off panic and cried out, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were fixing the piers were also helping to help. They helped by using an inflatable boat to take people to land before the plane sank into about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that during the last two decades in air accidents in Papua-New Guinea, 111 people died, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
Analytical determined the time of night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial to a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has been testifying for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received data on the location from several cell phones that showed that Tellis had been with Chambers on the eve of her death, contrary to his previous claims, reported Officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' at the time he said he was with a friend of Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed it on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "a liar because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
The second inconsistencies were that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone at the time of Chambers' death.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury was to be judged on trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
The hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol argues that hiphop has distanced itself from its initial political and social engagement.
They want to return to his roots and remake conscious hiphop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently re-embarked with artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
New York's nanny is suing a couple for firing her for "rasistic" message.
The New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatingly firing her after receiving the wrong message from the mother who complained that she was "another black."
A couple deny the racist treatment and compares the action to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived, found that she was black.
“NEEEEEEEE IS THE CREDIT,” wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxmanov in her message.
But instead of sending him to his husband, he was sent twice by Mrs. Maurice.
After finding out her slip, Plasco-Flaxmanov, who felt "uneasy", Mrs. Maurice fired, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had been doing a bad job, so she wanted to hire Filipino, reported Officer New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she and Uber sent her home.
Maurice is now asking the court for compensation of USD 350 per day for a period of six months to perform the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, such things are not done,” she said about Post on Friday, adding, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by claiming that the layoff of Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid that they would no longer be able to trust her after the insult.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," the husband, Joel Plasco, told Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
In comparison with the "immigration" action, Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to get over someone like this?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the proceedings before the court are still pending, the Court of Justice has quickly condemned the public opinion of a couple on social networks because of their behaviour and thinking.
The publishers of Bear Paddington's stories feared that the readers would not connect with the talking bear revealed a new letter.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put into the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an exceptional success."
She said that her father, who originally worked as a cameraman for BBC before he got the inspiration to write a baby book about little bear toys, would be bitter when he refused his work, she added that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book "Grenko-sweet".
With regard to Paddington's bear, which she described as a "very important member of our family", she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man who did not like to boast," she said.
“But because Paddington the bear was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You are proud of him even if you do not do it yourself.
I think he looked at Bear Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed the bear Paddington to himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
At the dock, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried for nothing to preserve her life.
“Hope regularly called to say that she really felt bad that she did not expect this to happen,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nadov’s call, and he told me that in the next two minutes she would die, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given by doctors to keep her heart pumping, slowly disintegrated and abandoned her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position where my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Ms. Ednan Laperouse, who has already complained about losing her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, an unconscious test she is going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I had my head taken off, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this intense feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Grieving women's leprosy posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one for suicide are trying to turn others away from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valiant Bridge, with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he got depressed, and he killed himself at age 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a flimsy smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile brightened every room."
But before he died, he stopped working because he “was in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters, "to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not sit in silence – you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Davies for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise," she said.
“Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the presents, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
She said that his death was a serious trauma to them, but they have to process it: "She cut a hole in the whole family.
She broke us up.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the start of an FBI investigation in the air
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for – after the duration and scope of a limited investigation, this might bring us together,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would suffer from a certain party’s failure.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time in which the investigation would take place.
By the mid-term elections, which will take place on November 6th, only five weeks – if, as expected, Republicans cut off poorly, this will greatly weaken them in trying to elect a wanted man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush repeatedly telephoned the senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and presented by his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can raise at least 50 votes in the Senate, which could bring Mike Pence, the Vice President, a breakthrough from the stalemate and election to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean fugitives fell under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean Member said.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to data from the South Korean Association Ministry, said 1127 people fled last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were stricter border control between North Korea and China and the increase in prices required by human smugglers.
Pjongyang has yet to publicly comment on this.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized area between the two Koreans.
China is considered refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South — which are technically still at war — have improved significantly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjang for talks focusing on stalearisation negotiations.
This took place after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young Uno, Singapore, where they generally agreed on efforts to make the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho attributed the US sanctions to a standstill since then.
"Without confidence from the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be unilaterally disarmed," Mr Ri said in a statement from the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh as "histerican" and says he's not fit for a job in the Supreme Court.
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi’s representative home marked the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh as "histern" and said that he was significantly inappropriate for his service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosiev said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything else, but that if I were to act like a woman, I would mark myself as “hysteric”,” Kavanaugh’s Thursday testimony to the Senate’s investigative commission commented on Pelosi.
Kavanaugh severely denied the charges that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were still teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost cried out, and he had a little talk about his family and his high school age.
He explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Commission and marked the charges against him as "grothesical and coordinated mudsling", organised by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony has proved that he must not be appointed Supreme Judge, since it has shown that he is biased to Democrats.
"I believe that with such statements and the way he dealt with Clinton and the Democrats, he was discredited," she said.
Pelosi is on the question whether Kavanaugh will try to press constitutional charges if it is confirmed and the Democrats will get most in the House of Representatives, for a moment become.
"I will say this – if the Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court on which it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi said that as a democratically concerned by the possible Kavanaugh decision against the Law on Access to Health or the Roe v Wad case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to go hysterical, biased person to court and expect us to say ‘Is this wonderful?’” said Pelosi.
And a woman's got to hold him.
It's a fair fallout, after months and years of anger spilling, and it can't express it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It doesn’t seem rare to me, do you think?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was also the director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, namely when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said, ‘Maybe I feel sad to you because I am crying.
I am angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was top-notch."
Tears are like a way out of anger, partly allowed because people get it wrong.
One of my most powerful memories of my early career, when I was still working in the office where men prevailed, and I once found myself crying in unspeakable anger, was the event when an older woman grabbed me by the neck — a cold leader who was always a little afraid that dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll rejoice that they've touched you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping across a boat over a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply depressed that there was no reason why the president couldn't run for himself.
“This was not a well-thinked decision,” she told me in laughter 30 years later.
“ Seven other candidates have participated in the game, and one last thing was the last.
Someone then called the game “Snow and Seven Thumbs”.
As the last campaign was joined, it was lagging behind in fundraising, so it decided not to enter the competition unless it collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I'm getting a discount?” she wondered.
When she said that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with a system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and the anger of sexism — so overcome that she began to choke.
“We would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs Schroeder remembered the media reaction.
"We would think that my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my grave.
“Did she cry?”
How the war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The initial salves of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle has not been completed long ago, experts say that the gap between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the American President, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion ($150 billion), which effectively means the taxation of half of all goods coming from the USA from China.
Beijing has been retaliated every time by equivalent retaliatory measures, lastly with tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed to moving an eye for an eye with the United States, and is likely to not be blinked soon.
In order to allow Washington to give up, China should agree to its requirements, but the public removal of the US to China President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
Experts, however, say that if Beijing knows how to make the right moves, US pressures in the trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long term in order to reduce the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic shock in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a professional associate focusing on Asia in the brain trust Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to return to the refugees voluntarily, asking for help in restoring the country that has been devastated in more than seven years of war.
According to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer in order to fight terrorism," he said.
The government continues to resuscitate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal state.
All conditions are now met for refugees who had to be left on a voluntary basis for terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimate that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the restoration of a devastated state.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe Wins Victory in Ryder's Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France, won the Ryder Cup for 2018.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soils and the Ryder Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the championship, had to hand the game over to Francesc Molinari at the 16th hole in a couple-3 game with his initial punch.
Italian golfers Molinari shined through all circles and became one of the four players who had achieved a score of 5-0-0 ever since the start of the championship in the current form of 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth, with 5 and 4, defeated the lowest-ranked European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Powerer of England, who may have played the last one in Ryder's cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, has become the most successful European player in the championship of all time.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been hard this year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in me.
So happy, I'm so happy we won the cup again.
It's a team, and I'm really glad I could help," Garcia said emotionally after European victory.
He teaches his cousin John Ram, who, on Sunday with 2 and 1 in the games of individuals, beat the American legend of Tiger Woods golf.
“I feel incredibly proud to have managed to defeat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France to play them, and now he's got a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been working helplessly all week to find the right way, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf all over the championship.
After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said: "I am so proud of these boys, they fought."
In the morning, we put some pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Klobuk down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to get together again, and I'm going to be working with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move on.
I really love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Drop it.
They overplayed us."
