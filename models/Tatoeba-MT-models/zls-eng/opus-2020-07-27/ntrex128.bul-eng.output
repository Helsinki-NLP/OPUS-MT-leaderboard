Wells’s Assembly members worry that “they look like muppets ”
Some of the members of the Assembly are mocked by the proposal to change their title to "HUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal has been provoked by plans to change the name of the Wels Paramenta.
Members of the entire political spectrum worry that this may be a cause for ridicule.
One of the Leyberists said that his group was worried about the new name being “rhyming with Tup and Udlb. ”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one party member Plaid, the whole group is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh conservative party has indicated that his group is "not preconvinced" to the change of name, but notes that the new name CHR (in English – MWP) has a certain reputation with a "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W refers similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up the draft law to change the name, made the following statement: “It is clear that the final decision on all the descriptive names to which the members of the Assembly are called will belong will belong. ”
The Wels Government Act of 2017 gave Wales the power to change his own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to begin calling itself the 'Wels' Parliament.
As far as the position of its members is concerned, the Commission prefers "members of the Veles Parliament", in short, but the "CUP" option has received the greatest support after a public hearing.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching a consensus is likely to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft draft on the change up to a few weeks.
The Reform Law will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the committee system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to debate the bill.
Macedonians to vote in a referendum whether to change their country's name
Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve the ongoing dispute with neighbouring Greece for decades, in which there is an administrative area called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name of the state, said he would not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Cambans are silent on the backdrop of the Church's difficulties in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and church literally on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today they're both missing."
Adams shares that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways," he added.
"Baras are no longer neighborhoods, where everyone gathers regularly."
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be in the same situation. ”
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people live who do not help survive the other sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as most of the new settlers are unlikely to visit them."
Both churches were built by white pastures, before Harlem became the neighborhood of black people – the Metropolis community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist pasture was carried out in the years after 1930.
Then the building became owned by the black people of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was taken by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organised a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, since they did not want to hire black people.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's Enoriases made up a plan for her restoration, which ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them "the poor bells."
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural Treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world to be used by a black musician - Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the largest system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariweather mentioned that St. Martin had never been replaced.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few weeks has been a complex story played by architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church and others by the bishopic diocese.
From the newsroom – which is the governing body of the pasture, consisting of world leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concerns that the eparchy would “be inclined to transfer the costs of the newsroom” although he had no role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some oenoriashi have complained of lack of transparency by the eparchy.
A 13-year-old kid was injured by a shark in a lobster hunt in California.
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while it was fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, representative authorities reported.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends about half an hour a Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and let himself go along with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hammel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then he realized how he cried out, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got to the boy, he found out that his whole area was torn apart.
"I called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was accepted in critical condition.
It's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior, Captain Larry Gilles, has spoken to a media briefing that several weeks earlier in the water, was spotted a shark, but it is estimated not to be a dangerous species.
Gils adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
From the responsible authorities have closed access to the coast line from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Enstinas for 48 hours of safety considerations as the investigation runs.
Gils notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not pose a threat to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the UK market for beautiful products
Sainsbury faces the Boots, Superothers and Debenhams, opening stands for beautiful products in its sites where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK market for beautiful products, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to increase while the sales of fashion and household products are falling, the largest stations for decorative products will be located in 11 stores throughout the country, then, in the success of the initiative, such ones will be found in other objects.
The investment curve in the beautiful industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the lathes, until recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said they would double the number of beautiful products offered up to 3000 products, for the first time including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space similar to the proposals in the Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-enters its battery range of makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will test concession programmes in two stores of Sainsbury, the first of which opened in Croyden, southern London last week, while the second one will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving focus on buying smaller quantities of food daily at comfortable times leads to supermarkets having to make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, said the sites would look more and more like universal shops, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury they have objects of Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as objects of Habitats since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claimed increased the sales of food goods and made the profits even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain has failed to refuse its objects for decorative and pharmaceutical products.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Booths in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 sites of Celesio, which owned the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, CEO of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the kind and character of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the site.
The range of brands offered by us aims to respond to every taste and all necessary in a convenient environment, thus making us an attractive destination for beautiful products, which challenges the concept itself in the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "freaked" after Holly Wilby's refusal of a deal for 11 million pounds
Dragons Den Peter Jones' star “has got pissed off” after television leader Holly Wilby gave up a deal for 11 million pounds with his Lifestal company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilby doesn't have time for the brand household appliances and accessories of Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand of Ginette Poltrou.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced leaving in Instagram.
Holly Wilby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to statue" after withdrawing from their income business with the brand products for the Lifestal at the last minute – in order to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones "has got angry" when the "gold girl" of television confessed during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that its new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean there will be no more time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to the Goop brand of Ginette Poltrou, with rumors being that it has doubled the wealth of Wilby, whose value is forecasted to 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Wilby announced in Instagram leaving Truly, Jones left Britain by plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One of the sources shared the following: “Trouly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be its long-term commitment to ensure its future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave has completely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlow's headquarters that's full of waiting for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of this morning, one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions because of the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a delay in placing the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it could also mean the end of one long friendship.
Wilby, who mothered her to three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Wilby herself founded Truly along with Cap in 2016, such as Jones, who was 52, joined the company's chairman in March.
Both families often go on vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television company.
Wilby will become an MP for the M&S brand and will also replace Anne McCarlin as the head of the ITV broadcast.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: “We will not comment on his business affairs. ”
Heavy negotiations leading to "relationship"
He joked about the criticism he would bring from news channels to make comments that someone would consider "unsuitable for the president" and as too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his joke "new" way.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim showed interest in the second meeting after the first one took place in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as "a major step towards removing North Korean nuclear weapons".
But negotiations to eliminate this weapon are in stalemate.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea diplomat Ri Jung Ho told UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea "does not see the reciprocal attitude" by the United States towards its country's first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were heading for war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve Kim's relations led to positive results – the termination of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return to the bodies of US military personnel.
He also protected his non-orthodoxical approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded zone, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd ahead.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate the island and lead to the deaths of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok by foreign NGOs, they were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement to initiate international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it is expressed that no international aid is required, which makes things slightly challenging," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is putting together a team to head to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
Mr Sutopo, the National spokesman of the disaster agency, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains still unprepared for this type of natural disasters.
Although the Achehs were built shelters in the case of tsunamis, they are not often a common view on the other shores.
The apparent lack of warning siren for tsunamis in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicated even more this logistics.
Until recently stationed in Lombok for serving earthquake victims, a hospital ship headed to Palu, but it will be at least three days before he succeeds in reaching the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of the lag infrastructure of Indonesia into the centre of his campaign, investing a large amount of funds in roads and railway lines.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joco is re-reading the urns next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectant pressures in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with torture, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Watch: Daniel Streige brought a late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Streige saved Liverpool from losing in the High League against Chelsea with a goal in 89 minutes this Saturday on "Stamford Bridge" in London.
Strydge got a pass from Gerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was behind 1-0.
He set up the ball on his left leg, then fired a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penal field and headed towards the upper right corner of the net.
She transferred the floating Kepa Arisabala and entangled yourself insecurely into the net.
"I was trying to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shak are always looking for submissions in front positions, so I was just trying to get as much time as I could for a good shot at the door," Streige told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen Cante, I've pushed my ball, and I've just shot without thinking too much."
Chelsea led 1-0 at 25 minutes after the goal of his Belgian star One Azar.
The attacker of the "sons" filed five to Mateo Kovacic, then stopped from midfield to half of Liverpool.
Kovačič exchanged a quick double pass at the center.
Then he released a fast shot dog, which brought Azar out into a clean position in the penal field.
Azar outruns the defenders and marks with his left foot in the far corner next to Liverpool's goalie Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Championship League group stage at 15:00 this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3:00 a.m. Thursday in London.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue turns into the latest memorial hit by "rewrite history"
Her ban will be poetic justice for his nearly Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "freak" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace to become a goal.
The economy of the English civil wars has not been ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft was proof of the 19th century opinion and of the history of a figure many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, this is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognised person, representing one side of the divided.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be marked and honored."
A pig-killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Fermer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near the cognac on the market of Liupanchui in Guajrow Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pork was prepared to inject with vaccines its pigs in 30 May 2005 in Sinin from the Province of Zinhai, China.
He is supposed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the doorway to the next brake open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the chariot with a blood vessel.
The forensics expert confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reported.
"My cousin's foot was bloodied and deformed," said cousin Wu, quoted by Guyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that the Yuan family and the market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Even though they're rare, it's been reported before about pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man suffered critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him away.
After an oregano farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a “spray”.
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... have no intention of hurting anyone.
But one should also treat them with respect," the man finishes.
The weight loss hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and spilling rains in the southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will lead to flood rains in northern Mexico and the southwest parts of the United States.
The rose includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a hurricane from Category 1, considered at 5 o'clock Sunday morning at the eastern time and is located 385 miles south of Punat Eugia, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to move north.
During that time, over the Pacific Ocean began to form a single, moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will start to push tropical moisture deep north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
During the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching singleclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, carry debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to rainfalls from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches rain, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods under rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a foot into the desert when a threat of tropical rain is coming.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and stormy winds.
The approaching synclinal will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach a precipitation of more than half an inch, which will lead to a bearable small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall.
On the late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the four corners Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations to the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
The majority of Central and East US are expected to have a warm start in October, and from southern planes to parts of the northeast are expected to control temperatures of about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above high.
Our long-term weather forecast points to high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the seductive maturity of the nominations of the Supreme Court of Breth Kavanau and Christine Blaise Ford — the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s.
During that time, political opposition continued as the networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last minutes on Friday: an agreement arranged by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, and according to which the FBI has to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judiciary Commission that she was convinced 100% that Kavanaugh was pushing her drunk and trying to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanau, in his lack of emotional testimony, is absolutely certain that such a thing has not happened.
It is likely that even more than the number of 20,4 million viewers reported from Nielsen had seen the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no directly available data on other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has a tradition of experiencing difficulties with measuring the number of people who see from their jobs.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar to that of a championship football match or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanau's appointment, is the first among all networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, reported by Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2,89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After they came out of the office of a moderate Republican with a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras filmed on Friday as they whistled at him as he tried to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes so he didn't raise his eyes from the ground that was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, I'm standing in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he is presenting the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already issued a statement before the elevator door was closed that it would be further resolved during the hearing from the committee.
The cable and broadcasting networks provided a live cover several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate's attention for voting.
Ala Flake said he would only do this if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against nominations next week, which the Democrats insist on in the opposition.
Flake was partially convinced of talks with his friend, the senator from the Democratic Party Chris Kwones.
After talking to Queens and a few senators, Fleck made his decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes for the approval of Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics in "political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack against her so-called Lady's Game Plan for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of customs fees from the United Kingdom for the EU and the opposite was "full absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal assault on Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned on second degree murder charges, police headquarters in Baton Rouge reported.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, reporting that Simms had lost his glasses during the fight.
The cops found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, reporting from the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he confessed to a fatal shooting against Wade.
His guarantee was set at $350,000 notified by the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge Justice Office published an preliminary report on Friday, indicating a gunshot wound to the head and neck as a cause of death.
The management has expressed their gratitude to the Department of Search for Refugees of the Louisiana State Police, the Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local residents for the assistance they have shown in the investigation, which has contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletic sports director Jo Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "the timely justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The tall 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Averagely during the last season, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "serious" and "in shock" after Wade died.
Wade said that “this is something that worries a person all the time. ”
Vulcan spreads ash over Mexico City
Throwed out of the volcano, Popocatepetel ash reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention centre has warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater has increased and in the last 24 hours, 183 gas and ash disposals have been registered.
The center has been monitoring multiple tremors and tremors.
Posted in social networks photos show a thin layer of dust covering the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since an earthquake with a magnetod 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalun separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protesters for independence met with the gendarme when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarme, began to resent the guardians of peace with eggs and paint powder, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that usually run from tourists.
Later in the day, there were other developments with the police, and the police resorted to their thumbs to control the situation.
For hours, supporting the independence of the groups, they cried out, "We do not forget, we forgive," until those who declared themselves to preserve the country's integrity turned back with "Spain Forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired region even a year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Separatist Catholics.
The overwhelming majority voted in favour of their vote for independence, although activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in voting sections in the region with a number of stormy clashes.
Wanting independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has the hope of Catalonia getting independence.
"Last year was one of our best times.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in stasis," the man added.
Despite an important victory, whether this and a small difference, in the regional elections in the last December, the supportive independence of Catalonia political parties has suffered difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-incarnation, or have been arrested in pending the process because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that "he's getting tense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, said he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
He argues that "my candidate for the European elections is the best way to resist the regression of democratic values and the repressions we observe by the Spanish government."
Londonderi: Arrested men after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londoners several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings announced that there were damages both on the gate and on the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was shot with an arbalette.
The goal of Menga brings Livingston's 1-0 victory over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The money in the High League of Livingston surprised the Rangers and inflicted only a second loss on Stephen Gerard in his first 18 matches as manager of the club at the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's team leveled on points with the second in the Hibernion class.
Gerard's team remains without a victory on foreign ground in the High League during this season, and next Sunday faces the leader Harts, who leaves eight points behind in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers is hosting Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston is already in a series of six games without losing in the championship, and the manager Holt still hasn't felt the taste of loss since he changed Kenny Miller's post last month.
Livingston Missed Good Opportunities Against No-Friends
Holt's team had to lead the result far before it marked the goal, and his direct style of play extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke the defense, but his blow went away, and then Alan Litgough shot by the beam after Craig Halquet put the ball back on his head.
The hosts let Rangers play the ball, knowing they could seriously make the guests from static positions.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined with each other and performed Menga, who led the ball and noted from the middle of the criminal field.
So far, Rangers ruled the ball more, but they faced the impenetrable protection of the hosts, and Porter Liam Kelly had rarely to interfere.
This game style continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
The Ranger's doorman saved Scott Pittman's foot, and a blow to Little's head passed by the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingston's penal field, however, the centers that were easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for the dupe – first after the unity between Halquet and Glenn Middleton's reserve and then on suspicion of playing with hand.
"Fenomental" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on "Tony Macaroni Arena"
It's a great game, and it's a great result for Livingston.
The team plays just great, continuing to overcome expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and the band almost didn't make any changes after returning the team to the High League, but Holt deserved much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in a great way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warle under pressure all the time.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrate some great things, but in this case they were much below these standards.
They lacked the last dog before the goal, only once managed to tear apart the protection of the hosts – this loss should wake the Rangers who are currently in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools down because of human rights problems, media freedom and Turkey's EU acceptance.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
From safety considerations, the police prevented a 25-thousand mob from gathering in front of the mosque, yet many supporters were gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom have also raised their vote, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow it in the country.
Various protests reflect the breakdown caused by one visitor, who is accepted as a hero of some German Turks, while being despised as a despot by others.
Road crash in Deptford: Collider rests after a crash with a car

The road is closed and bus lines are deviated, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Overseers are injured in a blizzard
Six prison guards were injured in a male prison riot with a high level of security, reported by the Prison Office.
The target broke out at Long Lantin Prison in Worchester at around 9:30 a.m. British time Sunday and continues.
In order to control it, special officers of the Tordano squad are called upon, who will have to deal with eight people deprived of their freedom, and the meddling itself in limited to one wing of prison.
The injured overseers suffered minor injuries to the subjects and received medical attention on site.
The Prison Service spoke the following statement: “Specially trained officials who will cope with the incident at Long Lartin Prison have been called out.
Six supervisors got medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it very clear that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals on the country.
In June, it was reported that after a prisoner attack, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police officers were called to prison to control heavy interference in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
The hurricane Rosa threatens with the lightning flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that Arizona is struck by a tropical storm, but it is very likely that it will happen early next week, while the fragile hurricane Rosa is carried through the desert of the southwest, leading with it the risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has already established posts against lightning floods Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different path over Finisk on Tuesday, and during late Monday she can bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “only ten tropical cycles have since 1950 maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was hurricaneed within 40 miles of Arizona's border."
The latest models from the National Center for hurricanes provide 2 to 4 inches rain with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rockist Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, and in individual places up to 4 inches of rainfalls are possible.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rosa may actually be a blessing as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious, part of the rain will probably be useful, as the southwest part is currently in drought.
According to the Commission for the monitoring of dry periods, the US has little over 40% of Arizona suffering from at least excessive drought, which is the second in weight category," the weather reported.com.
First, the route of hurricane Rosa leads to the land at the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
The rose, which on Sunday morning can still boast at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters over the Pacific, and therefore it is weakening.
It is therefore expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over a part of Mexico can be strong and lead to significant risk of conjugations.
"Small rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," the weather reported.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching Arizona's border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in South Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Center for the hurricanes warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and carry various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrains.
Midsamer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Summerset.
The wounded boy was discovered in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It's located in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
At night in the Radstock area, a boy was arrested 17 years old, two boys 18 years old and a 20-year-old man reported to the police in Avon and Summersett.
The cops are asking anyone who may have taken pictures of what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered from the indignity and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that rejects the corrupt and infuriating tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh was "died by the indignation and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, categorically rejected Christine Blaisey Ford's indictment of sexual assault decades ago at a time when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "Today the American people have become a witness to the intelligence, curament and qualities" of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly influenced Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, in fact I also participate," Trump continued.
"I am therefore going around and fighting to support good bids."
Trump noted that the Democrats had set up a mission "to prevent and prevent".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to CNN, one of the senior representative of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many of them were taken off the coast of giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when the coast was swept from waves up to six feet (18 feet), carried many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami came up after an earthquake with a 7.5 magnetode.
"When the threat of tsunamis rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster," the Agency's spokesman for overcoming Indonesia's BNPB said during a briefing at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The water was pulled with it by cars, trees, whole houses, defeated everything in its path," Nugroho continued and added that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people have climbed the trees and managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
Nearly 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Posted by the agency for disasters photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, broken and twisted bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosques.
The second moments continued to rock the coastal city during Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was found in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPT) came up with a statement that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damages as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the speaker added, and then added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be higher on the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, nearer to the epicenter of the poison.
He also added that "communications have been completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross on its part indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers are already heading to the affected areas.
"This is now a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticised for failing to inform the defeated Palu tsunami, although officials explained that waves arrived during the announcement.
Shared in social networks, love videos show a man upstairs on a building that screams at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the shore and affects both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed in time to verify the authenticity of the video.
Earthquake and tsunami have led to severe power failure, which has stopped communications around Palu and has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the assistance of Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities reported, but the evacuated still desperately needed food and other products of first necessity.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue operations efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the Pali evacuation centers on Sunday.
The people who died in Indonesia's tsunami are now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala managed to get safely to Palu, where they found shelter in the Brezent shelters scattered in the courtyard of their office, they went past a number of scenes of desolation, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite early work on emergency emergency rescue and recovery operations, some complain that the experience of similar situations by foreign rescue workers is prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The misery is still on the regional level," said Ulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government announces that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such status."
As the second night falls above Pallu after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and families of those still unknown continue to hope for wonders and that their loved ones have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian National Paraplannerism Team, trained two of the missing paraplanners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roo-Roo Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As seniors in the paraplannerism field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Rojo-Roo Hotel, the Paraplancism community reached, he was desperate to send messages on whatsApp to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only answer to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
Thieves raise 26 750 dollars during an ATM charge in Newport on Levi
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26,750 from Brink's employee, who loaded a ATM in Newport on Levi, became clear from a press release from Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to charge it with money, writes Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “ came near running behind the back of Brink’s employee ” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, continuing the message, but the police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
All those who have information on the identity of the suspects must contact Newport police on telephone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanier West is changing his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man, officially known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been wearing the nickname Ye and has been using it as a title for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change exaggerates his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandi.
He changes Ariana Grande's singer to the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons", the show's creator tells us.
In addition to his current professional name being cut short, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most often used word in the Bible, where it means "you" or "you" said the West earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"This is how I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Kanie, which means only one person, just Ye – which is a reflection of good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
Rapper is one of many known in his field who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences for the aliases Love and Brother Love.
One of West's previous associates, J.Z., also presented himself as an option with or without a tire and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico swears not to use the army against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn he will never use military force.
On Saturday, the president, Lopes Obrador, promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while student movements with left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and finding more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The United States must double the financing of the II development
At a time when China becomes increasingly active on the front of the development of artificial intelligence, the United States must double its research budget in this area, argues the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various US government bodies made speeches on the IE theme, although the United States generally does not have an official II strategy.
During this time China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 from innovation in II until 2030.
"The double budget for the development of II will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make next breakthroughs in relation to II," Li argues.
Double funding can also double the chances of the next big achievement in the II field coming from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “Superiors of II: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houdon Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the biggest EI companies in China – Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellan Lee University worked on an I.I. system that beat the most successful suit player in America, then was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee owes the debt to the previous technologies of the federal government, for example the robotics contest of the Agency for Advanced Research Projects on Defence, and asked when the next one would be, which would be helpful to identify new visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government funding," said Lee.
"Not China takes away academic leaders, but corporations," the man argues.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented university lights to work on I.I.
Lee further argues that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its I.I. program.
"I think doctors in I.I. sciences should automatically offer green cards," the man said.
The State Council of the United States announced its plan to develop artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organisations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li says.
Earlier this year, the Ministry of Defence of the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners in the industry and academic environments, and from the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSFs are concerned, they are currently investing more than $100 million annually in the development of IIs.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislator, who wanted to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change their country's name
Citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the name of the state should change to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This is a move that would have resolved the ongoing dispute with Greece for decades, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity, thus imposing veto on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President George Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a boycotting campaign casts a shadow of doubt whether the referendum would succeed in reaching the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The issue of the newsletters reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formations following the breakup of Yugoslavia by Macedonia in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came here to give my vote on the future of the country, for young Macedonians to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old Skopje citizen.
Although the referendum does not have a binding power, enough parliament members have decided that they will comply with the result of it to such a extent that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of parliamentary representatives must therefore vote.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities were reported until 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the urns.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjoose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in Macedonia's referendum to change the name of the country, which will find the way for NATO and the European Union to join Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene on 54 and arranged chairs at tents in the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us because more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after she cast her own vote.
The statesman also said that the positive result would lead to "confirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results of a study, according to which between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the necessary activity.
Another study, a work by Macedonian TV Telma, announced that 57% of the responders plan to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, it will be the first serious blow against pro-Western government policy since it won power last May.
Watch out: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton and marks the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brayton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday on the Ethyhad Steidium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal play in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalmaster was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outruns three defenders from Brighton before stopping with the ball in the empty space forward.
Then Aguero ended up surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest of him on the border of Brighton's criminal force field.
Then he went left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with his right leg crossed the doorway of Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions in his legs," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We planned to play it about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky he scored naked at this very moment."
But Sterling was the one who provided the original release of “the heavens” in this game from the High League of England.
He signed up in 29 minutes.
In the goal situation, Aguero got a deep pass in half of Brighton.
He immediately released an excerpt of the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Dream advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a dog on the far beam.
The attacker of “heavenlyness ” was able to detect closeness, just before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a match from the Championship League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Necar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play for Rockies' fate
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is no special purpose for another game of the title starting pitcher.
And yet always the ambitious Scherzer hopes to be the holder on Sundays against Colorado Rockies, if the match is relevant to the Rockies, who lead with one match in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the classing of the NL West.
Rockies guaranteed at least to participate in the Wild Card game after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still uncertain that they will win their first title in the division.
"Despite not fighting for anything ourselves, we want to finish the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss a match like that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it is believed they will allow Schercer to participate if the game is decisive.
For Scherzer, this would be the 34th match as a starting pitcher this year, and he was training on Thursday and would have the normal time to rest until Sunday.
The right-hand pitcher of Washington has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strategists in 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The president has been referring to the situation with his constituent for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanau, as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that although I am not a candidate, I am really taking part, that is why I am fighting with all the forces for the right bids," Trump said.
Then he continued with “All of you see this terrible, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourself are witnesses of their iniquities, of wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to run over to get into power and governance because they're only interested in power and governance, but we won't give them any."
The Democrats, according to the president, have set their goal "to prevent and hinder".
"The one we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the Democrats "heaven, gross, sneaky and unfaithful".
The president recalled the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein's name, which has caused strong noises from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I've been waiting -- that was really bad georgeism -- maybe the worst I've ever seen."
The Leiberists are no longer wide open.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly
When Momentum activists at my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I'm just the last member of parliament from the Leiberists to whom he was told that he was not welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received such a attitude, as she decisively faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironicly similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement during the previous leaders.
The notice of the meeting of the Leyberists from Nottingham East said on Friday that “we would like the meetings to include all and be beneficial. ”
In most of my eight years as a local representative of the Leiberists in parliament, Friday's meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of a "lighter and measured" policy have long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated at the Labour Party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of how much the party’s leadership liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues I had previously worked for felt that they shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a reverse turn and to take positions that I would never agree with – whether on the national security or the single EU market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I actually say – there is a whole insecure burden on social networks where it is called for response, rejection of moderate politics, applications that it does not belong to the Leyberists.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
In the interest of truth, I know that I even got more happiness from some of my colleagues, because the comments about me are at least political.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of those colleagues who face sexist or racist bribes every day without fearing them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Leyberists should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide open, with every sign of mistrust or change of the rules of choice becoming more and more narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many counsel to be quiet, not to talk so much, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Leiberists 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thatcher's government, which, through neglect, led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local adviser or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported Friday's proposal, I would like to say that when the state is headed towards Brexzitis, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and my energy loyally to the head of the Leiberists.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Leyberists or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threats of response or political extermination will refuse me to act in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air led to the classification
The two late essays may have changed a slight final score, but there's no doubt that Eyre deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game of Tennent's High League.
The team is already in charge of classification, and the only one of the ten teams is out of losses by now.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the match, from which Coach Peter Merchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because other teams have tested us quite seriously in past matches, but we are still without loss," Merci noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Eyre really took advantage of their positions better than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's essay on the 14th minute followed by a successful additional blow to Frazier Klimo, took the Air forward as a result, but a yellow card for Scotland's national Rory Hughes, released to play in the game by Worers, allowed Melrose to recover the result after Jason Baggot realized an essay followed by a failed additional blow.
The climate increased the advantage of Eyre from a penalty strike just before the halftime, noting an essay after a solo action, and then making the extra blow, making the result 17-5 for Air on vacation.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to the Bag, reduced the lead to only five points.
Following the lengthy stop of the game due to the severe contusion of Ruarid Not, which was taken out on the stretcher, and after the renewal of the Eyre match increased their advance after the Staford McDowal essay and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
Then the acting captain of Air Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting strong pressure and performing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after he knocked down the Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal playing Macferson realized an essay with the help of Eyre's advanced offensive line.
The climate realized the extra blow, not after long did it again after Kyle Row caught the kicked-out ball of David Armstrong and took out Gregor Henry's wing on the flag for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Star of Still Game seems to be heading towards a new career in the restaurant business
The Star of Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to be heading towards a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered to be appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, which is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-standing comedian partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the coming ninth season would be the last for the show, looking like Kiernan's already planning his life after Craigling.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan had planned to join Glasgow's "proven restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": there is no way out of the sea of Bolivia, hoping that the court will open the way back to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are constantly patrolling the ocular with a sea headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag hanging over public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are hooked with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by law.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all of Bolivia, which does not have access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit, passed over to Chile after a bloody 19th century conflict, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope has been the strongest for decades now, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the international court on October 1st, after it has already been five years in consideration.
"The force is in Bolivia, there is clearness and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the judgment of the international court of the big screen across the country, hoping that The Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivian sovereign access to the ocean.
Here's Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to head for a disputed re-election battle next year, also invested a lot of judgment on Monday's court.
"We are very close to getting our access to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the court's likelihood of making a decision in favour of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it judges in its favor, it would not change things in reality.
In the Netherlands, the UN body has no authority to take over Chile's territory and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the latest arguments states that the case is "not complex", recalls Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean has been derailed by the current government of Bolivia," Zarat said.
Then he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric had wiped out, and Chile's little will remained good.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after a normal dialogue occurs.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him on Monday, Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political duck".
"The disease will never give up its right to come out to the Pacific," he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome past problems."
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, says that his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if he is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of re-launching the unprecedented diplomacy on the nuclear issue for more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un of North Korea.
Ree called "empty hope" the idea that continuing the sanctions and objections of the United States for a declaration to end the Korean war would cause the North to fall to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration, without kyna making a significant gesture on the path of disarmament first.
Both Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Korea they are serious about their refusal from the arsenal in which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Korea next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion show in Paris reveals the last scream of massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun's rays, you don't need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which laughed the fashion floor during the Fashion Week in Paris.
I caused a lot of impractical hats in Instagram during the summer, with designers sending eye-to-eyes to their creations to rock the fashion community.
Valentino's prominent proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a similar wide periphery, which literally swallowed the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included ornaments with jewelry dunes, magic hats and even pineapples – but they have no intention of keeping warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of the higher fashion than of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs looked like a diving equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while another looked like melted fenic ice cream.
If you're into these fashion trends, you're lucky.
Modern specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats came shortly after "La Bomb" – the straw hat with a two-foot peripheral which was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Rataykovsky.
The cult to the extremely impractical hat, which took over social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion floor – a straw beach bag, almost as large as wearing it with a swimsuit.
The shelf of a refinery with the color of a burnt orange, with roofs of a refinery and riveted with a handle of white skin, was attracting all the views of the item in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Week of fashion in Paris.
Celebrating the celebrities Luke Armitid said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – once the designer has made such a great impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for wholesale accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) seek to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector, which can make up and bring about a personal training programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in an understanding language, your words are able to reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved high A.
The data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of students achieved A in Chinese, with the same assessment being 72% of the German, 69% of the French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
At the moment, languages as the subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (scienceal, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) in both the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Labour Committee showed that for reasons of the employers' difficulties in finding employees, 17% have shown insufficient language competences.
As a result, the increasing rule of foreign languages has become mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which makes these skills material to a globalized world.
Despite his chosen career, if a person has mastered a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having ruled such a skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages of a person's breasts ahead of competition.
According to a study by YouGov among more than 4000 full-time citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013 75% did not rule a foreign language well enough to be able to conduct a language, with the French being the only language that has reached a two-digit percentage with a 15% indicator.
Therefore, investment in language learning today is important for children now.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in the future plan for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future hides.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country that needs to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered as "International Communication Skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, of young people in Scotland.
I'll fatten the faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego
The wait almost ended for the fans who were eager to see LeBron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the first match of the pre-season preparation team against Denver Nugets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's gonna play in a fight.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," said Shagish Walton through Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Traydell announced in Tweeter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the sixth match of Lakers' pre-season preparation.
"I do not need pre-season matches at this stage of my career to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election rallyings tonight at Wyling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five-planned rallys, which include celebrity stops, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmatory vote for his choice to fill the seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans are threatened with the loss of control over Congress when the votes are submitted in November.
What time will Trump's rally to West Virginia be held tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19pm, east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider hearings this week for nominations for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh, in which there has been tension over allegations of immoral sexual activity, which retains the Senate's confirmatory vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation is under way.
The main objective of this series of rallyings, however, is to help Republicans raise momentum for the November elections.
That is why President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallys in the next week aim to "activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for his programme that the president will visit as many countries as possible and we start a campaign season full of commitments," Reuters told a spokesman for Trump's campaign, which refuses to be mentioned.
The rally tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wyling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
The second visit to Trump will be held this month in West Virginia – the state in which it won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morris, who is lagging behind in sociological studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morris that the president has come to give him a boost in the sociological studies," said Simon Heather, a politician from the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
“Rider Cup” 2018: The United States Team will fight for the last time by keeping your hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue of the "Foursum" games on Sunday afternoon, they might have brought what the "Rider Bath" needed.
The change of advantage in sport is a rather subjective concept in which players believe in unreserved, even more in competitions like this.
So which team is in a better position right now?
"They led six points, and now they're only four, so I guess we got a little bit of momentum," Jordan Spite said at the end of today's racing day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points in just twelve more for distribution.
As Spite says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans shouldn't lose hope if we have to judge on the sports form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speight shows an excellent form from the beginning to the end of every hole and is the real leader of his team.
Fans' encouraging attitudes grew stronger as he progressed in a round, in which with a precise impact he leveled the score in the fourth game, having together with Thomas left two strikes behind after the first two holes.
His coup, which won them the match on the 15th hole, was met with strong-tempered reactions that make us believe that not everything was lost to the American team.
"The important thing is not to think of anything else and focus on your own game," Spite said.
That's all those players are left with right now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but fascinating couple from Europe won four out of four, and it seems they're getting it all.
Molywood was the only couple that didn't do "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "godgeta" on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These consecutive successes, as well as the way it seemed to pass energy between them and the enthusiastic fans, have confirmed that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair of Fleetwood and Molinari, which will bring the potential victory of Europe as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
The stories of European fame, however, turned out to be a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the football matches from the morning while he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "belts" to the first nine holes put a spanish and Swedish into problems that they failed to cope with.
But in Sunday's games, there's no way anyone could solve your problems.
The "Fourball" and "Foursum" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips that exchange between each other, and the way a strategy can endure changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better teamwork, and that's why they gained considerable lead before the last day, but this session of "Foursum" matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were highly doubtful.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the United States 10-6 after playing the football and Foursom games on Saturday.
The inspirational duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the invincible Tiger Woods, with which their role in the Le Golf National competition increased to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy that lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bourne's European team dominated the morning football matches against Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the 3-1 win series.
The United States had more resistance to the "Foursom" matches, where they won two wins, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furik's team needs 8 points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first newlywed in Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after this sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
Once Woods and Patrick Reed were unaccompanied in the football matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat the crashes of Woods and the American rookie, Brayson Decambo, with an even more categorical score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely went through his two matches on Saturdays, just from time to time demonstrated the flashes of his genius, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 matches in "Fourball" and "Foursum" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning football matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "Foursum" clashes in winning 2 & 1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Popka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
Europe's team, however, failed to enjoy a fully pleasant, cool and cloudy day south of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas restored the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2§1 victory against the Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the football matches, and later they returned to defeat Polter and Rory McElroy with 4&3 in the “Foursum” meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team has happened to catch four points of deficit before the singles, and, according to the regulation, Furik's team will keep the trophy even in equality.
However, after being overplayed in two consecutive days, it seems their chances of turning on Sunday are not particularly great.
North Korea says that “there is no way ” to disarm unilaterally, without trust
The North Korean foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continuing sanctions have deepened the mistrust of the United States and there is no way the country will give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organisation Ri Young-how, it said that "significant measures of good will" were taken in the last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear testing facility and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"Despite this, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances will there be any way that we can first disarm each other unilaterally."
While Ri expressed North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance against a "mighty" nuclear weapon approach, where North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as he had done in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first US President-in-Office meeting and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work for "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump assured security of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking an official end to the Korean War since 1950-1953, but the United States says that Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for the relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"Now they insist "to remove the nuclear weapons first" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The understanding that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Rie did not mention whether it was planning a second meeting between Kim and Trump, for which the US leader stressed during the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Je-In in the last five months and added: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the United States, the removal of the nuclear weapons of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stasis.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States was inevitable after "the evil president" Trump called Kim a "man-raceta" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump, which last year threatened North Korea with a "full destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said a lot of work is still ahead and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Korea for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until full, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament is complete."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop financing the nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme of Korea.
Pompeo met with Ri at the towers of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Korea again next month to prepare a second summit meeting.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Korea in July with the words that progress had been made, but only after a few hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took "the appropriate measures".
According to Kim, he said that "the appropriate measures" he seeks are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture for learning “all night” with caffeine.
The lecturer found that students at university number one in the world often don't even think about when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaisler, a sleep medical professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a women's hospital, prepared the course he believes to be the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effects of sleep devoid of learning.
“At last a girl came to me and said, ‘Why do they say this to me right now, in my last year?’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first held this year, explains to students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barriera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health services, said the university decided to set the course after students found themselves suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in the dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
In another part of the participants, it is said that long-term sleep depletion can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the map of the interactive icon campus encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change students' behaviour.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," said Professor Kaiser.
The culture of pride from "teaching all night" still exists, he said, and added that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling up, as sleep deprives the brain into a hunger regime, which keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaisler prepare the course, taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says that his course “opened his eyes ” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete such a school programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends that the students consider setting up the alarm for bed and waking up and knowing the harmful effects of “blue light” broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting, which may upset the circulatory rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga broke down Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerard's lifeless team and won 1-0 for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory as a guest of triumph in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only suffered the second defeat of Gerard in his 18th match as a manager who left his team with eight points less than the torn-off team of Harts, leader of the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga marked seven minutes before the break, and what was devoid of the constructive ideas of the Rangers team at no time looked close to the equation.
After the game, the Rangers took off in sixth place, and Livingston is now third, leaving the second Hibernian only on a naked scale.
For Rangers there may be additional problems, as Foreign Judge Calum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was obviously thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that blew up Eyre in the Scots League Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same one-seater of Livingston, who pulled out a point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team pared all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers could have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They had to mark back in the second minute that Menga performed a touch by Scott Pittman against the doorman Alan McGregor, but the half-protector missed a good opportunity.
Later on, Keegan Jacobs' focus on foul play found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, turned the ball away from the back beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but they failed to create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there had to be a hole in the 15th minute when he confronted Steven Lawles, but Stephen Thompson's report rejected the Colombian claim.
Rangers only took two precise hits in the first half, but the former porter from Ibrox Liam Kelly dealt easily with Lasanna Culibali's head and the weak shot at these Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34th minute hit was surprising in view of the possession of the ball, it was completely deserved.
Rangers again failed to cope with the deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard responded to the break by changing Culibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when the wing passed on to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly turned out decisively and blocked the impact.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in the comfortable style of the game, while Litgou and Halquet constantly pulled forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor was able to handle Jacobs' blow, and with the next diver Litgou shot his head off by the beam.
Entered as Glenn Middleton's reserve from the Rangers asked for a double at the end of the fight after a single-arm with Jacobs, but Thompson never saw anything wrong in the situation again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Page by our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BRONE... the day in which future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method of detecting and measuring the radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
The cornerstone in science since then, the Geiger counter has also turned into a cornerstone of pop culture when the film "Kabanas of Coronado" was released in 1950, in which the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms separated from the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he cares right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and the modification of them to the laboratory.
Then they can “see” protein, which is common for many types of cancer and are injected again in the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who trained the immune system to identify foreign cells, saw her ovaries' cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “see” protein for many types of cancer called HER2 and then inject again in the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Oncology Institute of the United States in Betezda, Maryland: "The results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and to ‘training’ how to direct cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's make America great again", in his participation in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was called into the studio during Saturday Night Live after making senseless performance, in which US President Donald Trump praised and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America great again", he declared against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people, and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission for sexual abuse complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not exorcised, the recording of West's performance was uploaded into social networks by Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained in front of the audience that he had problems behind the towers because of his hat.
"I was put behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I'm being bullied!
And then they claim that I am on a sinking ship," he said according to Washington Examiner.
The West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship?” claiming that they will put on Superman’s suit, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
Comments caused at least twice the noises from the audience and members of the SNL team seemed ashamed, Variety said, saying, "The whole studio was silent."
West was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper MacMiller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the song 'I Love It', dressed as a bottle of 'Perier'.
West received the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest: Thank you for standing up against the crowd.”
The lead of the current show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "beautiful and that's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (as I buy music or his clothing or support his "experience"), who I think welcomes and distributes an ideology that is worthy of society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, and now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's example, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dog, was named Snoop Lyon, and the musical legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
An attempted murder charge after stabbing a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the magistrate's court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
The star of "Irran A Trons" Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of the waving John Snow sword in the full of violence medieval fantasy series of NGOs "The Game of Trons".
But the actor, who is 31, declared himself against the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be “serious ” in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that “something had gone wrong” and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #Metoo.
Kit, who soon married his partner from Rose Leslie's "Trons Game" also on 31st, admits that he feels "convinced" that this problem should be solved.
"I am personally convinced at the moment – what have we confused about manhood?" he said.
"What do we learn about the growing men in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is being taught?
What does TV and street teach that drives boys feel like they have to turn into this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something's messed up for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not take part in the history or extensions of the Game of Trons after the end of the series next summer, arguing that he had "end with the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will play a part in the recovery of Sam Shepherd's Real West, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
Soon, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in the "Tron Game".
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl where Keith John Snow's hero falls in love with a fantasy show, the winner of the Amy Prize.
They both married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump to the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820 000 people are affected.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which notes a change compared to the past.
HIV is rapidly distributed in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way is almost zero, China health services said at a conference in the province of Junnan.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities was widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men are eventually married to women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to incorrect protection in these situations.
In 2003, the government of China promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies running out of senators from the Republican Party, condemning "the dangerous lies" and "the theories of the conspiracy"
On Saturday, US Representative Maxine Waters' chamber member sentenced the charges that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from Republicans on the pages of the Wikipedia legislators.
The Democratic of Los Angeles said the allegations were made by experts and websites of the "ultra right wing".
" Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes home addresses and the phone numbers of state senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on charges of immoral sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavanau.
The run-off was carried out after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of publications is connected to Waters' office, and has released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraud and false claims – is in no way responsible for the expiry of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and it's an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly caused criticism online, including by former White House Secretary Ari Fleisher.
“In this denial there is misery, ” wrote Fleisher.
"This suggests that it does not have the temperature suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't get angry.
You don't have to act challenging.
I don't have to question the prosecution's motives.
It must be calm and balanced."
Fleisher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism by Judge Cavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused of critics that he also appeared angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the place of Waters in the mid-term elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
“In fact, if true, ” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had taken over the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraud claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Johnny English's New Year's Eve bursts again – the weak spy parody with Roon Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new film with British participation, and it seems that this also applies to the restoration of the action-commediation, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English returns".
Will self-smileing and mummies, who say how obvious it is that we are stupid, turn into a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with its eyes entrenched and “gumeno” has the permission to renew things for a second time – his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a large comic creation designed for fans of cinema who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering flash, owns little of Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean and a large part of the person who contributed with a note on the musical theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, it was initially based on the leaving chaos behind by a traveller and an international man, whom Atkinson plays in the already forgotten TV ads of Barclay.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there's either two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, carrying in a medieval armor, and for a while, the feathers rolled into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely surplus, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, but Johnny English's insane accidents are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's play does not remind him of Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked into the British super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the duty officer - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a bloated and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Tereza-Mei role, but there is nothing to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisors are informing her that she needs to call a retired agent, as all existing agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a chic center who, however, illegally teaches lessons about how to be a covert agent: there are some good hits here when English is creating a spy rock academy.
English has been called to Whitehall for emergency instructions and is reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, married to a submarine commander, a happy role in which Vicki Pepperdin's talent has been wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ophelia Buleta, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the wicked Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their own landscape by farces: dressed as waiters, lit up French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of Walt; and English causes real anarchy when trying to use the helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the House of Walt.
All smiles are certainly taken by the previous film, but since so sweet and lush, there are a lot more content here for children.
It's quite a mediocre production.
Just like in other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Leiberists deny that they're developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin is considering a radical plan for the British to work four weeks, but to get paid for five.
The party claims that it wants the company's bosses to provide the economies made by the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants the workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "past" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country in favour of workers.
Switching to a four-day working week is approved by the Congress of the Union as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A higher source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that before the end of the year a policy review will be reported.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an effort that is entered in the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day work week during its joint election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this quest does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
Leyberists spokeswoman said, "The four-day working week is not in the party's policy.
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used the Leiberists conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "the faceless directors" and "the speculators" of the utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current owners of shares in the water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Leyberist Government could impose "resistances" on the basis of the observed infringements.
In addition, he confirmed plans to introduce workers on board companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10% of the net capital of private employees who can collect annual dividends to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak before "60 minutes" whether Cavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bret Kavano has delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court with at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could make some of the Republican party's senators withdraw their support.
In an interview issued on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelli asked the senators from the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more exposed than his South Carolina colleague.
"I want to say, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after that claim came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Cavanaugh and in order to change that, it is a need for a shakedown charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it firmly," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasie Ford.
"And no one she mentioned, but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and does it even help to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens festival, a year-long musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: the elimination of poverty around the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the festival of Global Citizens will gather tens of thousands of people on the Great Morava in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi Bi and Sean Mendes, but will also know the real purpose of the event – the removal of extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizens Festival is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively struggling with it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as a voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, calling on a phone or connecting in another way in order to help increase awareness of their objective of poverty elimination.
But how successful is the Global Citizens 12 years before reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be convinced to require action or is it simply another case of so-called “cliticism” – people think they do something significant when signing an online petition or sending a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has recorded more than 19 million "acts" from their supporters who insist on a number of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages arising from its actions as having already been paid or collected at least 10 billion dollars.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the "Food Force", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, engaged in "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help stop malnutrition in the country after more than 4700 posts in Twitter by global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition simply into a historical note," said Ambassador of the "Food Force" Tracy Ulman in front of the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken which call on Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has reported funding for a project, the "Food Force", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the PSPs on his website asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The "Global citizen" replied: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But just as with the big movement for civil rights and against apartheids before us we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Week, Sean Mendes, Cardie Bi, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers at this year's event in New York, where they will be led by Deborah-Ley Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use military forces to "block" and hinder energy exports - interior minister
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its military forces to prevent Russian energy imports into the markets, including the Middle East, reveal US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the presence of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is presented as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He aimed at comparing Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, fuel stimulation and replacement," he said, while determining Russia as "one-number ponies", with an economy dependent on the fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration is tasked with increasing the exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" "North Stream 2" pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into a hostage.
Moscow has stressed several times that the $11 billion pipeline at North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's burning opposition to the project has been dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" at the presidential candidate in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "see seriously" the presidential bid after the mid-term elections.
During the city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will take a serious look at the presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his judgment regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he "led this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Twitter post Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological study conducted on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "most likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The sociological study has shown more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's bid, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party discussed with regard to potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out PTSD to Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the entry in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through after he returns is known to other families who experience the consequences of the PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are going home with," she told the audience of a rally on Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and told his son and other veterans of the war that "they're coming back a little changed, they're rooted, they're coming back, and they're wondering if they'll get that respect, which they and their brothers in arms gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and accused of assault and domestic violence against women, he was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a non-treasurable state, according to Dan Bennett, spokeswoman of Vasila's police department.
18 States and Colombia support the challenge of new asylum policy
The 18 states and districts of Colombia support the prosecution of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims of gangsta and domestic violence.
On Friday, officials from the 18 states and the county applied for good will in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The entire name of the Greek vs Sessions claim was not revealed, which the US Civil Liberties Union passed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of his fierce gang members" abused her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
State attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which come from a number of US asylum candidates, as nations facing comprehensive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned the decision of the 2014 Immigrant Appellate Council, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian lawyer Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle," the report of good faith said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that the policy which refuses to enter immigrants is harmful to the American economy, arguing that it is more likely that they should become entrepreneurs and “to provide the necessary working hand.”
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop the provision of asylum to victims of domestic harassment and gangland violence.
"The refuge is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political belief," Sesions said in his 11 July message on politics.
The refuge never meant to ease all the problems – not even all the serious ones — that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate Rescue Efforts in Palu, While Death Cases Double During Search for Survival
The situation for the survivors is becoming more and more difficult.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more corpses.
Clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their floods.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals injured by an earthquake with a magnet of 7.5 are filled.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who had suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, was located outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open because of continued secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the violent earthquake in the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into a broken wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he came into town with his family to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blames China in "tormous" with "propaganda ad"
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page ad in the American daily for the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US propaganda press.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump called for China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of involvement in the US congress elections on November 6th.
Trump's indictment that Pecky is trying to intervene in the US congress, noted what US officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to make commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in an escalating trade war in which they equalise import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the US and China in the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in the United States like Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and formerly a longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had rebuked US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in comment in the weekly issue of Des Moines Register, "at the moment it doubles this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China took advantage of the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and press by making paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"Unlike that, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see the real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have in relation to China's troubled economic trajectory, given that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not indicate exactly who.
With Cavanaugh's rise, Republicans repel women's voters for mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend nominations for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, with regard to several sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that there will be a response, in particular, to women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions around the ceiling are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be brought back," according to Grant Raher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he was questioning whether the insistence at the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) on an investigation by the FBI would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters scandald "Noimvri is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to proceed with Cavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasie Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," a news report by Stu Rottenberg, a nonpartite political analyst.
"People say the problem is already serious; this is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among voters of women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominations, analysts suggest it may follow a response if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Cavanaugh is placed on the stand. It is about the way Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," Guy Cecile, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But the Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, a little bit further off to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the responders definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
Following Flake's insistence at the moment, the FBI is investigating Ford's claims and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate's judicial committee that Cavanaugh attacked her in an unsettled condition when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burners-Ley begins a project aimed at competing on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with the open code of Burners-Lei Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lei, it is a joke that the intention behind the Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said in terms of the exercise.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online storage of personal data” or sub.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and at the same time is all of them at the same time.
The unique in the online storage of personal data is that the user determines which information is available.
The company calls it "gives powers of personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to everyone.
At present, the company consists of Burners-Lei, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers, contracted work on the project, and a group of volunteers programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are updated completely for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lei wrote that the Inrupt mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994 Burners-Lei transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had a strong influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Although Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lei will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest, honored with the Cross of Victoria during World War I
It has been marked for 100 years in the hometown of the only English priest who has been awarded the Cross to Victoria for his participation in combat during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without knowing that he was awarded the highest military honors of Britain.
A memorial monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Van, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the monument would be discovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's medal case.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Queen "in very dense fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns."
Later, he attacked the fire line and with "unbelievable courage" led ahead before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it made me calm down."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set up a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it is "a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be provided to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead received Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night long you wait to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and you can't finally witness the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six of the main map and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the UK viewers were amazed when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after being up to the early hours, especially because of the duel.
Fen description on Twitter switch to the children's animation film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so the programme has been changed by child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa Pig", yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Koker said they would work on the planning of meetings to include UK viewers in the future.
"According to me, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"But there is six in the morning on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was governmental.
I can promise you that next time this won't happen.
We'll stick to the inclusion of five fights instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to get more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he's grown up, feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in high school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview about the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be interested in less than winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent head of the long-standing show, Kersty Young, is in hospital for a few months.
With his participation in Laverne Daley's first program, he said he felt “less” than everyone else as he grew up because“ it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys.”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of indifference and that I am different from others is actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wished to inspire “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – it was "surprised."
Daley made a marriage to Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much while you are so young” – he took part for the first time in the Olympic Games on 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, “it is hard to find someone your age who has experienced such heights and downfalls.”
They became parents in June and had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself said that "his whole peace view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 – since he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be there for me, Dad, or in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at the moment when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I had dreamed of – jumping to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no greater feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – who accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still made him nervous.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday from 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
Mykelson's lost form remains on the counter for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th match at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he doesn't want his record to be connected to failure.
Mykelson, who took part in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left at Captain Jim Furik's standoff for "mourbol" and "moursom" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure again on the US team, the five-time winner from big tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his shocks from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who, even at the top of his career, was never among the most righteous players, is not in optimal shape for the difficult Le Golf National course, where the long unequal terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the field itself isn't alarmed enough, in the ninth match Sunday, Mikelson will face the exact champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who is on team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all four games this week.
If the Americans behind with four points before the 12 games of singles, make a strong start, it may prove that the Michaelson game is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his companion, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much in both the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in two games.
I expected him to play more, but that's just how it worked out, and we believe we've made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mykelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most matches in the Ryder Cup, played on Sunday.
This can end his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Mykelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence also benefits the team that are not measured by figures.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he's a great person for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just to play."
Thomas Bourne, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great lead can soon be melted
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bourne, knows from a personal experience that the great lead, accumulated before the single games of the last day of the Ryder Bath, can easily be deleted.
The Danish debuted in the Valderrama game in 1997, when the team with Captain Svee Ballisteros led five points to the Americans, but it was almost overrun by the final rights, and was barely able to withstand the victory with 14°-13.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage of Valderrama; we had a great lead on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama we won, but very hard," Bourn said, after the team of Europe from 2018 won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10-6 of Le Golf National:
So history has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All the time I've been saying that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are one of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied by the presentation of players at a difficult golf course, Bourne added: “I would never rush off with celebrations.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come out in advance, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test your entire capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to get to the players: tomorrow you have to do the best you can.
You can now turn your back on your partner, as he must also be given to the end."
Unlike Bourne, the captain of rival Jim Furik will ask his players to introduce themselves more individually than as partners, with exceptions only being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was also on both sides of these big reverses on the last day – he was part of the Brookline triumph, and then he was from the losing side when Europeans committed the Medinah miracle.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, took his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to do the same good start you saw on the Brooklyn as well as on Medinah."
When the advantage passes from one direction in the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous tension.
So we formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want to try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading our opponent and facing Rory McElroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the arrangement.
"I chose these players in this order because I think this gives us the greatest chance of success," Börn said of his selection for the singles.
Germany again postpones the release of a new warship
The latest frigate of the German fleet was to be introduced into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this would not happen until at least next year because of the irregular systems and the head-up expenditures, local media reported.
The introduction into operation of “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading ship of the brand new frigates of the class Baden-Wuertemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted the army spokesman as saying.
The floating court was to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the class Baden-Wuertemberg, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
Understandably, they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-valet missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates must be able to be used up to two years before returning to the ports of homecoming.
The constant delays, however, mean that the avant-garde military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power across the ocean – will already be old when they enter operation, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to the ship's ship after delivery.
It is little known for the reasons for returning, but the German media quoted a number of significant "soft and hardware defects" that make the military ship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software shortages are particularly important as the vessels of the class Baden-Wuertemberg will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older frigates of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it has proved that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and restricts the possibility of the naval forces to add future superstructures.
It is believed that the 7000-ton ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is twice as heavy as ships from a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including for training the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the newest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's military forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the fleet was in fact "exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem had become bigger in time since the old ships had been taken out of operation, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that no frigate from the class Baden-Wuertemberg could be included in the fleet.
The National Trust follows the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in a property in the Scottish mountains aims to find out how bats use landscapes when hunting.
Hopes are that discoveries will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats as well as brown watery nights at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places in the property to track the bats' activities during the season.
NHS officials and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will establish the frequency of bat sounds, as well as what types they issue.
Then a map of habitats and reports will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dur, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on habitat management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain have generally decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their beliefs and lead to loss of habitats.
The risk of populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, flight appliances and some chemical processing of construction materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced techniques for echolocation to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Trast has trained experts who conduct regular studies, inspection of the shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Threave property in the Dumfrice and Galluway area, which is home to eight of the ten bats in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson mansion says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a great field for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many adult trees and completed suitable habitats.
But there are still many things about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasises that it is important to check for bat presence before property maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible that the reluctant destruction of an asylum to kill up to 400 female and young bats, and to destroy the entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their beliefs.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the Bats Protection Trust, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have much to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, since we just don’t know what happens to their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations and his lawyers will sue a German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo identified the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to become famous", using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these statements.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker was charged with raping American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims to have then paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In Video in Instagram, turning to its 142 million followers, hours after publication of the 33-year-old Ronaldo's statements sworn the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news," the five-time gold ball carrier told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to accumulate popularity on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything's fine," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they call “inadmissible publication of suspicions in the field of personal life, ” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the football player would request compensation for "moral damages in size corresponding to the burden of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident in question was claimed to have occurred in June 2009 at an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football player's room where he claims to have raped her anonymously, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the Ronaldo incident, he fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" to 99 percent, but in this case he simply submitted to the "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed they were having sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "treasurable with revenge" and worried about being "not publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
During the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brekzit: UK will “regret forever” that it lost car manufacturers
The UK "will be sorry forever", if it loses its world leader status in the production of cars after Brexit, said the secretary for the business of Greg Clark.
He added that it was "comfortable" that the Toyota UK had said to BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bournaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the border delay in the Brekzit case without a deal could lead to job loss.
The plant in Bournaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – last year nearly 150 000 cars were produced, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bournaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will operate.
BMW, for example, says they'll close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main dangers of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in Brekzit's cases without a deal.
Toyota's production line works on the right time principle, and parts arrive at every 37 minutes from suppliers both from the UK and from the EU for vehicles made by order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to fill their inventory at the Darbisher factory, the company said, and therefore the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's "sharp plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only enjoy the current success, but we can also seize this opportunity," he said in programme 4's Today on BBC Radio.
"After the claims not only of Toyota, but of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
From Toyota, they cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has worked in Bournaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly worried: “I have tried to judge that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
The government spokeswoman said, "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "disputed by another week", as the candidate for Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh continues to fight, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is going to fire the deputy chief prosecutor, or not, and that way he's going to threaten Mueller's independence, he's been feeding the hearings about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that statement.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "prefer to not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate's legal committee, which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of complaints against Cavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may be this week, too, but seeing all other things happening in the Supreme Court, I believe it may be delayed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The head of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that rare press conferences are not because of animosity to the "demonstration behavior" of television journalists, although he said: "I can't say I agree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president held more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she added, adding, without quoting evidence: "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you're witnesses to practice it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting seniors.
The independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and momentarily strange behavior before fellow journalists.
Health Minister addressed EU workers in Scotland's National Health Service as regards fears related to Brekzit
The Health Minister addressed EU personnel working in Scotland's National Health Service in writing to express the appreciation of the state and their desire to remain in place after Brekzit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter leaving less than six months until the release of Britain from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter to Mrs Freeman, he wrote: “In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected during this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
I would therefore like to recall how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
EU-wide colleagues and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home, and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he got head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers' Linebacker, Christian Abercrombi, has had an emergency operation after he received head trauma during a meeting Saturday, when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State Senior Coach Rod Reed shared with reporters that the trauma happened just before halftime.
"He went to the side line and somehow he just fell there," Reid said.
Trainers and medics gave Abercrombi oxygen to the side line before it was placed on the stretcher and taken to the dressing room for additional examination.
Tennessee State's official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV at Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had exited an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/serious nature of the trauma yet", and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-grader with a college scholarship, is the first season in Tennessee State since his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher arms order in the purchase of real estate in the UK
Under the new plans of conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher arms order in the purchase of real estate in the UK, with additional resources being helped by the homeless.
This move will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the bracelet account will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The state hasna expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds per year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will today announce the decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms order in the purchase of real estate in Britain, and additional revenues will help homeless people.
On this move, it will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible housing and targeting people with high income.
The rise in the grab account will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional revenues will help the government to limit the number of people who sleep on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the present greb account, including higher levels introduced two years ago for secondary housing and property purchased for the purpose of surrender – may amount to up to three percent.
The state hazna expects the proceeds to rise by up to 120 million British pounds per year.
About 13 percent of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “preserved cities”, due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the grbove account to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property by stealing land, but did not use it, and asked Mrs. May to abandon the allowances for affordable housing to fix the "warning with houses" of Britain.
Mr Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rent control and the end of "no guilt".
He also wishes to provide advice to greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “I shared last year that I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not proper for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy as easy housing as the hardworking people of Britain.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the discouragement of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the team of Scotland ”
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish took the challenge of bringing the club back to the northeastern England, which is currently in third position in the First League, three points from the first place.
He went to the State of Light this summer after last season he took St. Miren back to the Scottish Supreme League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a game for the B team and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsund.
"But I grew up with the games of Scotland at Hampton, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This opportunity, however, would only be opened if I were successful at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers are names such as Dick Advocate, David Moses, Sam Allerdaise, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Cannon.
A former teacher of Alo Atletik said he had no anxiety as the successor of such established names at a similar famous club, and previously he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant in Dumberton and 15 months at Harts' coaching headquarters.
Then he helped Halo not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miron from a falling team to a winner at the Chempynship in the next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a football player in Clyde, Hartlipul, Folkark, St. Miren and Hamilton Academymill.
"I was really on the crossroad," he remembers about the time he took Aloa.
"I really believed being a manager was the best place for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same stress and stress levels at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I really do, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin my whole conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals the study
Summer heat increased the revenues of the fighting to survive British pubs, but gained more tension for the chain restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but the revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the Business-Consultant CGA, who composed statistics, said: “Due to the prolonged solar time and longer since the expected participation of England in the World Cup, a similar model was followed in July as in June when the pubs reported growth of 2.8 percent, but the restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The decline of 1.8% in the restaurant business in June was only deepened in July.
The pubs and drinking bars reported the best results in their height compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The feeding rooms also suffered from solar weather, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars, the sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month while there was a 3% reduction in food."
Paul Newman, from leisure analysts and RSM entertainment, said: “These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although a decrease in sales by 4.8 percent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for the managers of the food establishments and only time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring so the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the delay in the deployment of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the region of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a solid indicator in the industry.
One of five children hides from his parents a secret profile in a social network
One of five children — some only at 11 — has a secret profile in a social network that hides from his parents and teachers revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
News raises fears of sexual content material being published
Twenty percent of students say that they have a "basic" profile that shows their parents
One of five children – some 11 - creates a social network profile that keeps it a secret from adults.
Study among 20,000 high school students shows a growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has increased fears that materials with sexual content are being published.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a clean "basic" profile that shows their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager child, who encouraged others to "bring him down".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Alyd Doyle will be the "athletes' voice" in the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Alyd Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions of the annual joint meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most accomplished minor, and President Ian Beaty has identified this move as a great opportunity for those who lead to sports, to take advantage of its rich experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilide is looking forward to a great deal of respect in Scotland, Britain and the world's minor communities, and we are convinced that light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her attraction," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I have a desire to be the voice of athletes, and I really hope that I can contribute and help promote sports in Scotland."
The American who won the finals at 200 and 400 meters of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator in BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got hit a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether I would recover to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I've achieved a full recovery, I've learned to go again, and today I'm training for mobility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A milk pump advertising that compares mothers with cows, separates online opinions
The company producing breast milk pumps divided the online comments by an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows that are breastfeeding.
In order to note the placing on the market of the expected ‘first milk pump in the world suitable for wearing’, the company for consumer technology Elvie released a joke musical-video advert to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to the infants to declare themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's horde, full of hay, on the background of a song with a song, including, "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tail," and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a udder, it's my breasts."
The song continues: “Trust, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, suck your friends. ”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it defames the “dangerous” of the dairy industry.
‘A lot of a stupid solution is to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," wrote someone.
The milk pump Elvie is collected discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast-feeding pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: “So inadequate advertising. ”
Others protected the advertising, while one woman admitted that she thought the song was “absolutely fun. ”
"According to me, the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still nursing.
Squeezing made me feel exactly like a cow.
Well, it's a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny commercial aimed at mothers who are squirming (often in their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like ‘ cows’.
It's not an ad thanking or condemning dairy processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the group of women discover that they were dancing with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who are breastfeeding feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely insane, has no wires or pipes, and gathers discreetly in a nursing bra that gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go outside while they drain.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director in Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative placing on the market.
With the drawing of parallels between infants and dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on breast-feeding and all the challenges related to this, while at the same time showing the amazing sense of freedom that will bring about the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump falls into the lead news.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium for designer Martha Jakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children are secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because sharp rhetoric and politics by Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who fear that they are risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults of the family should provide fingerprints, and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior employee at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
‘Near 80 percent of those who are either guardians or are members of the family of the guardians reside illegally in the country, and many of them are foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue these people," Albens said.
In their quest to cope faster with the registration of these children, authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to officials at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those identified as inappropriate to allow will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely it is to become suppressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to officials at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern increases in large facilities, such as that in Tornillo, where the signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the “palatical city ” without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends may make the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria insists US "occupied troops" France, Turkey immediately withdraw
Addressing UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops reside illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and "to which appropriate actions will be taken".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terror is almost at its end" in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions are violently displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleared" by both terrorist organisations and by "every illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who are mainly training and counseling both Kurdish parts and Syrians, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands of the devastated country.
With regard to the refugees, Mualem said that conditions are bearable and can be returned, accusing "some Western states that they are "extreme insolent fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue, which is an entirely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be provided for the recovery of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war is reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major fortress of rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would be directed towards jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-related al-Qaeda front "Al Nusra" that "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draw up a draft of Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem exposed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee by saying that the panel's work should be limited to "the review of members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump to win second term
According to this logic Trump will win reelection in 2020, unless – as many liberal viewers probably hope – his presidency will not be suspended prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
That would no doubt be "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
There are no signs of the audience's fatigue at the moment.
From 2014 pymtam rating increased double to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the fair, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of cable television ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers at dinners with big news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC drama "The Last Candidate", where he is told of the secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack against the Capitol.
Nell Skoval, who is the veteran-screener of comedy and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a cab in Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her cab driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked “Why? ”
Mrs. Skovel told me that he said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that shows up on television that comes out of Washington stories can determine the future of Roe vs Wade, whether the families of immigrants can reunite, as well as the good condition of the world economy.
Turnout is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the desire to be a informed citizen does not match this at six o'clock to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Strech"; Paul Manafort's flight jacket from a sketchy skin for $15,000 (the dress full of arrogance" according to "Washington Post") and the shaking descriptions of Storam Daniels about Mr Trump's anatomy.
I'll especially never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"The honor of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little bit each night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, with regard to changing participants and daily turns (eating with the National Football League, thanking Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, because you're gonna fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flace this week, he was at his side on the north bank of Kauai was sunny, 80 degrees, but he was locked up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the television, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal committee and depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember one time when we were doing all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments in the most disputed race in the early elections for a place in Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district gets a flow of money, thanks to the redecoration of the districts of Congress, and hence two holders for the same place.
The recently-divised county in Pittsburgh suburbs indicates conservative Democratic Republic of Connor Lamb, who won his post from another county in partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another holder, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th Pennsylvania district, which strongly advocates the new 17th.
The maps were re-drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old districts were counter-constitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district has set off a financial dispute between the main financing institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb reported himself in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the March 18th delinquent elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Convention Area.
The position has been occupied by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the county with 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already admitted Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of "the recent decisions not to be recognised by Taiwan anymore", Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Department said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were provided only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from America to fight drugs for development and economic assistance.
The sanctions proposed, including cutting financial aid and target visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American State with its unemployment and percentage of the killings.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves for a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior management authorities stated that their wish was to have a conference, so effectively suspended any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pens has announced that he will participate in a conference planned for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration is giving to the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. MPs returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next move may be the special adviser Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, and the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack against our elections.
If Congress' leadership changes, it will appear that Mr. Trump will have to take account of this body, just when he is ready to face the voters, and perhaps also to the jury of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not believe that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – neither is that of the likes of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to commit a coup against Hitler, as long as the West resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and failed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacre.
The course of history depends on such knots, and the unforgivable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are facing several similar knots right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this paper reported that last year he proposed to secretly register the president and speculate with the opinion that it was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the "Times" story was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or is approved for the Supreme Court despite the charges of sexual possession and false testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress, if this will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits her for a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I took a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the candles for Shabat on that table, wearing a swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior associate of the Brookings Institute, is the chairman of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the collision with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from Group G of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow half-protector Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the 2-2 level in question with the Villareal, but he believed that for the Rangers this result could turn into a tramplin to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old football player said.
"We entered the game with hope that we could win something and leave with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
We looked at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened in addition to my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the training is useful.
I hope we'll be able to exert all our strengths to forget last season and achieve the desired successes."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they wanted to receive, few people are discussing this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nacionwide study share that they discussed their husbands' costs on long-term care.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but have not taken the steps towards having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Activity Sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not tell your wishes in advance.
Along with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when selecting a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed "Life" insurance policy with monetary value to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your resources – if you have money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Fight the legal battles at the beginning.
Please appoint a health care attorney so that you have a certain trustee to oversee your medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the idea of a trustee on financial matters.
You can select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incompetent.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Display these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
"What are the medications like?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Set up a plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was home tonight.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The cops describe the shooting that took place around 2:30 British Summer Time as a "case of action".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the death to grow.
Due to the interrupted communications, support organisations cannot obtain information from the Dongala regency, an area in the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a $7.5 magnetod.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the shoreline of the island of Sulavesi.
The regency, which is less than the province’s administrative region, is with an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of central Sulavesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite bank of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been peaked several times by tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesian disaster recovery agency data.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Kunami reached the west side of Dongala in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the semi-semic “Tiocene Fire ring” and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: Strong Tress on December 26th on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatara activates a wave of tsunamis that has hit 14 countries and has destroyed 226 000 people all over the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of them are in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatara at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatara.
2006: A body with a magnetod 6.8 cut off the most populated island in Indonesia, Java, triggering a tsunami that broke into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnetode 7.6 impact near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnetod 7.5 cut one of the islands of Mentai and activated a 10-meter wave tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Paddy Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the destructions of the deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time no tsunami was activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong truses cut off the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people were killed, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in a stateless state.
Sarah Paylin's biggest son has been arrested for domestic violence charges
Trak Pailin, the biggest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Peilin, 29, from Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involved in a domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a police report in Alaska released on Saturday.
According to the police report, when known by the female sex tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Peilin has been detained in the Matt-Su pre-restraint building and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “unlearned, certainly” when asked for a pint, the media reported.
Peilin is threatened by punishment for three homages from Class A, which means that he can be deprived of his freedom for up to one year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with a Class B homage, which is fined one day in prison and a $10,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that criminal charges are filed against Peilin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in the reporting of a crime on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drug addicts in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a fist in her face.
Sarah Paylin was criticised by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress arising from his ministry in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that cut down Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The earthquake with a magnetod 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication grids have been cut off, with the number of dead people expected to grow in the near days.
The earthquake struck close to central Sulaves, northeastern of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
Social networks have videos that show the timing of the collision.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu, when the wave of tsunamis hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist assassination in New York City
Federal prosecutors from New York want a death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist assassination, in which eight people were killed – a rare death penalty that has not been committed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have used a rental truck on Home Depot to commit the assassination in October of a bike near West Side highway in lower Manhattan, gasking pedestrians and bicycles along his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" has killed eight victims and has "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, according to a notice of intent regarding the death penalty request submitted in the South District, New York.
According to the trial document, both charges can be completed with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an extended federal judicial unit went to Saipov's 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder related to a racket used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of the MPS.
The attack required "serious planning and intentional planning", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed as "dangerous, cruel and depraved".
"Sifulo Habibulaievich Saipov caused trauma, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Earli, Ernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last southern area of New York looking for a death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentences in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in New York, it was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conviction for conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov, a peoples fugitive, did not show a sense of remorse during the days and months after the assassination, according to court papers.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack after watching IDIL videos on his phone, the prosecution said.
He also asked his hospital room to place the IDIL flag, police said.
He pleads innocent to the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to seek a death sentence rather than a sentence of guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only extend the traumatic effect of these events for all those affected," Patton said.
The team for the protection of Saipov had previously asked the prosecution not to seek a death sentence.
Member of the Parliament of the conservatives says that NIJUL FARAJ must lead the negotiations on Brekzit
Nigel Farage has pledged to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at a conference of conservatives.
Former leader of the British Party of Independence said politicians should "feel pressure" – as one of Teresa May's own party members suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a member of the conservatives, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have gone out by now", if Mr. Faraz was secretary of the Brekzit issues.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May in order to address the deeply divided lines of the party was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay that joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers", despite the attacks by the Brexitis supporters, supporting staying from the EU as well.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that the Eurosceptics and the Leyberists choose between its package and chaos.
Mr. Bon told the protesters with the Vineyard "Exiting means exiting" in Salihal that he wanted to "forgo the Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Farage had to participate, of course, with the others and that he had to receive the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
The MEP from Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.
Voicing his opposition attitude towards the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be hardworking.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The understanding that the British had changed their minds and wanted to remain is completely false".
conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped to be elected.
Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: “The Prime Ministers keep their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel pressure", if they intend to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change to Brexit and we're gathered here today to say, "We won't let you get away with this."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to get our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexitis, to feel pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has helped us win in Brekzit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-ruleing, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters went on a journey through Birmingham before conducting a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists were raised flags with inscriptions "Conservators vs. Brekzit", after the group was launched this weekend.
Leyberist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives about the problems with the security of the party's application when he found himself at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all of Canada's technology and more, and also, for the uninterrupted crossing of borders for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brekzit," he added.
Warren says he'll "think seriously" his presidential bid
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "think seriously the opportunity to run for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke of her future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will be running for re-election in November against the state representative of Republicans Jeff Dile, who was the joint chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the heart of speculation that it can take a post at Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holioke was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayoral building following Trump's entry into office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it's high time that "women go to Washington and fix our injured government, and that includes women at the top."
He was arrested for the death of Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was an arrest suspect in the shooting Friday, when basketball player Wade Simms of LSU was killed.
Baton Rouge's police department reported Dayton Simpson's arrest, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 east.
They posted a video from Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man who sees the footage.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Waid Simms was shot in the head, which eventually leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247ports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, had a weapon, and he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson has been arrested impenetrablely and detained in the custody of East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Youth with a height of 6′6′′, grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms participated in 32 games with 10 dates as the holder of last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 match fights.
Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's orders helped defeat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Walters Botas was first ranked by Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from Mercedes' team would play an important role in the competition.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously threatened Hamilton while protecting his position in the first two bandages, allowing Fetel to attack his partner.
Fetel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next tour and went after the Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat it after a bold maneuver and driving "guma to the tire", which forced the Ferrari's pilot with the refusal to release the inner part of the runway to avoid punishment with added time after he had already closed his opponent's way with a dangerous double protection maneuver on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstapen started from the back lines of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
Then he even ran for quite a long time since the race, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly beat Kimmy Rykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered the pit stop in the 44th lap, but failed to catch enough in the next eight laps and eventually Rykonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Walters did a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me out.
The team did an excellent job to win the first two places on the podium," Hamilton said.
It was really a bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday because of her claim that she did not spread the letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing the prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh in a sexual situation.
During a rally interview in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, but instead comment on how the Senate's events show that people are "unspeakable and disgusting and untrue".
"What can happen and the good that happens the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at editions and distributions, and they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her response... did you release the document – "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I wasn't spreading."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't spread," he added, mimicring the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's claims against Kavanaugh in July, which was distributed earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that distribution had happened from her office.
"I haven't covered up Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep my confidentiality and I kept my confidentiality as she wished."
But her denial was not well accepted by the president who commented during the rally Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continued to defend the challenge of the Supreme Court accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president stressed that the Democrats were using claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power with all possible means.
Look at the impunity, shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control," the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundy.
Dundy Stars came back for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, winning the Dundy rematch with five or three Saturdays.
Jayantes took the game early with two goals after hitting Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauni leveled for the housewives before Duyer restored Jayents' lead.
Francois Bushar leveled for Dundy before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's two goals to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for the boys of Adam Keif who got out of the bottom to beat Dundy in Belfast by 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between the opponents this season, and Giants won the previous three matches.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, and then David Ruderford doubled the advance, as he assisted Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Duyer made sure that the Giants would lead before the first vacation, marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar reunited the chances with a powerful blow to the door at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran united efforts to help Nilsen give Dundy his first lead to the match at the end of the second half, giving him his best shot at the fifth goal team in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who lost the last four matches of five meetings, welcome as hosts of Milton Keen for their next match on Friday.
Flightmaster was killed to make sure that hundreds of people on board could escape an earthquake.
Flight manager in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, guaranteeing that a plane with hundreds of passports on board managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are unknown to a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulavezi on Friday by triggering a wave of tsunamis.
Strong secondary shocks continued to hit the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the severely shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at the time, will be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided to crash.
He died in the hospital later.
Air Control spokesman Indonesia, Johannes Syrate, said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard of it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will grow as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached," said Agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry aids and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There's marines everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, President of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country's army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was cut by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people were killed.
Air Niugini reported that one person is unknown after a plane crash in lagoon
The plane that took a plane crash into the Pacific lagoon now reports that a person has been reported missing since earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that from Saturday afternoon they can't contact a male passport.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details of the passport, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline said that six passports stayed and Saturday at the hospital, all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster remains unclear and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the US Air Force said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American Bill Janes, a passport on the plane, claims that the plane was running very low.
"This is extremely good," Janes said.
Janes tells us that he and the others have managed to run through deep water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardess were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a slight head trauma.
The U.S. Air Force says that sailors repairing the docks nearby also helped rescue the ship, using an inflatable boat to get people to the shore before the plane sinks into about 30 metres of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Aviation Network indicate that during the last two decades 111 people have died on flights with aircraft registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
An analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded on the case this Saturday in the retrial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the United States Department of Justice testified hours ago as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulet said he received data on the location of several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers at the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarence Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood up to the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town this day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Roulet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis' death, he erased text messages, calls and her contact information from his phone.
"He took her away from his life," Hale said.
The defense plans to begin with its conclusions Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.

Another black man?!
A New York fan judges couple after firing for a "rastic" message
In New York City, she sues a couple for being fired for discrimination after getting a misspelled message from the mother who complains that she is the "other black man".
The couple deny being racists by likening a request for "extortion".
Linzi Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was mocked when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEE, SECOND CERNOCOSE”, wrote in a text message Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
Instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Morris twice.
After she realized her mistake, she felt "uneasy" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was an African-American, did not do her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reported New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was rewarded for a working day then sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation because of the dismissal, asking for $350 a day for the six-month contract that she was originally hired for, although she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do this," she told Post on Friday, adding "You sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racists, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable act because they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent me something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband, Joel Plasco, in front of Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended even if it were a mistake?
You're the newborn?
Imagine yourself."
Comparing a request for "extortion", Plasco claims that his wife had only been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone in this state?
This is not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the court case is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks by denying them their behaviour and logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would not feel a relationship with a talking bear, revealed a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, relates the letter: “It is hard to place yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's a lot of fun now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC before he inspired himself to write the children's book for a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about the possible rejection of the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father had secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not a self-grateful person," she said.
"But since Paddington felt so real, it is as if you had a child who has achieved something: you are proud of him, although it is not really your case.
I think he kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited the merits of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter landed, she was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
"At all times, he called to say that the situation is really bad that he does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Enon-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say that he will die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by her doctors to maintain her heart slowly stop to act and leave her system.
She's been gone a while before, and that's how it's over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get tight."
Finally, Mrs. Enan-Laperuz, who, until now, grieves for the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I was down my head, and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this all-consuming sense of compassion with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grief women put cards on to prevent suicides off the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones for suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wells cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by the smile.
They always said his smile lights up every room."
However, he gave up his job before leaving, and he was in “a dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “to make sure people know that she has someone to go to and who to talk to, even if she is a friend.
Do not keep silence. You must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he neither looked at them nor anything."
She said that this was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to cope: “This opens a void in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we have to move on and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is at stake after the FBI starts investigating
I imagined whether we could really achieve what he wanted – an investigation with a limited duration and a limited scope – perhaps we could unite our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee "was falling apart" despite the confirmed overparty blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwantedness is because of the moment itself.
The early elections are only after five weeks, on November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans are not well presented, they will seriously suffer their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the state.
George W. Bush called the senators by inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and with his help, he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI draws up his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where members are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his application for the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea “restricted” at Kim
South Korean legislators claim that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sung, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of the Union, said that last year there were 1127 fugitives, compared in 2011 they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human smugglers, are key factors.
There's no official comment on the part of Korea.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where there is the longest border with North Korea, and it passes more easily than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides both roots.
China considers refugees illegal migrants rather than refugees as often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Korea for talks focused on a standstill in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work in general for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way that we will be first unilaterally disarmed," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "isterican" and said it was not suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in Congress Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kavano "isterican" and said he was too unbalanced for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not have thought that if a woman had responded in this way, they would have called it "asterical", Pelosi said of his reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he had committed sexual involvement with Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and feeling when he was discussing family and school age.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and co-ordinated attack against the person", organised by liberals who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it has become clear that he is prejudiced to the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if he would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so - if he does not tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he is unfit not only to enter the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
At the moment Cavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Appellate Court.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she is concerned about Cavanaugh's potential claims regarding the Law on Available Health Care or the Roe vs Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, preconceived man to enter the court and expect us to say, "is it not great," Pelosi finished.
Women should also be mastered.
It's a legitimate criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinum told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I made huge assistance from a woman who was executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her co-chair, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought this was genius."
Tears are allowed in terms of anger, in part because they get the wrong way at first.
One of the clearest memories of my previous work, in the office mostly with men, is how once, while I was lurking with inexplicable rage, older than me my wife grabbed me by the door – a freezing head which I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be glad they did it to you."

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship with a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a good decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they wanted to do was show up another one.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it is included late in the campaign, it is lagging behind with fundraising and decides it will not remain in the race unless it manages to raise $2 million in US dollars.
The battle is predetermined of failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she declares that she will not continue with the official campaign, she has been swept away by so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, discontent against the system, which makes it so hard to raise money and be able to turn to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I've had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder responding to the media.
“Someone may think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were going to write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, while the battle is still gaining speed, a crackdown between the two countries will bring Beijing's benefit in the long run, say specialists.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning valve this year, betting tax-based key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase in tensions occurred this week with new duties affecting the production of $200 billion U.S. dollars (150 billion British pounds) with the effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time Beijing was reciprocating new duties with five to ten percent U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has pledged to retaliate every blow to the United States, and soon the second largest world economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to demands, but bending its head publicly in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for C.C.E., the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays his cards correctly, pressure from the trade war with the United States can help in the long term China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing can create conditions for an economic crisis in any of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have recognised before," Abigail Grace, a research associate on issues related to Asia to the expert group Center for New American Security, said.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister said
Syria said it was ready for a voluntary return of refugees and asked for assistance in restoring the country, devastated by the war, lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem stressed that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas devastated by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the state since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six more million people still living there need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in restoring the devastated state.
He stressed, however, that no conditional assistance or assistance from countries that have financed the rebels will be accepted.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the “Rider Cup” for 2018, overcoming the US team with a final score of 16.5 per 10.5 of Le Golf National in the Paris area, France.
Thus, the United States has lost six consecutive losses on European land and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bourne reached the required 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The US star Phil Michaelson, who presented himself weakly during most of the tournament, put his first blow to the 16th hole (with a pair) in the water, losing his match against France's Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari presented himself excellently in all rsts, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance of 5-0-0, since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spitt lost weight with 5&4 by the player in the team of Europe, which is the lowest in the ranking – Torbourne Olesen from Denmark.
The leader in the world ranking Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Puller of England, for which this is probably the last part of the Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, an eight-part veteran in the Ryder Cup, became the European with the most won points in the tournament for all time, thus increasing its assets to 25.5 points this year.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold on.
It's been a rough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
In everything, the team is important and I am happy that I was able to help," the excited Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He hands over to his countryman John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2 & 1 singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his overall balance of "Rider Cup" is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players for all time won 14 great titles – a indicator that only goes to Jack Niklaus.
The US team has been having difficulties all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-class golf all day long from the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furik shared after the disappointed team presentation: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pressed Europe's team.
There was a fight.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players presented themselves very well.
We'll regroup, discuss the important issues with the US Professional Golfers Association and our Committee on Ryder Cup and we'll look ahead.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can't take your opponent's hat off.
We were just outplayed."
