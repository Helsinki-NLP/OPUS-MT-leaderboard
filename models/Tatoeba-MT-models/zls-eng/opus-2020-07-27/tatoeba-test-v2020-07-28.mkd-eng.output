It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're getting a cold.
They're walking to me.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
How much is it worth?
Our water was up to our necks.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary seeing him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he knows nothing about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist attitudes in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves blew up the herd.
That song has been haunting me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
You ever shot a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
For free, get a ticket.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me. I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom's homeless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom's aware he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's got a little bump in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have resolutely answered.
I have to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spits up his gum.
I really want your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we're not made of monkeys.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Who do you usually have lunch with?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop being so mean to Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes egg ham.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather be on the subway than on a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle it?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rewinded the movie.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom, I wrote this report.
Do you buy these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
It was personal.
I'd better go too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really have pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who wants to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose runs every time I'm cold.
We've met a few times.
He didn't like the soup.
The tree's green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone's looking for happiness.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom treated me terribly in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still cost the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if he asked.
Tom is obedient, even obedient.
Where did Tom open up?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried herself.
Run!
Is it worth it for the delivery?
I want tails.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one like that, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also take checks.
Wesnikov makes one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one.
The Macedonian has four Glagolitic ways: a statement, a condition, a command and a delay.
They haven't gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her lines as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right on me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember meeting the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will the Japanese economy be next year?
That's exactly how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our court is big.
It's a children's game.
You don't mind Tom.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom drove me to hell.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must continue.
You've made a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Don't draw attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite baton.
Is this Jupiter or bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a tramp.
Who do you have on the list?
He has a very strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't like ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I come with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot of money.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was food.
Be careful not to sneak into the muddy bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fatal day they try to escape.
Everyone's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom P.D. already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a bad room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
Quietly smiled.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I gave him a slap.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do it.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The King’s talk was particularly difficult because of the severe speech defect.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried for nothing to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
He's licking himself.
When do you learn?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a familiar paragraph of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by human beings.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get hold of it right away.
Didn't you hear what I was saying?
Go for a walk.
Don't overeat yourself.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the clamp.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Well, didn't you want the reward?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
Dishonest yourself.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at this bright star.
I don't know how to help him.
Cuff yourself.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is stupid.
We've been bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you have to rebuild your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a black height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
The electric heater warms the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the treetops.
Let's forget about it for now.
Because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quick to receive data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll recap the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
His sleeve's stuck.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone's gone but him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They've been hammered by him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked him to do.
Tom by mistake told everyone I died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
My water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia really liked the concerts.
Ask them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does he care about anyone?
How is that your fault?
Tom got a beer from the bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are falling apart.
Tom got Mary to donate money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did he ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multiphase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran down the stairs.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
The mustard's really hot.
We advertise our products on television.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That's what happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30.
She'll have to leave soon enough.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked it.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would have figured it out.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom, put your hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him that he would remove nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It's kind of wrong for me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Right carito is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night.
Tom was driving around town with a raised brake without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you want a camping trip?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to shut Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, and they do not see their own conduct as undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns his son's car.
Don't make any noise.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does it matter?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used a lot of bad expressions.
Your bucket's pouring energy!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big deal for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of darkness.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom's writing skillfully.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They've got to be beating up the idea.
Tom's really pissed off.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as reprehensible.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes lit with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him about.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "I want to travel."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
He wanted to meet me, Tom.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom could be richer than we thought.
I never intended to trick you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soybean.
He apologized.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
The hard-cores, butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom took his knee.
Where do the piñoli come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't make it.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink sodas.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You're cooking turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going what he wants it to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan had five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking throats.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm feeling much better already.
I gave them one more chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm threatened.
Tom's here early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He's always doing his English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
No part of the pig failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What good is that?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't help it.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That doesn't have much priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You know what I mean?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got whatever he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
It's the first cockroach I see this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems happy.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had nausea, and she suspects she's pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and know.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix yourself.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
Unfortunately for me, Mary came to the party in a blue dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't say anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
The beekeepers remove the fruit to collect the honey.
I have to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom got his eyes lit when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
It might be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't exactly seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that riddle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he actually is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
It's not blue. It's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they're eaten by people.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I'd forgotten how smart you could be.
Can I see that?
He's spending his money. The water's all over the place.
We're not covering anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times already that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom keeps lying to me.
I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's go for a walk around the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you pushing me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels guard us and lead us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom stood at his disposal.
Tom's going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is Java.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom's the real hero.
Where did you come from?
Tom wanted him to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That worked.
These goats are naughty.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not back.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He stood before her.
There are more exits.
Tom's always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen heads.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven't found time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's getting dressed.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't have been prevented.
I'd love to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom's blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nod.
I don't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the compositions.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered in blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everybody here loves you so much, Tom.
We're going to eat cherry from Italy this afternoon.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need a sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was dissociative.
It's okay with me tonight.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The pyramids that fell off the roof have been torn apart.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are indivisible.
I helped clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
Just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You better go.
Tom's got the exit.
I've got two cameras.
What did you find?
Dan confessed to Linda that she was a heavy drunk.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game isn't over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no use to you here.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary yelling.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
Amebs are lifeless.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't mean Tom's dead.
The waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French write their word for "bubamar".
The crane can go 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you're good for?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask your expert face.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom appeared to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and dance.
It's kind of kind.
Tom erased his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
Gangsters blackmailed a large sum of money from a rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
Your conscience is biting, isn't it?
You want blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Take a scar, your nose's running.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you repent of.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely leaves.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it would rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Let alone stay.
She's got ten kids.
Tom's threatening me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still dressed in pajamas and bathrobe when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're in the back.
The sentence is not exact grammar.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that her results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree was blocking the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
No more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
He's doing his math best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were travelers.
I think Tom's vain.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can get it from her.
Get some food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
At every wedding, he wants to be the groom and at every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not the property of the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary was gonna help him.
Tom's never there.
Please, just give it away.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out a pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long do you need to drink this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Get us a face on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not write down their happiness.
I still don't know what we're supposed to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to get my own house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I teach him English.
Usually what causes the pain?
We're addicted to work.
The box is made of tin.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's evil.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
The sperm was pouring; there was a lot of sperm.
Tom's very boring.
I've been injecting myself against the flu.
Just try it.
I want to dance, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was one.
Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I want to talk to you a little bit about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We were eating turtle soup.
We can work in the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's valuables.
That cake is calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little distracted.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I'm hiding Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They tell me you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What’s not darker than her?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not wiser.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of my day here.
Should we wait here for her?
If you go out like that, you'll get cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say something, Tom?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom got hurt.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were making a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All the stores are closed.
You've been making white again!
Stop beating your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We don't need drama.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with the associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report rape.
Tom's a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow, I can't believe it yet.
What's the shortcut?
Thanks again for coming.
They're cheating on us.
The wounded soldier was barely walking.
The sun just came up.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
Tom often downloads movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light bounces away from the water.
Tom missed the soup.
I don't fuck you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police put Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
You miss something?
To sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We walked between the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd stand on Tom's side.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a gentleman.
Now we're even with him.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This is a perfect fit.
He used to use his hose to make his torch.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is that you don't give any gift to Tom.
Tom was working.
Tom lived right next door to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to learn.
He's down the stairs.
Do you want me to make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He's got a lot of debts.
She knows the major cities.
What's under the covers?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom's giving everyone a drink.
You ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom came up to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her life.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not good enough reason.
First, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pen.
Who should we start worrying about?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship sank without delay.
Did you buy the cure?
Did he drink Tom?
I don't give a shit.
The question is who's gonna do it.
I'll head to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Everybody happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissin' me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please ask me what it was.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom is a wunderkind.
He's walking to school.
It's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very obnoxious.
Now the question is, what do we have to do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
You ended up in fourth place by 56 runners.
Don't make any noise.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
You knit a wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I don't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are threatened.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's done.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We've heard it carefully so that we don't miss a word.
I already have plans this weekend.
Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better once he drinks a few beers.
You have a kind eye.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, yeah, he'll get better... when the bag gives birth to grapes.
Tom's a consultant.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when is there fireworks?
It's possible Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing you do.
I didn't betray anything.
I was just thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair's falling.
The big question for which no one has found an answer, including me, despite the thirty years of study of the female soul, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The villagers are harvesting.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the break-in?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the object?
Every split, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you out of your mind?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.
They're all up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert ended with the folk anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Hold on one second.
I've got a lot to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's just enough air here.
She married zero of a man.
Wind's shrinking.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything like this.
The old man committed before he died.
I don't like this book.
Fortunately, I blinked him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got the duds.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom took him to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol in the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm thinking.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
One who can hear butterflies laugh knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't handle them.
They pulled a crumb to see who goes first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not for you to eat like goods!
But if I had been in Brazil, I would have been more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Have you forgotten that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my hours.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have a flu, and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food cools down, heat it up in the microwave.
The path is right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
This guy's a bandit.
Maybe Tom saw him.
Tom's knocking a little bit.
Tom's very immature.
What are they up to?
How's the volume of the cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he was drinking.
I've had a good time with your company.
Tom, you have to stop.
Tom likes rematch.
Tom stabbed a fork in the pucker.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
The whales are kind of mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shaken.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, what about you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's getting ready to roll.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
You took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me, and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm really good at it.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard so much about you.
Tom may say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get cold.
What are you drinking?
How it came -- that's how it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom raised his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any new accidents.
I'd like to go too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom's untouchable.
What's your question?
Tom went for an agile.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Does Tom bother you?
This is my latest review.
I haven't been feeling well for two days.
The hose is a waste.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between mules and donkeys.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
The coming out of this rain does not come in consideration.
I'll tell them to leave right away.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an assalen.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was shooting Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of this happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushrooms poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like to watch porn with lesbians.
Who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure that John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that lock on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was worried right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already do.
She's writing a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was pretending to be surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to swim the river.
Tom was here earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old housewife has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We've barely been saved.
Did they hire you?
It's a gas leak.
Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little dazed.
Let's do this right.
You can be on Hawaii all year long.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most feel that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just walk up to a woman and pick her up - it's considered sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's all set.
You can't do what you think you're doing.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was smoking a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It's better to be optimistic and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull of the ship is divided into more watery parts.
Since you've been cooking, I'll be washing dishes.
Let's leave this topic behind.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You can't lose control.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Don't be mad at me."
He's not the shy guy he was anymore.
You know what I mean?
Don't make a scene now.
What was said to Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys everywhere divided into groups, some playing jamleys, some tiles, some with a ball, others riding a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a beautiful gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I was just having breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy's coming from inside.
Nobody believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He hit his head.
We're on our way.
Put the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom's getting angry.
I don't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
I find it hard to make new friends.
It's funny how people in the tropical areas eat seasoned food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell what the baby wants, because it points to both of them.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim was never abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false clue.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're having lunch?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a clip on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can't read or write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get inside.
Tom and I made a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom will eventually get out of jail.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
I'm sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first one to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Consider how much money we're going to need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does she cost over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of his computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was on my lungs, I was just napping in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom's got a headache.
Well, don't be.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
You did your best.
He's greedy.
First, let's talk about what Tom has to do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not gonna take that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a dork.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them you'd give them right away.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the solution?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd get them some help.
Maybe it'd be best if you called them.
No. Some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts so much.
Then we were eighteen years old.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I'm upset to see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran.
Keep doing that.
This is resilient.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom's starting to regret it.
I think you should choose her.
They're being held up.
You're a big boy.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out your candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.

Tom looks decisive.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I swam in the river.
Are you done yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joke.
I've had a lot worse.
Tom was trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
I only had one glass.
No one's writing to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mom told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone's in control.
Every customer has his rights.
I'm only calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's been accusing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not very tough.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change your shampoo?
Tom was looking around. He didn't expect anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.

Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to be scared.

I'm gonna stop.

Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the hill.
I'll take whatever it is.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.

You'll be fine.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's dead.

I'll make sure we finish this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?

Tom often takes a walk before dinner.
She stayed up late yesterday.
You're a mess.
Everybody shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?

It's not just a guess.
How are we gonna find them?
It might seem strange.
No one can save themselves from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.

Let's do it.
Tom's become famous.

Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they pay pretty well.

Go find him.

I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom cut his hair.
Everybody's sitting down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't feel good walking.

I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're running to get started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So, I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Should I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank you letter.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.

I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.

That's close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone acquires their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
It stretches so much when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I'm hiding him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I ran away from class.
Tom's still tied up.

Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.

My family starts where your family ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?

We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Is that possible, Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was voted mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the scene.
I asked the same question.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saved the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's going to tell him.
Tom to Mary was sitting.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a hottie.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this on my own.
They've probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure you know this isn't making diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The time in April is unsustainable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut off the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom has two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left unsatisfactory food on the plate.
Tom changed course.
There's no man alive in the classroom.
Missile's in the air.
We laughed.
Tom was a little daft.
Tom only came to visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was very thoughtful.
Tom tried to look busy, so that Mary did not ask him to help her.
I don't eat meat very rarely.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm saving his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers are quick to get married after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I know how to fly.
Our money's been spent.
There was hate between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I wouldn't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I've never known to be anything but who I am.
Sometimes it is difficult to determine whether Tom is happy or not.
This doesn't heat me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you think of a wish?
Sometimes children fear darkness.
Stay back.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's sad.
Cuban hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
That's who I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I've heard them go down.
Too bad I didn't ride a wheel here.
I have to visit Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is an e-mail.
That's not so much.
That's what he said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What'd you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to overshadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to look at another option?
He didn't give us a chance.
He suddenly showed up.
I'll do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all of Mary's friends.
That'd be fun.
He's a sex car dealer.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too many.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tape doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get ugly.
I didn't know whether to get mad or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at 7:00.
I've always loved a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is whether to come to visit us next month.
Marionettes run them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were teasing her about her clothes.
You're gonna get confused.
I won't follow you.
Maybe Tom already did what he had to do.
I'll give them one more chance.
He just called me.
Failure suppressed him.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people fear spiders.
Even she doesn't understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants harm bees of health.
Now you can go.
They're stalling.
Tom's the second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
Tourists were not happy.
Tom's room socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom pecking.
The laws are like cobwebs -- they hunt flies, but they let the axes and the scarecrows break through.
You're prouder than a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left the key to his desk, as he used to.
He took off his fur jacket downstairs, climbed up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same thing on this subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something's happened to Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're a city.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
Did Tom stay long?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Have you seen Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat that?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
This handle doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my note.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Dear for good."
We were very close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
No one defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
There's a big day waiting for us tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me breathe.
What do you know about cloning?
I just found it under the couch.
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so happy to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can chain me up, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat buried his claws in my hand.
"When you fell asleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What did you do so late?" "I was on the phone with my ex."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little overworked with something else.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're disturbing me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom's not as naive as many people think.
I hit him in the jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm gonna take a break for lunch.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really gonna get married.
Everybody turned down Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken collects old coins.
There's a lot to tell.
I heard what you were saying.
We have to face the facts.
No damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose between?
We gotta get them to bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's what I got close to Tom.
I don't want to push them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep driving and caused a car accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why does Tom do that?
I have a job for you.
How do you form a set of names?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I got a nasty cold from him.
It's getting better.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't even get mad.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom needs a haircut.
Get me some coffee.
You're doing really good.
That was a sneaky trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in jail for spying.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom don't get too disappointed.
These little letters are only read with a stick.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cuter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I won't hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sorrow in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I'd do anything to make money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say something you don't mean.
I decorated my room.
This is madness!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
Just let Tom make his beak.
Our plague was approaching the small island.
You're not gonna win.
Wait a minute. I'm done with my laundry. I'm gonna go get it.

It's all white.
I wish I had the strength of my will to hold my diet.

I've never been here before.
That trumpet sounds really bad to me.
I'm tired of my eyes.
I need to get away from her.
Tom makes $300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Are you expecting them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
A boy grabbed my bag while he was passing by a wheel.
When's the last time you got the baby?
My muscles hurt a little.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm ugly.
They're gonna fire me because I'm so late for work.
I thought it might be nice to buy you some earrings.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's it!
There's always a trick.
Your health is very important to me.
Spirit, are you there?
There's no smokers here.
Is your freezer still working?
The city restored that old, historical building.
I can't ask him to.
He's really ugly.
Tom came back covered in mud.
That's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's in the pool with his friends.

We just got there.
Tom booked the seat.
I want to use this.
What color were Tom's socks?
Tom baked me a cake.

Tom left for the wheel.
He's back at 6:00.
It has been shown that the fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those who live on cats.
Watch your step up the ladder.
Was he with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What's this made of?
Butler opened the door.
Tom made no mistake.
Get your paws off me.
Don't say that name around me.
Are you gonna throw that away?
Tom's got a good profession.
They're my things.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom changed the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It feels so good.
What's Tom drinking?
I'm going to read this.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom suffered a catastrophic failure.
You just got back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text's too long.
When did you come to Boston?
Something bit me.
The mushrooms contain significant quantities of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back at work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid to face a mistake than make a mistake.
This is a stupid question, but who's stronger, the lion or the tiger?
We'll have company.
We're classmates.
Tom pulled the tap out of the champagne.
There's a girl missing.
Tom despises your impudence.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of the places he wanted to visit.
From his eyes, I concluded that I was angry.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me a red and white rose.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
You shot three times.
I'll complain if I want to.
They're gratis.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in choir.
I won't say another word.

Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see him.
Tom was just partially joking.
I'm gonna find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid being captured.
Have you found her yet?
Tom's alone out there.
You did a good job.
Don't be gay.
Freedom of speech is limited in certain countries.

We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend a good book?
I'll take you home.
Does your stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You don't cut me.
Try to wash yourself.
I think I love you.
I care about all of you.
They've been hammered by her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
Don't wait now.
Have you seen Tom?
I could use some help with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
That was an amazing night.
The smell of jasmine and lavender is my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom was kind of bored.
She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very sharp top.
Get ready.
Put it down here.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you if you were the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them sleep.
Did they all agree?
These are my prayers.
Aren't you going away?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is extremely warm.
No one wanted to get off the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom came by earlier.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.

I'm sorry, but I don't feel like it right now.
When was the last time you were in an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I love vanilla ice cream.
I just had breakfast.
Step by step, he goes down the stairs.
That shouldn't happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make popcorn.
Tom put a stethoscope on the patient's chest.
Should we call him?
My sister got more presents than I did for Christmas.
What's going on with you at work?
What does language have and doesn't taste?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped yelling.
Were there any survivors?
I'm still at work.
Tom's warm.
Where's the bathroom?
Tom seems to know everything.
She had twins.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
What's Tom afraid of?
Tom would stand up to it.
What kind of shampoo do you use?
He's good at playing cards.

What were they doing?
I think you should handle this on your own.
As far as I can tell, there's nothing wrong with Tom from a medical point of view.
I saw him play cards with them all.
Tom seems confidential.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a tail?

Eats can be seasoned without being angry.
Bring her home.
I'd help if I could.

I wasn't sure what to do.
I wish I hadn't married Tom.
I know what this is.
When's Tom arriving?
Could you hand me the remote control?
I'm gonna make him cut your lawn.
You help her once.
We were crying in a duet.
I'll set the table.
I have a lot to say.
I was in the bedroom.
Shouldn't have any problems.
It's hard to imagine.
Where's the nearest workshop to repair the DJ?
Where did you and Tom go?

I don't know what I got.
I haven't fixed that yet.
I don't work for him.
I can't wait to go home.
Tom committed suicide on his 30th birthday.
Let's go and see what happens.
The concert piano doesn't have pedals at all.

I know a city whose residents never smoked.
I must have forgotten.
Tom got Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom can do almost anything.
We arrested him.
What else could you have done?
Please sign here.
I'll see if he's in there.
It'll be beastly.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order a pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?
Tom doesn't seem to speak French.
Fruit contains seeds.
You're doing good.
I don't have enough time to do what needs to be done.
The forest is my home.
There's an swelling on his head.
Vampires cannot cross the threshold of a certain house without being invited.
I think Tom's a mess.
I need peace and quiet after a hard day at work.
If you ignore the past, you threaten the future.
The windows in my room are cracked.
Do you hate him that much?
I want justice.
Why don't we go pick them up?
Please, find her.

I'm not ready yet.
This bird can't fly.
I'm not a trucker.
Tom's studying law school.

Tom was hanging out in Boston a year ago.
I just saw him.
What's gonna happen to us?
My hometown is by the ocean.
I left home at seven.
How's it going, Tom?
The wind changed course.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you got here?
I can't get an assal response from Tom.
I just wish I'd found out earlier.
Is there anything missing?
I didn't do it for him.
She felt pretty lonely.
I'm going hunting on my own time.
Where'd my driver go?
He's in trouble.
The coat is covered with fur.
Tom's ugly.
When did you buy that with Tom?
I've been briefed.
He slept hard.
I had no doubt about that.
The pins are made in bottles.
Tom doesn't see it that way.
Tom was sitting on the stairs talking to a girl named Mary.
I know what you had for lunch.
I always eat.
Tom gave Mary the message from John.
Your wishes are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask you a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not much of a sailor.
My dad got a fire on the white Drops last month.
What a sad story!
Make sure you get a good night's sleep.
I don't think I'm gonna live much longer.
You need to help her.
They're worried about him.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom plays in a band and he's very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom's interest faded.
Let's play volleyball.
Yesterday was fun.
Tom may help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating at restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think he's gay, he's married, and he's got three kids.
That was a secret, wasn't it?
I wouldn't think so.
I was eating chicken medallions.
I had a dream come true.
This is a wooden table.
The situation is tense.
I'm interested in Greek mythology, too.
The watcher has a good place.
I'm in charge of propaganda.
We gotta get him to bed.
Tom had respect for Mary.
Tom and Mary haven't heard from John in a long time.
You're not dressed.
They're pretty good.
Did you confess to that?
Tom's diabetic.
Call it what you want.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They were verbally harassed.
Why were you chasing me?
I've been pretty busy.
I couldn't do what you did.
Are you always busy?
Tom heard the noise.
You're below her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the one who owns it.
What is the origin of the universe?
Whoever calls, tell him I'm out.

Sheep feed on grass.
Tom's gonna give up.
I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom gave up thinking about going to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom seems effective.
I need to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take him.
It's nothing to do with luck.
I think you know the rules.
I sincerely regret it.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back at 6:00.
Let these people go.
Tom's eye didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll arrange for you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The lion saw her.
I need to turn off the phone.
Time's good.
This was wrong information.
Nobody wants to be around him.
Dan saw him talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom's easy to do.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a cherry in front of my house.
He's the company boss.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm so busy getting ready for the party.
It won't get any better.
He's already done his job.
I need you to cover my ears.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to make any trouble at all.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston at two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's studying in deaf school.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very safe.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I took so long.
I don't want to wait.
What's that, invisible to him?
Radio's off.
I rejected Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money at a bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You'll go with me and the dot!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us do our best.
I'll pay.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I came here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
That's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Envying is a sin.
All the kids are aliens.
I got shot.
Tom's not prone to drama.
I finished twenty-five projects in just a month.
Tom couldn't go look at us through the lock.
This tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
That chair isn't very vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did someone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to speak French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going to the point.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They were chased.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were after you.
Let's go down the street.
There wasn't a soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig you wells.
I have a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you so much.
You're cooking nice.
There's no short way to the top, just until the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's paying a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked them all.
Automatic cars are now spread out.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom wears chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I've been waving Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The organ was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
His aunt eats apples or bananas?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making eggs.
I love the blue color.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't get my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the game?
They picked it up pretty good.
What does all that mean?
I did what I could.
We have three kids.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was my duty to spend the night with a smart, funny, and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a punk.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He got dressed to get his hat on.
The river of sweat started pouring on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you guys hang out?
The movies are great entertainment.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me want the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests should we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't ask you for an opinion.
They canceled our flight due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
The singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they're coming back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom made everything a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
Don't come out the drum.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom's milk.
I gave her a fake address.
I'm in my room.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a big chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The cashier I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl's got a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's pooping.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does he buy Tom?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything's quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Come on, wake up.
I'm having a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether or not she can.
Tom ran up.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were dating only girls who were lower than you.
I need to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost got into a fight with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He was building a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What makes you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come on in time.
The Germans have a slight attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a big grave.
Women like men with mustaches.
You forget your wallet again.
Do you accept tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't, then who?
I wish I could have been like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They're both screaming.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't lucky.
His body was grown with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I pissed Tom off a lot.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The island's settlers are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always preferred mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most prominent American writers.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom will never come back here again.
Nobody likes crybabys.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the far mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's a real dick.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We're here first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought some smelly garbage bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely leaves.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where he hid Tom's diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport's expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How come you made such a mistake?
Your memory's good.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We're bringing them some bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room you didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
I'm sure you already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do on your own time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a whip in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked.
Who made the doll?
I haven't lost hope for a moment.
Her long hair was boned brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I love someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I learn French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientella makes her mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why do you mind that?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname looks perfect to him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You took out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom's not happy to come.
Tom seems a little down this morning.
No one understands me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked the mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that topic with you.
Did he ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Pass the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and kindly bowed down.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's a skilled writer.
Tom looked at it.
My ears are pounding.
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a bastard!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to fall down.
Tom suspended him.
They were laughing.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like a marined fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom seems distracted.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that's what bothered us?
We may find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're not.
He's been working at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's pissed off.
It's from work.
We'll manage.
Appreciation encourages students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about 30 years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
The day was attacked by two men.
Tom measured on the scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's had a lot of changes last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom's got his nose up.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “lady ” was used only for nobles.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How to choose a man just one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I don't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on a bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They're paying me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't have been safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your child's laughter.
Tom thinks Mary and I are up to something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunders tattoo?
Don't mix business and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
You put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy working.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's unbuttoned.
This is one of mine.
Nothing stops us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and directed it to the wall.
This is a domestic jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the weed.
Tom writes very well.
That's not true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as it hits him, his heart stops.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank loaned one million dollars to the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play harder.
My son always stops me talking.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive by myself.
I guess I drank too much yesterday, but I'm really hungover.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember his name.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom was moving very carefully.
Just go inside.
He forged a steel sword.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I said mine.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's a single.
The woman calls her husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had a lot more than we did.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did he want to see, Tom?
I'm so scared.
Day's getting angry.
I don't even know which one.
I'm not ringing them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their goal?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you study in?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
It did a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
My blood vessel broke in my eye.
That's where you visited Mary yesterday.
She's out of line!
He's got a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show will give up; they haven't sold anything many cards.
Tom's going.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't make the kid eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laugher.
Tom paid me.
It's my job to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems kind of messed up.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone's got their own faults.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what he was planning on cooking Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I got the impression it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come with a car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Even though Jane had one suitcase less than me, she complained she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom's here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was going to do the bazooka.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only fault.
Do you remember what you wore when I met you?
The lightning is usually accompanied by lightning.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom knocked him on the ground.
This lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the cup cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to hook up with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How come you're still not sleeping?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned down the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I've made a fine plea.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this adventurous?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just get this job done.
I think Tom's great.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he could play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar sounds good.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way it holds its head reminds me of Mary.
Don't mind my way.
We're looking for them now.
I got my shoes on.
Tom would fight back.
She always works hard.
What state are you a citizen?
Elephant-bone trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet with Tom.
I prefer cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you took a lot of care of Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
It doesn't support this heat.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you immediately.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it like that.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep doing your job.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you can say.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree sails.
We'll keep in touch.
We're doing everything together soon.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits down for long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchens.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'm gonna get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her back?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom can't feel it.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
The noise made me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know things.
Was everything just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited that we're about to get to Pluto.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me at the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is that Tom?
I'm having trouble with my sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's a skilled pill-handler.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any web sites.
He's been putting the plan down.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been coming back for a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a spinpop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's on the ceiling.
Her face was bloated with sperm.
Tom's fair.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand what happened to you.
Tom strives to become a teacher.
I wish you a good week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to leave now.
Why did God make me this ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's too expensive.
We're acting childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
The answer is alcohol, I can't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shake blew the tire.
We made wood.
This is so much better.
I'm gonna make her cut your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom was always stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a mess.
Your sons are quite handsome.
I know what it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and thigh.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They've got the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days ago last spring.
You only think she's weird because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't resist that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
It's still bad.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Were you being honest?
The filter was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give up.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire came to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is under threat.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you back.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still after pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror gets clouded in the bathroom.
Tom took pictures.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, how about you?"
The lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They've raised my salary again.
I'll never get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I can go.
I contribute.
It was a disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I've come up with everything.
I'd like to know why they erased my name from the list.
Tom put all this together.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's soft.
Before, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a shot.
I did what I had to do.
Tom's a long way away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not taught that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
You've got a certain Mr. Kimura on the line.
Men and women are people of opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was dropping the puss.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help it.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you want on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's files to the Bureau.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't think so.
What's on the agenda?
There's plenty more.
These two seem to be in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
A moral choice is the translator's whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language he produced.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think what you want.
I thought I'd get him some help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look around.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems worried.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oval, the distance between planets and the sun constantly varies.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in the eye and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all good.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
Yeah, you found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be famous for time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20th, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need any enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We could eat lunch on a bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would love John.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does he have to leave, Tom?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a drug in powder.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you harassing them.
It depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom's got a bad reaction.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was measuring you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was very pleased to have met her granddaughter.
That's our best shot.
It smells like flowers.
Tom's gone nuts.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.
It's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night they killed Tom.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
You've resulted in a lot of difficulty.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think they're on to it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Well, didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold back.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or me.
My computer's dead.
My grandmother used to live with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
So our conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You're wrong.
We're glad to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen releases the green light.
English became my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The wound of the knee now rots.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary got scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom's a farmer.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
How long has Tom been sleeping?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint with a mint?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
The blood just broke into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy you'd be easy to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The children drew pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
You're wondering what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I have to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom married 26 years old.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
I don't see what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast of the magnificent scales she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you have in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying the piano.
They need the money.
She's swimming well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom calculated with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick off.
Guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me as soon as it's light.
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
Tom seems startled.
Tom stepped in.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you grinning about?
I'll call him right back.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt this loved.
I can't control it.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll come with the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom, I'm not very fond of you.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you see that?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write your words?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night when I was 13.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
It's what I do for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just my troubles.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's pissed off.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to sow my thirst.
Tom got here in time.
It's boring television today.
Oh, great!
Tom found a four-list kid.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got to say goodbye to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's the law!
The water has penetrated the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom's safely here.
I can stay.
I don't see any customers complaining.
There, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Take care of the sparks that fly from the fire.
It's just made-up.
Tom kept his mouth shut all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I'm laughing.
Let's raise a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the test as close as possible.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He had a terrible kiss in her mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was a mess.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He was pretty restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom's pissed off.
This is from us.
On an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary's got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom's got asthma.
Tom started moaning.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it'll be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We have everything.
I baked his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be forgeries.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is untouchable.
His girlfriend's weak.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming out of the nightmare.
Tom's got a weak vision.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
They all want lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom took his eyes off.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put your coat on.
You could be wrong.
I baked a cake, too.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It's been an honor.
I spoke to my counselors about which items to take.
I already wrote everything that was to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can get some rest.
Boston's worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in a room under this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in his ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're so cheeky.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Dadeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask me to Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back with him.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden for him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They spread their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and stuck another one in that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you back.
She's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
The cows are not clear anyway.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's deep.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them cut you.
The dissection is energy consumption.
Tom went into rehab.
They'll pay good money.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are both difficult and easy, and you are pleasant and bitter; I cannot live without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
Nobody complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
It disappoints him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I understood.
Tom's a spineless man.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm in charge.
Tom hit Mary on the head with this one.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is a lot of fusherical writings.
You should help them.
Tom wasn't even crying.
He wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
Nothing is more regrettable than stupidity and indifference.
They're all gonna be fine.
Tom didn't protest.
What's with the web sites?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
It's been snow cleaning all day.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far away?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a paper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the tap out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture attached to the chimney.
The doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
It's over now.
I'm getting some sleep.
There is no scientific evidence that there is a link between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I like your website very much.
I'll get you.
Hit this button.
Tom really can fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom got his car ripped off.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards have eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is roasted in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I'm making a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is so much like mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have any sheds.
A lot of wood collapsed.
Lions don't distinguish colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can picture you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a paragraph from one of those letters.
Tom noticed he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
We're running a gnome from the right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom has never told me he doesn't speak French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Putting the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They cast a curse on us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
The turtles live long.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom's sleeping really tight.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get a car this far?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Can you wait a minute?
You're amongst friends.
You're a little weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a hot night.
Thanks for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer the eggs from the sub-type.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would I help him?
Tom lit his shoes.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
Actually, I was born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom loaned me some money.
Am I bothering you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They'd like that a lot.
I'm a faggot.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come on, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm chasing.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's sucking on the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my expenditure this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom's got his face cut off.
What good do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when she's wearing those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live upstairs under this one.
They believed her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but it didn't buckle.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
The dolphins are kind of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's making fun of you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to watch his kid.
I underlined the word "Alice" to point it out.
Third chance.
We need to get out of here.
This is an airtest popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for virtues and give up vices.
You're clear.
I'm against this project.
Weren't you tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty harmless.
There are reports of writing.
It hurts here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now so you can finish tomorrow.
You jumped one button.
Diseases often occur at the most awkward time.
The dog's staring at me like he wants to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies when they do.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I've been thinking about her for days.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
This building is a monster building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats are bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is this true in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She has ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger potion.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I guess you read my report.
Tom's back off.
Don't repeat yourself.
The red ones are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
You've upset Tom.
Stop him.
Tom looked like he was insolent.
What else can Tom do?
I want to get physically and mentally stronger.
She's a lively girl.
If I could stay, I'd stay.
Please stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to leave.
Do you have a map from Boston?
Let's just remember, you didn't fall.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test.
You were lucky to have survived the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was a good talker.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
It's just me.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your wheel dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's go to lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What'd you say?
Make two lines.
The titles should draw the attention of readers.
He was sitting right in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I saw a French film with an English translation.
Tom was making fun of Mary.
Tom's full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says that child’s illnesses are false.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at the wedding.
Which one would you choose, Tom?
The hospital's not that big.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I don't rub their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I don't want to, and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls go into puberty at the age of ten to eleven, and boys from eleven to twelve.
She's on her way.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon cheer up.
The wall's cold in touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I can't tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was dressed up.
It was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't get involved when you get home.
Tom taught me how to sing.
"What kind of book do you read?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That weapon is not a toy, boy!
Half of the species is getting married.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
They're Tom Dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do community service to make up for everything I've done.
Tom tied his cords.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I should have taken into account in translation.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Is the axe poisoned?
The kidnappers tied their eyes.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary has been very supportive.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I've been waiting outside for you.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the bonton.
You've seen what I can do.
We've got a lot of money.
Does your appearance suit your age?
Can I have it?
Not everything is honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom's suffocating.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was preparing a speech.
The falcons have a sharp vision.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was honking.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom smiled politely.
The teapot's pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom took off his weight.
They went for a walk.
This is his mother's grandfather's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he should take care of some things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
The little island from far looks like a turtle.
Do they bite trout?
What did you ask Tom?
Stop blanating.
I'm 30 years old.
His acting is not perfect at all.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't have much time left.
The dog barked at him.
Let's go to a movie.
Handsome women grow old much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He tripped him.
Mary felt her face warmed up.
I know what bothers Tom so much.
I thought Tom retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
That's what's useless about blowing up jams.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She works out of nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what you're saying?
I'm in a terrible pain here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom's been cut off.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That thing is done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the painting.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nicer to each other.
Tom's replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
They're all gonna tell him.
Faith implies that you hope for what your mind cannot hope for.
Tom was hanging out with me.
Tom was wondering why Mary wouldn't help him.
You've ruined your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent to value.
We rented a movie.
The heart's coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick a weapon.
They've chosen a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's pulling in the back.
We appreciate our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They wanted their salary up.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
Earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't already eaten, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He was gonna say something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
How about I see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you love.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's a smooth thing to do.
That was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan doesn't work.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understood?
My day was full of action.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father's sick with flu.
I haven't waited very long.
Just look at yourself.
This is magnificent.
It's missing blank at both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
Soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The store's closed.
They listened.
Tom's out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's pissed off.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They've decomposed it.
Tom's a big deal.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I asked around about them.
I'm sleepy.
I plan to go to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
It's like an eel.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the barrel.
I'd be happy to ride with Tom.
It's time again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do it.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting on the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go get Tom and come back.
I don't see any conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take out the mask.
It's an unsuspecting option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm embarrassing myself.
I liked the way you dance.
I need you a little.
They lied to us.
Tom's right.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've disfigured him.
She's white.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
The shoes are making me sick.
Tom hasn't said anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home in the rain.
It's nice to be alone.
Tom's got a lot of money, but he doesn't have any friends.
Each color has its meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I'm out of breath.
Can you get those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your policy is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I messed up.
You cut me off.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in the city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice has melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I'm always getting up early.
It must have made it so easy for you.
I've never been caught.
I love my country.
I haven't learned to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't tempt me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They see each other in the mirror.
I don't feel like crying.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two have gone against me!
I've never worn a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't get in the way.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary caught the fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
I have to buy a new nigger for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What's this really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary have left us since day one.
Come on, let's hang out.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's exactly what Tom did.
"Don't you want to eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off his weight.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real skin and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom's singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She's wearing a leather belt on her waist.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom gave Mary a hard time.
I'm gonna go look for them.
Tom came by when it rained.
I don't want to use dildos. I prefer real dicks.
I'm not gonna cook for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing Sunday.
Tom got surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to find out what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's gonna go alone.
Tom only had Fridays at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
You did great.
I wish I could tell my real name to people.
The dentist implanted a temporary filling.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They contacted the local politicians.
Tom's got the notes.
They gave me this card.
We're going to have a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone's got their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat the apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 allowance a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom cut me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with your elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you want robots?
They're losing their minds.
He's really turning me on.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often harassed at school.
When does it start?
The bear is self-involved.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three coffee spoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom, calm down.
The glove has a hole in its thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's how I doubted it.
Tom doesn't do what he has to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe isn't your friend, it's just... it's... it's just... it's... it's... it's just... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What'd you cook for dinner?
What did you do then?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in this market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom's the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'll take a bath first.
Tom's 30 now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
He became a teacup only a few days before he turned 90 and nine.
Did you ask everywhere?
It's important to have the idea that no one is ever anything 100 percent.
He gestures while speaking.
Sit next to me.
Tom's thrilled.
Tom never gives anyone money on loan.
I'm truly happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633, however, because of his age and fragile health, they allowed him to serve that sentence in domestic detention.
Scientists claim that people who laugh longer live than those who run over a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom cut out the tree.
The earth is still watered, it's likely to give up the sword.
I had a nap.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked dick?
The dog was following me.
That was Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
He's trying to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're very sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's silly.
Tom's very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom's a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there silently.
I'm collecting postmarks.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
This room looks like a cognac.
I'm not talking about him.
That's all he's got.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you whenever he wants.
I wouldn't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to leave and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Porcelains are mild.
That doesn't matter.
I like comic books.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I talk to you?
The pods are falling out of the tree.
Do you have a band?
You can wait here.
I got five in French.
I want the class quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetric.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind's blowing.
It's a risky plan.
How fast does it get from here to the post office?
I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you gonna dress this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not so warm myself.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there's an unforgivable act, it's the act of refusing to forgive.
The door's sealed.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
She's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary saw him.
You've had enough of me.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
Eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You haven't asked why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let me talk to you.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky has cheered up.
The noise will wake the baby.
Look straight ahead.
That's not exactly something a man should be getting ready for.
Tom and Mary play rummy.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
He raised the book.
Don't take my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked in two hours.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on his way.
From his long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and doughnuts.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it's done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both smiled again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Did you study outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom felt the danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
It was our only comfort.
He wouldn't care.
Have you written in your diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can he do it himself?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of jail.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't take it.
I knew the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into it right now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'll try to get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause a disease.
We're ready up and down.
Tom's got a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not happy with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the drum out.
I helped him clear the table.
I had a steak with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them sedatives.
Your faith is nasty.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could have found someone else.
Get me back in two and a half.
Tom's been drinking.
I slept in the can.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Aren't you cold in short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Assal Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We bake them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look for it in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun if we went to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
You've got me all over my head.
You need to be careful.
Tom seems like he's doing a lot of work.
Your party continues your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
Demek need to know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing nothing.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just pulled Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd have sold this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son likes rockets very much.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He came before them.
Here you go, brother, half.
Tom sent her to the table to the new men he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's fucked up.
The landscape is overwhelming.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test him.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom celebrated victory with wine.
We don't have all week.
I'll try to contain myself.
The fall is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to buzz.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so great.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal by dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of general human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderbolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything on his own.
What's the best part?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup's too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Is that "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
Seems familiar.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosilnik, sage, rosemary, timian, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a insightful man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have fooled you, but she's not going to lie to me!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled a few coins.
The room was a corporal.
It's just to solve this task.
They have to remove the bullet that got stuck in his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunflower.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
I guess you don't know how it hurts to get stabbed.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a thick vegan before.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so forth.
I don't know how he did it, Tom, but there he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it doesn't come in consideration to ask Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like it all.
- Are you in the dark? - No.
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him makeup.
I was waiting outside for her.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
How about your name and phone number?
Tom used to throw rocks at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry about Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a few reasons to think of.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
He hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
Everyone's got a kick out of it.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called "The Russians are coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still incapable of writing his name?
Tom put the journal in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days till Christmas?
He wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
That's not what I'm good at.
Tom's got a baboon collection.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The mouse is a plague transporter.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's getting ahold of it.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not predict the fall of the monarchy.
I'm creeping myself out of Tom.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep driving and caused a car accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom says hello to Mary for waving.
That's okay.
Tom seems concerned.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It snowed last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us approximately three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would you do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You care too much about him.
The president announced that the United States would launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be a sweetheart.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
It sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his cords.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom can't hear us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is that what this is all about?
Tom's gone off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there a complaint?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an irrevocable fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little chilly.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer black.
Tom gave himself up to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Medellin.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
There's a lot of mammals out there.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
You erased your wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom's moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
The book will help you write skillfully.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, take the room down.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd seen Mary this morning.
I'm making honey toast in the morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have many lands.
The area is very isolated.
I'm guessing the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making cake.
Look at the number.
I'm impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'll take off my weight.
That's exactly what happened.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefits do we benefit from that?
I'm with exactly who I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick talk.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary may agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I wasn't sorry about them.
Tom felt he needed to make amends.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your equal.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
He's waving his dog with a rock.
Tom kept staring.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demek wrote this book himself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be cocky.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must destroy it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go in a couple.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom confessed to spilling red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We've visited Laura's castles.
Tom is hopeless.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help search for Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Grab my hand just.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedantic in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I do a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to go.
Tom's kind.
What was the party like yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan's turning into a pie maker.
You've got a lot of perky eyes.
Doesn't that make sense?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Will you get back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Blow it and get inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems reliable.
Would you like some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
It develops addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat there and kept quiet.
Bring the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary threw herself at her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
Nobody listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Mission accomplished.
Tom wiped the knife blade off the jeans.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
We're giving a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better stop by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you get off?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how it's possible.
You looked at me hard through the glasses.
Linda got Dan to smoke it.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not disturb Tom.
It's a tough rope.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to get us out of here.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did you hurt yourself, Tom?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression for many periods of his life.
You want me to take your bags?
I would trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
Class went wild.
There were penguin feet on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a paw.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul likes.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was starving.
She's studying Anilian.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a famous writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit on the chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easily bad habits are gained!
She's starting to act weird.
Probably won't pay off the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she had an interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're also strong with you.
The president seemed strong.
What do you want me to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were better at playing chess than I am.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not saying that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people fear enough, anything can happen.
You're a narrow city.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck's dead.
Grab the day.
What's the bell, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Make sure the buyer's careful.
Tom's been running away from class a lot.
Now is the time for compensation.
Most virgins have an entire hymns.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me Communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom's interested in French history.
Because the bus was holding back, we waited a long time in the rain.
You'll manage.
Does she have a dog?
I'm getting some rest.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
I got my shoes on.
That drug calms the patient.
Tom's next crime will be the last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherman did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what they need to do.
The bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to your boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's good work.
Tom got sick badly.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just dumped him.
I prefer goat cheese from cow.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut the wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini, finish it.
One - sex couples should not be able to marry.
The cow forgot it used to be a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom buried him alive.
Sewing is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister rip off the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put the cigarette out?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
That's when I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other barks.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is supposed to be the best disinfectant.
You're gonna get yourself a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
You're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
You hung me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
You bring it after lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood circles through the body.
I'll get him to go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My right leg's thumb hurts.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom's baking attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
The stone built their houses.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really mean that kind of thing.
It's got wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole crew.
At what age did you begin your period?
You're annoying me.
But not before the choir.
The firm went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not much of a talker.
You were right, guys.
It happens.
There were no others injured.
I decided to take a train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a difficult task.
You need to get him to listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, darling.
They increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must have known about that already.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
I've been looking all over for them.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It's gone red.
I have to go.
Who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom caught a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mom?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these advice in mind.
His pronunciation is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where did you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back before the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't have to be there for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
I had a headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars, and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't feel guilty.
Isn't that unusual?
I fell off the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom wrapped the scarf out of his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower stood in the midst of ruins.
Tom's a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me the pliers.
The Haas love the cold weather.
This is a little loose in my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the bull.
Canada is producing good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom, it went well today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing?
Now this is your house.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing just what I wanted.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, no charges have been made.
Desire is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw that Mary was about to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They sowed the seed, and grew it up, and married it: and the waterbirst was on the side of the river.
He feels hate for his dad.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom drove Mary home.
I do a lot of skiing.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When's my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It's not often someone who buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan made his assistants laugh with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely got saved so I wouldn't get caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom came back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's gonna make it up to the giant?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
I don't mind it here.
You tricked me.
It's for the heat.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one actually knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're chasing her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
You seem to have an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red in the twilight.
I'm here to wish you luck.
It would be my pleasure if you would come.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I speak bad English.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy you beat?
Dan got this right.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
The room was quiet.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a hard test.
It's warm here in hell.
I've overlooked it.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
He's studying here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
You kids stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
Wonderful!
The palace has a tall tower.
Kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's out of the way.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't sleepy.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom came here himself.
I forgot my scarf.
We've had a lot of time.
Tom wanted everyone to think he died.
Scientific research often calls for difficult compromises.
Tom just got his prosthetics removed.
I have to try and find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake Mary.
You almost missed it.
I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you for who you are.
It's funny.
It relaxes a lot.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was compromised.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying that?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom missed the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long has the road been going?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom's been raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's been blind since birth.
The book contains fifteen resumes.
Tom's been working all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
The socks and shoes are new.
I haven't had pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
Tom's buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Dahida died of an overdose with sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a throat.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, it's raining.
Ish, dog!
They jumped into the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass brainiac.
Tom didn't come home at all last night.
I think we've had enough.
This is very difficult for them.
Witches don't cry.
Tom taught me to make pancakes.
The car washer is Mr. Jones.
Tom seems appalled.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston right now.
That's her.
I can give you a lift.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom can handle it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the task?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Do you have any sports?
It just sounds boring.
Get him inside.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom never said he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very social.
Tom can't wait any longer.
I'm just practicing to look nice when I'm naked.
Thousands of years make up a thousand.
I'll put it on your tab.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
That's an honest word.
We have three guards working in exchange.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you introduce yourself in a few words?
Tom was there.
I want you to call them.
Get your toolbox.
Is Tom contributing?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
Well, don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not naughty.
He never hired them.
I want cakes.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents ’ home.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.
Tom's a dwarf.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.
It's a spider bite.
Tom actually didn't want to live in Boston.
The price of wisdom is greater than that of pearls.

I really miss cooking for my mother.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I'm used to talking in public.
She was crying for joy.
Tom got out of jail.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for it to light green.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I waved my head off.
Tom told me he's planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a whole other story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to the end.
I'm gonna go change.
He hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never, ever could have happened here.
Tom was warming up in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
Tom swims every day.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.
Tom's allergic to mold.
I need you to try to write an honorary.
I'll sit over there.
She's older than him.
I baked them a cake.
Tom's very patient.
We can get started.
Come alone.
You've got a pencil out of your pocket.
Tom asked for his lawyer.
Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't take any chances.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom always pisses me off.
Tom's just watching.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom, don't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find it.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It rained two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you.
You really should've let me call a cab.
I baked an apple pie.
The horse's hoove gun calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing humble dresses all the time.
Did you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He's outsmarted his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom's connected to Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom for permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what do we do about it?
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is endless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day are too much?
Tom hates to run.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I was clapping with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You'd have done the same for me.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling around.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I gather a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I spit one out.
Write your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do it.
Is this your bag?
The best way to sleep will be to help her.
This is Nina, your niece.
I'll get the dishes.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
He's been very intense lately, but he doesn't see the slightest result of it.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you'd like.
I'm not sure.
That's not necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Your sister, where is she?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsession-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for stopping by.
I'm just as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
She spent the last night drinking at a local pub.
I'm in.
Do you need a date?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
It's an unspeakable joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen the rainbow.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel free.
Just smile and keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary get out of jail.
Tom doesn't have any tea.
I'm tired.
But that's no argument at all!
Tom got a drink.
What am I supposed to tell the kids now?
Leave Tom alone.
I got through the shock.
That's a good system.
I don't remember Tom this tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
Then we were just a few people among a group of gorillas.
She started sticking her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
Do you travel a lot?
Have you told Tom about the back pain you've got?
That's what everyone does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom's picking up stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water shines in the sun.
A is a set that consists of members B, B and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if you three went back outside.
What's stopping you?
Tom's got thin lips.
Kids blow bubbles.
Tom exercises violin at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
I long for it.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
You're burning the car.
She was able to learn how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I have no power at will when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the best sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is a rsum.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this kind of food?
This is one of Boston's most popular restaurants.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I'm gonna have to clean up.
I've found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to dip on a sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely heard.
Don't you do that.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just resuscitate.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is only love in search of words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom will be waiting.
You're starving to get down.
The real story is a little different than what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly coming down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something that will take our mind off our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Vardy's prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid cried and cried for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom's nothing like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn't have done it by himself.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You might need it.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me my money back.
First you have to show yourself.
My father is a silent man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional moron.
You stole my new wristwatch.
Doesn't look very different.
He's studying.
Tom made Mary's room on the bench.
We're chasing him.
It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
Did I save you?
Tom wrote me and told me about his trip.
Your pronunciation is right up and down.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary came out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the gems last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the fetus's movements?
I can't do it alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one's gonna get fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
Pull the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm good.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All the comments are too much.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them some help?
Tom threw his mouth out.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not mistaken.
Patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
Loyalty without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I used to take a nap there for hours.
Tom had a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom wants his job?
It's loud in here.
What can be done?
I guess you found him.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going dot.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom was going to fail without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
Snow is a deep one.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's banging the rattle.
I'm gonna go look for Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This is gonna work for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly what happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom listened right away.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
There is no life without hardship.
You got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me a jerk.
I'm very attracted to you.
What's for dinner?
Open on page nine.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Tom was beaten.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like the wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We had a fight.
Does Tom eat grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a gift.
I'm not quite satisfied with Tom's explanation.
I guess you're right.
He got away so he wouldn't get caught.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom hasn't been returned yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to dance with me.
Tom doesn't know anybody here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parking, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me a long time.
Tom's in the living room watching cartoons with kids.
There's no answer for everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his parents about what happened.
He was in the mud to his knees.
You told Tom about that, right?
Tom's calling Mary.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you panic?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's sensitive.
He's an honest man.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We'll turn around.
Is there anyone else?
It's still good news, because it means not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom's here to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of the interpunctional signs is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.
Will you come to Boston with us next year?
Why do you hesitate?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom was wondering if Mary had already woken up.
Do you want us to take you home?
That house was built by bricks.
We didn't make any conclusion.
Tom came in around 2:30.
Doesn't sound like anybody knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a cat attack.
The crowd clapped.
I'm letting the babies grow on the edges.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We're in business.
I was too tired to go on.
It's got its own sound.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.
I got a call yesterday night from a man named Tom Jackson.
Can this page be used like Twitter?
It should not be too difficult to complete the report by 2:30.
Tom's been doing this for a while.
Heteronormality is about sexism.
She's got a nog.
Are they your bags?
What reason do you learn English?
Did Tom leave already?
Tom must have been acting important.
Tom's still home.
This movie's worth watching.
My breasts are growing.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
Dan's back in London.
My dad bought me a digital wristwatch for my birthday.
You know me too well.
Tom's human.
Don't you feel lonely?
Did you make coffee?
Don't look so good about it.
Stop when you talk to me.
He's always happy.
The forest was very quiet.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's intruding.
Most of the clothing worn by the Europeans is produced outside Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can look online.
When I was younger, I was always traveling by bus.
I couldn't figure out exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the Internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here for them?
When I pee, there's something like a gnome coming out.
You beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet isn't your own private army.
I play volleyball a lot.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
That's what he's gonna teach them.
I have to sit down, my soul's in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom, do it.
We're ready to fight.
I suggest you listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.
Tom got hired.
It's been a really long time.
There's no way out.
The rain of the night made it hard for the survivors to try to save themselves from the broken ferry.
My wife's hiding something from me.
What can we offer guests?
Tom got mad.
Look at the number.
There must be a key.
You've cut the apple.
All the balls are yellow.
I've got a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Get on the couch.
Did they hit anyone?
The factory manufactures toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What were you singing?
I can figure it out myself.
The room has an ocean view.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like cattle.
There was water all over the kitchen floor.
The cancer is a great enemy of mankind.
He's still on sale.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
From time to time, a carriage would have passed me.
Tom put the gun down.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna get this job done in one day.
You almost had a terrible time.
Suddenly I felt old.
They piss me off.
You were getting some sleep.
I'm ready.
You killed him to avenge his dead father.
Tom's got a cookie.
I've been learning French since I was 13.
Men aren't really that different from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite oils to clean her face and cherish her skin.
I'm sick of French.
I don't care if there are twenty women.
The bull is going down.
Tom on foot.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't understand.
Born in 1960.
Can I get one?
Babours are usually mild in taste.
I'm upset.
It may rain today.
We're ready.
Let's travel to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash up.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and keep her safe.
Wouldn't you have started sucking hair out of it?
How are you gonna get away?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How will you accomplish that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these earrings from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong one.
He's in great shape.
I grabbed Tom for the elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom, listen.
I think I'm wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The noise will wake the baby.
I'm late for sleep.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the two-seater with Mary watching TV.
Nothing bothers us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
Nice to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I'm usually not at work on Monday.
I'm a fool to trust them.
Tom may need a little help.
They went to worship every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.
There's a crowd at the bar.
It's a bad idea.
Tom wondered more and more.
Who gave them that kind of money?
We have to buy them a gift.
When did the war end?
Did you do the dishwasher?
Tom's a married man.
Like Tom said, soup's too salty.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this all about?
You'll have to study more valuable next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
Nobody likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom's got two seats.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like most.
Your transgressions defiled the graves of your ancestors.
Don't be discouraged now.
It looks like her style.
I've had enough of fighting.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a journalist.
Sarah has 31 pens.
This is very confusing.
I bring terrible news.
If it were possible, I'd like to once more experience such bitter love as in primary.
I saw Tom in the area.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom broke the movie.
It's a stupid rule.
Did Tom suggest this?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his homework?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We're all eager to see the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.
We broke our conversation.
I'm training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a wonderful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't focus on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They got addicted.
I just want the money.
I don't say shit about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom disagree.
I've recovered everything completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he compassionate?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time anything unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't choose.
Is there any sugar?
Dan and Linda eventually moved to London.
She suddenly fainted.
It looked funny.
Tom's playing the band.
We're living together now.
You've been busy.
I'm sorry, isn't that a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship has changed course.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-li-li!
Tom used to say that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
According to you, how did Tom die?
I've decided to stay where I am.
I think you'll have a job up your throat.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
Should I take a picture with or without a flash?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was released.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem on my own.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's full now.
We don't sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I'm back on the bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe that's what the cat was.
The struggle doesn't seem to end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's distracted.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and then.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mom put your collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you'll be fine.
Think what you want.
Where I can find a hospital.
Don't ruin the party.
I can do that.
I don't discriminate.
I'll go if Tom goes too.
We'll be back in a month.
It is recommended to check whether there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you are taking the medication prescribed for you.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I broke in.
I want to swim.
It was from her.
We can talk to Tom.
I assumed it was free.
You're gonna need help.
Do I need a lawyer?
We need to get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom started climbing.
Tom really likes you.
Tom rang Mary.
Now I'm putting pepper on my balls for the first time.
I'll manage.
The cure worked.
Tom can play guitar.
Who broke it?
Linear's short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you very much.
I want to take you someplace where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't remember buying this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, lazy boy!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd have been avoiding Tom for a while.
I'm not waiting to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there was no internal injury.
I feel like I let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
Nobody likes us very much.
It's very rare.
I'm not good at this.
Tom's a loose candy.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
Everything's ready.
She's in a mood.
There's everything in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Beat it.
Is it all worked out yet?
Tom's listening.
Can anyone hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it get up?
I have everything in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
It was hard for us.
Harden your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on the chain.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was from them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital and he's recovering from what he's OD'd.
He cracked the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were cooking to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's the guy.
When you go on a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this isn't even the right time or the right place.
We've put her under surveillance.
Tom's untrustworthy.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet cap up.
That's good training.
This chair is self-sighted.
I should have refused.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactics.
I've lived here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my libe.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the notebook cover.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should be sorry about them.
I don't bargain.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
That's quite the cannon.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom's overly swearing.
No one's walking to Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through acts.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America you're expected to tip the waiter.
Such behavior was childish of him.
I'm walking with her.
That'd be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Leave while you still can.
Tom was a little uncomfortable around Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the carriages.
They kidnapped me.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea is delicious.
We're on the same level.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom's very strict with himself.
She's a nerd.
Lemonade's cold.
The lamp was moving backwards and forwards.
Tom seems insecure.
There's nothing else to ask for.
Tom's a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the lamppost in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
It fell off the tree.
Tom told Mary he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see it.
I'm coming.
I was in the middle of something.
Don't expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the mild things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom will stray.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I got stabbed by something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at the man.
Watch Tom.
They look familiar.
We've got work for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom was deeply interested in art history.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get some sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new to this town, and he needs a job.
I was surprised tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
He had a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you walking?
You should try it.
You're busy enough with your worries.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems concerned.
I care about him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's compassionate.
Make it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've made it.
This isn't anyone's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with pool, barbecue, football court and pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While eating pizza, he was boring his sister.
We should've given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
"Why do you do that?" "I can do it."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom let the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You're allowed to come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and trustworthy and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going down.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I won't shut up.
She shut down the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would you trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two generations in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I read.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and he's on the phone.
These are great.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom's been courteous.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to carry them.
The noise has clouded all of the city.
The one who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They're getting close.
You're mean.
Did you pass Tom's note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom's been hanging up.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears assault clothes.
Tom was barefoot.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
The girls don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I had three cold pills.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have a vodka.
Tom acts like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
It's time forever.
First of all, you have no right to conclude, second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I'm growing cattle.
She borrowed the line.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom involved?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try it.
That would be logical.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and mean.
I wish I could help you more.
You can't see Tom anymore.
I think we're done here.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park by herself.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I walked past it with a car, I didn't recognize it.
Is this all he can have?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Ask him to join us.
It will not be easy to do this without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave her a sedative.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting divorced.
That dinner.
My jar's ticking.
You're gonna have a lot of wrinkles.

Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
No one's talking.

Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic components of living things.
She's being entertained.
I have to go change.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died one day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom soon got lost in the crowd.
For the record, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a quarterback.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That's what surprised me.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a terminally transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you stink when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally smiled.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would you like that, Tom?
I misjudged her.
It'll be over soon enough.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my dad?
Tom was cooking to shoot me.
Tom's roaring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't say that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the Semir.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted them within the windows of yellow.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm happy for that.
It's like I messed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
Anything or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I are flying on the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raised the branch with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
They all smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to take time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to get rid of it.
What am I gonna do with them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got waves of hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's so strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was hit.
My conscience is biting me.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Toads are wonderful creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom got drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're a lot of shit.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I give you respect.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hound dogs.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth on each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got his hearts together.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's best advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where did you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could possibly imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to light your car.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to me in the eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to take a bath.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware that Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just be in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach, so they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on their own.
He's a little deaf, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's about you.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't it terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom put his shirt on.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, okay?
It was such a good dinner!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and sharing isn't.
I'm getting high.
Tom took off his hat and bowed down.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's papers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom had a loud longing.
It was Butter.
Tom's starting to roar.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed at her.
Maybe Tom will be dead by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was freaked out.
This can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to listen to Tom for the first time?
Tom, relax your hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The pare has clouded my glasses.
So, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the avalanche flag?
- Come on, come on. - Come on.
I told you it would be hard to pull off.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't really understand you.
Though I am a noble man, I am still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there a problem I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so mad.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to examine something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How's your chest?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met in the mines.
How was Tom doing?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The cure must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I've fallen wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't gargle.
Tom wakes up.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good at it.
Tom might be coming today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no power at will.
Will you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do this one time.
You'd better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
He used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've got the perfect cure yet.
Every member must attend.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the worst snow I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
Looks like it's not helping.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on that subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
It's my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'm going to Tom's.
Did he buy Tom presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What's luck?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
You cut your clavicle while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
Show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was insolent.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something great happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom farting.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve for that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Time to close.
Leave him to me.
The stone ran down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't cost him his heart.
You don't need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is so cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't take credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look amazed.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of the house by slippers.
I think Tom's a stickler.
I don't give a shit about the terrible infection and the ovary and it's gone.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
It doesn't come in consideration.
Tom's heading toward the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's been acting weird sometimes.
We'd hang them.
Now is probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a moment.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Trust in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we make some cranberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I've got a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, even shakedown story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is a sacred country.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come and have a drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We've got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he couldn't play tennis.
Where'd you find her? They're alive?
This was on top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we got out.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for demecvre?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you shaking at him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked us a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You took your ankle off.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little daft.
