What can I say?
I'm a little beat up.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps crying about how she doesn't have time.
Did you see Tom go?
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak it quickly.
She didn't even blink.
What did all that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
It would mean to me if you could do it to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to get the job done on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappoint me.
It's not a big deal.
How much am I gonna take?
I'm teasing you.
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head, if you talk to him in his tongue, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you in private?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put a ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.

I can't live a life like that.
Tom's hungry as a wolf.
It was a tough decision.

It remains to be seen if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom got nervous with his fingers all over the table.
Did you go out last night?
I have a game to play.
That's what a doctor needs.
I like instrumental music.
You should thank Tom with a letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?

Eat soup while it's hot.
I'm not gonna let this happen.
Let me help you avoid any problems.
I've never tried this before.
Is that what I dropped?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because he's a male chauvinist pig.
I've been everywhere in Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?
Mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thanks for fixing it.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I have no opinion of him as a musician.
Tom's been shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everybody's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where'd she go?
I think you'll be able to do that.

I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.

I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That might not be easy.
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I passed every test.
I'm sick of your wheezing.
There's only one way out.
What brother did you see?
I'll take a look.
He's very busy now.
I'm not sure if Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me anything about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kylie Mino of June 12, 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed yesterday without brushing my teeth.
The danger lurks on every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 every morning.
You're becoming careless.
Is it necessary to make such noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a rotten summer.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're very helpful, Tom.

I always thought that was weird.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.

I love watching you dance.
I'm really proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very pretty.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really looking forward to being here.
I can't answer your question with any certainty.

Let's talk about possibilities.
I was just about to suggest that you do it.
She decided to go and study in the U.S.

Tom, are you and Jom brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was over the Middle Atlantic reef - a mountain range located at the bottom of the ocean, at a depth of up to 4,500 metres.

When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?

She got up and came through the window.
It was something that led to a new idea.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's heavy.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She was intrusive.
It's getting dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.

Did you tell Tom this?
You'll destroy your eyesight if you play games all the time.
I'm a Earthman.
I can read different foreign languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things are gonna happen.
Say hello to your friends.
You still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
It'll take me a while to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We don't want to get wet.
You're kind of right.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened it.
Go straight.
Simple as beans.
I've got a lot of good things going.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm leaving school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The distance between my house and your house is two kilometers.
You're wasting your time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't work too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He was speeding up.
Try this.
There's no consequence.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is any of this real?
What are you going to do today?
He's a tradition man.
Do you have any paper I can write by?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom seemed angry.
I've never noticed that before.
Probably better not eat after seven o'clock.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.
I just want to get home.

I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I'm not swimming.
She's as beautiful as her mother.
You have a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
It's not standing.
Enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Come inside.
You win!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of moving continents, because it was so difficult to imagine that the movements of the panel were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them just as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I reacted instinctively.
You have to do this somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you upload videos to YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.

I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful to you.
You've got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's a bad kisser.
Start counting.
You can't ever come back.
He's a man of blood and flesh with all his faults.

Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
I'm sorry, I didn't follow.
Tom knows the drill.
If a man advances in front of a woman, it's called favoration, if she's promoted, in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would like to stay.
Tom's really sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I'm here.
We are who we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut your filthy mouth.
Show me the papers.

Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're absolutely right.
They can never achieve it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance at that.
He'll understand.
That's not why I'm here.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
Tom's laughing at Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if it'll be enough money for me.
Can you pull the curtains?
Have you ever tried?
That seems inhumane to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What is that, little kitty?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?

Everyone laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's in a meeting.
Don't fight.
Just take care of yourself, Tom.
I'll figure it out.
I'm in better shape than you are.
Maybe they're around the pond somewhere.
I wish I'd known.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain this to you in detail.
I'll talk about it with Tom.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I'll call her tonight.
It's been a crazy year.
Get out of here, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom's never left his home before.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?

It'll take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife isn't sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.

Would you like some more tea?
The nail pierced the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.

All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.

Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.

No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear he wasn't going to do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are kinds of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "The experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher angry, if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
I hope it'll be dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.

In our world, education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.

Why do you want to hurt me so bad?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from duty to Afghanistan, Tom was persecuted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
That won't have any effect.
Don't hang around.
Do you have a real one?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom's suggesting could save us all some time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
They're all left.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love from once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I've got a white horse.
Let's talk about this at lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included at the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We must respect personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
It was a ridiculous mistake.
What do you eat anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to, but he didn't.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
Love me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's nobody like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.

I believe you're being honest.
Come play with us.
Did you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.

There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't get away with it.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.

Did I ask you?
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
It took four kilos of gold to pay for the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to put numbers in his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to believe me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man you touch?
Will you talk to Tom about me?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak plainly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income has dropped by ten percent.
It can be hard to get around an unknown field.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long review, I ended up making stuff at random.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're down.
Can you talk to me?
Turn down the TV.
I'm wearing short sleeve T-shirts.
Old people often talk to themselves.

I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about that.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad for lying.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with it, porn will be made with it.
Canada is a country-mom hockey on the ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving up so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's been jogging before breakfast every morning.
This time he's going into town.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
Stop watching TV and start studying.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
I didn't do it either.
How much does a beer bottle cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's too bad!
I'm sick of arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train's over your head.
Come see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
I was pretending I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.
He wouldn't let anyone else in the room.
Better with soap than by force.
There's trouble waiting for you.
There is no word "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you'd be busy.
Could that be true?
Be quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
The ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
I've been told nothing.
Tom didn't make friendships as easy as Mary.
I assumed this would happen months ago.
Bad weather stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You're so fat.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one's as fast as you are.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go in that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered with your foolish business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch to Haugesundu will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects Mary and I set something up.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
I'm just not gonna do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid addicts on the colour editor.
I liked that guy.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you being so paranoid?
Tom was spinning around the room, not able to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She's wondering how it's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to interfere?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic fingers moves, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
Strong winds broke a lot of branches off the trees last night.
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The path to a man's heart leads across his stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house was built of bricks.
I didn't write this.
I can't help feeling partially responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take some.
Come inside.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning on doing.
To join the choir, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom's asleep.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom cooks for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for a human being to always favour the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of planned stuff for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was present at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stubborn, insensitive children can sometimes grow up into sociopaths.
I'd like to have her at your place.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you pass me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We're all working too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning very quickly.
You're different.
She's an unknown hater of others.
This will make our work much easier.
He loves football.
The monks used to play tennis in the convents.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the meds.
Who's Tom?
I was wondering if I might be dreaming.
It changes all the time.
No one's going anywhere.
Drive to work from an hour and a half.
It's the right thing to do.
Your time will be here soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us believe that such views are pure madness.
Someone might get hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend the passport.
I think Tom got the fatter ending.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Look into this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
It's so sad.
How clever!
Briefly speaking, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
I've played the piano a long time ago, so I'm still a little bit good at it.
Is this your cup or your sisters?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He wrote to himself that he had to work in the garden two hours a day.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're right completely.
Come sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this right now.
Time to split up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The implementation of the meeting is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have a meeting tonight.
A man hopes as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Oh, do you remember the one she sent to you when she asked you to give you pictures of Apple's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a criticism to Mecca." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from it?" "I realized Phillips's screwdriver is convincing, but not seductive; and that Reiti is paying the things I think she should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years old as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom will wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm the one who's supposed to do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He set the torch on fire before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of you bitching.
Get out!
We've got two televisions.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm looking into it right now.
She has achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much from what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes by train.
Two sides will be making speeches this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw a cat.
I'm in a cast.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That needs help.
Defend yourselves.
He caught a cab to the hospital.
Can you juggle?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.
Tom's untapped.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
I'm being honest, I don't know.
That's your election.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the dogs.
Maybe she has other plans?
Patient's out.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I that different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to leave.
The eagle is the king of birds.
The fire hit the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you've got this all wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm grounded.
The cat lay out all the way through the sunlight that penetrated the window.
On foot or on a bike, you go to school?
Tom's not much happier.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
I left Tom 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon, her beautiful face and her young body, is of passing value.
I saw the mouse.
Try.
The two countries have negotiated a peace treaty.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me right now.
They seemed to know what they were looking for.
You tried.
We'll just follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That needs a dream.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm used to it.
I've got a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll keep you posted.
I've been instinctively responding.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked in the chest and barefoot.
She's just out of my league.
What exactly are we looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are tax-paid services.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Today things are very different.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's look at it again.
Sounds like treason to me.
That's what we need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under drawings, he wrote, "Take the hot dogs!"
Drive slow.
What a man you are!
Twice, cut once!
How long has Tom had him?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggested.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto, why this language, because at the same time it's beautiful and stimulating our learning, the international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world, and besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn, and if you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get any sleep?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't fight.
She got her fingers all over the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed it to the sky.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You never make it in time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make progress.
Tom was so scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We've got to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you close your eyes.
Are we all here?
I'm dizzy.
Tom was moaning from the pain.
All or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign it.
You're embarrassing him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two orange juice bottles.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
I'm being honest, I don't know.
I hope he'll be okay.
The wind's calmed down.
I have a mirror in my bedroom from floor to ceiling.
I wish I remembered that.
Don't make a sound.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The check-check festival took place in Latvia.
We are who we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one comes to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security's been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy talks like he's an adult.
The carrots cost three dollars.
My motorcycle's new.
Tom told me today he loves me.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?
I've tried that before.
Go upstairs.
No parking allowed there.
Bigom wound.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how you play it.
How long did you stay?
Tom's a passionate cyclist.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom's family moved around a lot.
We liked the food, especially the fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't dawdle.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom just happened to be built.
Is he a handsome man, Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He's got another one.
And I want to see the ocean.
Don't even write!
Who doesn't?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
Tom's fingernails.
He was a man who never hesitated to stand up.
It's probably up to the periodic appearance of the venison coming because floating ice from Siberia can carry polar foxes on them.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I've been having memory problems lately.
I'm Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's official business.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Is he your new boyfriend?
Forget him.
I agreed to buy it.
What do the papers say?
The temperature of the sun's surface is about 6000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Sami asked a lot of questions about Islam
If we leave now, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom gonna sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She went through her hair with her fingers.
Tom's working hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says there are four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom says.
I'm starving.
Don't fight.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of getting old.
I don't agree with you completely.
There's a lot of answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I love watching you dance.
It's hard to apply what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurting?
Ole, the oldest eel in the world has just died.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put a collage on the top shelf.
Have you seen anyone there?
My father's so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know how to paint like that.
I'll try to find them.
I was having trouble solving that problem.
I don't know what's not, still or just before, any good, but several times when I've been trying to get into the website today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually seem happy?
I went there with my own will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
The prison fugitive was caught quickly again.
Everything seemed possible at the time.
I sent a map to Tom's college.
I have memory problems these days.
Tom may not make it to the meeting.
Tom died almost at the same time.
The judge was banging a hammer.
They also found that the same miscalculation was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed for a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't dawdle.
He should be able to change.
Does Tom have cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended outside the contracted period, the proportional addition of the rent will be calculated.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imaginations be at will.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom keeps over 80% of what he earns.
Are we safe now?
We are who we are.
He's not honest at all.
Wonderful!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You've helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be that way.
I come when I can.
Don't get away with it.
It's not gold all that shines.
Are we all here?
We must focus on our virtues.
How fast!
Faith can move mountains.
I don't give up!
Tom fell off the truck while feeding the reindeer.
Tom became a swimmer even though his parents wore it they wanted.
I think we've met before.
I've made mistakes before.
Can you tell us more?
Tom knows it's over.
It's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom drinks a lot.
I'm not from around here.
Tom was sitting on the grass under the coconut tree.
Everyone laughed.
I'm more tough than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little beat up.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom's got the blinker on.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Is everyone crazy?
What do you eat anyway?
He's so weird.
This is where I draw the line.
Pay attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
They all ran away.
I've already written to Tom.
Tom had to rewrite the composition.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't get involved in your fucking business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Was I really that happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His little brother is a famous football player.
I was too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Are we going to see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
It's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what it is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It'd be hard.
She's making him meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of the watcher.
How are you feeling today?
That needs a reason.
Okay, what's the secret?
Are we starting soon?
Did you see me dance?
I'm starving.
He lives around in a white house.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Tom managed to escape just in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You just got shot.
You're the reason I'm here.
I'm not rich enough.
Seniors should pay for their hats and dresses.
Do I see it?
Don't move!
It was all Tom's fault.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan anyway?
You should be here at the latest at half-one.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
I saw a hippo in the zoo.
I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
He's a man of his word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two parts.
Murilla's 20 now.
Did you eat anything?
Did you go to see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
The window's made of glass.
Are you done yet?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll feel better in a few days.
That's what Tom would like us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
Tom's a bookworm.
I changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would love to be motivated, creative, thinking creatures only if they had that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
That's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could sleep over.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we got lucky.
Don't talk.
Let's have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Polish hospital.
We'll run in the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly injured.
If you need help, tell me.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
First one leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 8:25.
That was a little weird.
Does that read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
It was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now the word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't help himself.
It's time for bed.
Tom wanted to have a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the fan?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How are you feeling?
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
A lot of predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm sorry.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man with many talents.

Tom's better now than he's had before.
Tom and Mary differ like heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who's gonna win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would be even wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment to him. One such desire is also a desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of eternal life, and he would yearn for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car by myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.

I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?

Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's average.
What are you planning on doing this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Beethoven wrote nine symphony.
I'll hurry.

They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
You're sending a message to Mary?
I'll save you a spot in the front row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What's your conclusion?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals have unquestionably tortured animals.
How long are you gonna be mad at us?
How important is that?
Shall we have an aperitif?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
I like to play music written by my friends.
Tom confessed to that.
It's hard working with you.
Tom got fat.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
It takes a few old houses to crash.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
Tom's very careful.
When will you leave?
This report isn't exactly well written.
She points out that this government's last move has multiple meanings.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost the whole face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh country in the world in size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.

I wish I could have thought of that.

I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not an essay problem, it's all these devastating questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
He's here this weekend.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were there for me.
Try this.
Clean it up.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do it either.
Let's take another look.

We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car by myself.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into that.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled a thicker end.
There's no match for him.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a rookie.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom's not getting away.
I'd go.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you remember can help.
That's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye like you are, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
No free lunch.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I feel it.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He learns by doing what he does.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
Everything's quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to school for graphic design.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape right on time.
I've had enough of this.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take some.
He's talking about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think it's OK.
Whatever do you think?
You changed my life.
The reaction isn't always the best way to work.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated with a proportional part of the annual interest fee.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory, it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
Almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the file name before trying to restore deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.

I'm not married to Tom.
Tom's one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom's been getting ready for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't need to throw rocks in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
- Don't clump.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do it.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I got a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I passed every test.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.

I can't believe all this.

And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as a shipment?
What do you suggest?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Look out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They moved slowly forward.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't shine.
It's blue on you.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
A ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy little girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You have a busy day ahead of you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do it either.
Did you pass the exams?
I strongly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom was scared of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
The knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
Today's your daughter's birthday.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing mistake.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom's got a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got bad hair.
I've seen enough for now.
That's what I hate.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs did you write?

Don't rush.
You can study, regardless of your age.
He dedicated his life to achieving the vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?

How is this your fault?
How did I miss this?
What do I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Nationality is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing electronic devices.
You're losing.
I'm ready, bro.
Please leave as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we understand this.
We all have to stand up to this.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.
Throw me some sugar, please.
Come quick!
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever hung a YouTube video?

She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.

Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary used walking sticks that helped her to climb and fall on her journey.

Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep your mouth shut all the time?
He's gone.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What's the purpose of life?
Drive the pole.
My right hand is numb.
I don't know anything about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
I need you to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I redesigned it.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.

We'll try it your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve me to congratulate you.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of it.
Could you pass me the water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more hard.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us have seen Tom do it.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
You're embarrassing her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I wasn't interested in that.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet's a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
What did you find out?
You were made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipfeler.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a little something.
Control yourself.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things are gonna happen.
A few trees fell during a storm in our vicinity.
I'm sure I've seen her before.
Everyone smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I give up.
Tom seemed angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll have work tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
That helps us a lot.
I filled the glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the village.
The rumor spread fast.
Am I that different?
Tom pulled out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did was a lot of help.
I've never seen that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Is that why you're angry?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
The cost will soon grow.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.

We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that a yes or a no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for the day.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, there is a general measure of caution to avoid infection in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.

The room was dark.
He's going home.

I can't fix the car by myself.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips turned into a sinister smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for course went down when her favorite lecturer moved away.

Tom's always very nice.
I barely closed my eye.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom was named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
What makes you think that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She wrapped her hair with papillots.
He was released from military service.
They're bleeding to my right.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play many times.
You tried.
I'm taking you dancing.
Tom might have tried to convince Mary to do it.
She's made from an elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He was formerly a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the large masses.
I'm terrified.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question of what's best, because it's always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to perfect.
The house burned to the ground before the firemen arrived.
The months of the most rain are May, June, July and August.

I've already written part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the papers.
It has to do with what...
It can hardly be about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done washing the dishes?
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Tom's gonna pay.
The hunting season is over.
I like the cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their native talents.
I'd go.
You're very rude.

That's a good idea.
Everything you have will someday have you.
As busy as Tom is, he never forgets that our email to his shirt at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have one of those?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad weather, the plane was late.
Look into them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'll take a nap in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alco-test, before he was sent to laboratory testing.

Look around.
It's been a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was watching it up close.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue our discussion.
How much do I get?
I want to be with you.
This was sophisticated and painted in a person so strange, cruel and stubborn that a little who dared work closely with him.

Check everyone.
Tell us a ghost story.
Check everyone.
Session's over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm miserable.
I can't wait until Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut the cheese into small pieces or small cubes.

I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused real interference.

The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I need to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.

I called him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's blushing.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA was rotting to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of that.
Ataturk was born in 1881, in Thessaloniki.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Is that what you told Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, a crossover with it will eventually happen.
Tom's good at French.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.
He never got over the death of his son.
I'm just doing my duty.
They all sat down.
If you have nothing else to do, then the number of the Greek island.
She's always wearin' the dreary clothes.
Is that gonna work out soon?
Mary put a ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Who's Tom?
Tom seemed older and mature than the other boys.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
The gifts of Visunu are called Visunuans; the worshippers of Shiva are the Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown.
I've completely lost track of my thoughts.
I never repented of what I did.
I'm sure.
Do you speak Roma?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all along.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things people make I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I refused Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all limits.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Apparently, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom reads a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move over.
We should be studying.
We have no other choice.
When this is the time, it's best to sit at home and not go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on the power of observation, Tom couldn't describe any images from his living room wall, even though he lived there for two years.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
Everyone's holding their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I love watching you work.
I hope we visit Beijing, too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did someone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half-one.
I'm still a little tired.
To seek to maximise his own interest, happiness or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I don't sing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes out of here.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is nowhere near as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree we knocked down and found out it was 30 years old.
I'll see you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still looks shaken.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
I'm remodulating.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're scared of me.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one's ever helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience with this job.
Can you help us?
You want to chill out?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud that the Serb, with their historical highest achievements -- is the massacre of the chiefs and genocides?
Do you know you're defuseing the bomb?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom's lost his senses.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom will take a look.
I've got a cell phone that just shows the error message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone's smiling.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can tell Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find the tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one has died... yet.
Can we, people, protect the grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to get you drunk.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They sell sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank Tom for your help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and quietness, are real masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never mention this again.
You're not allowed in that room.
We have two kids.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo at half past eleven.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you some steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Look out!
Tom couldn't get any evidence to back up his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad temper.
I'm on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a really bad day.
The whole country is talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does she love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm a mess.
I was happy yesterday.
By the way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now is not the best time.
He's not a kid anymore.
I try to run a futon at least twice a week.
My education made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had trouble solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
One moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "No P" and/or "Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
It's an exception.
Tom came in a little earlier today than usual.
I could eat a horse.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which is easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought a newspaper and read them on the train on his way to work.
I've got house spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do it either.
Snorri Sturluson's stories, besides the fact that Christianity in Norway has spread by violence.
Answer me right now.
Make yourself at home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant gold necklace with hearts is a necklace that will shake your world.
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It's raining hard.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
The dinner was held at the White House.
I need you to leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do the right thing from the first time.
Marie jumped into the river from the window.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary are always walking holding hands.
Where was I wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another example.
Tom's still got a little time.
Toothless is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth must be told.
Look how much it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
I always eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made us know he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the quality of water is checked once a year in pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard when people have to distract you from one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your looks, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could've done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a big mess.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of the barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in a very long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Would you mind if I cut you off for a moment?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good intention.
I've thought about it before.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Do you want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom's seriously hurt in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students were in a meeting.
My mother's not like the other mothers.
He cancelled his meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he was gonna do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe that Mary is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote in these elections.
I'm sure you'll do well.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make way.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's going to come with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 per cent of the Norwegian population is being supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
That's perfectly normal.
It's said that a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he slept very much.
I never thought of that.
Keep your voice down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
That wouldn't have liked it.
I'm really curious.
Tom's parked twice.
Good morning.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
There's islands on the sea.
I've never had trouble sleeping.
I didn't see anything.
Is there any other possibility?
The amount for the job and the interest in invested capital were several million.
I can't wait tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about it.
Are you coming to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea rises, the sea of men.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitations and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom shut down the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works about nine hours continuously.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
They couldn't all hear what Tom said.
I'll shower.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left leg today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that goes public.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should take the test again.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
Europeans took advantage of other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That pisses me off a lot.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I wish I could have thought of that.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw the cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom's strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us are hot with potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do it.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lezilebovic.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, having become a victim of conspiracy, he was convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Can you tell Tom I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
One foot in the grave
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's as crazy as electricity.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks a lot different than it used to be.
Why are rabbits ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
It's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things in walking.
This one's so cool.
I was just enjoying myself.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Keda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I know how to keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this paper.
We hate Tom.
This one's so cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a little longer.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could put up with it.
I just want to get out of the way.
Don't let him get away with this good chance.
Be careful.
She's in her first year of college.
I was looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My liquid knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for showing my, often mutual contradictory, emotion.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
I'm sorry I always bother you.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
How do we stop this from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
You ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right upstairs.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
As most 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music pieces for the phagot.
Secretary of the United States John Kerry broke his right thigh bone in a cycling accident in France on Sunday.
Where there's a lot of grandmas, the kilos are children.
Sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were amazing.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are clogged.
Have you fully recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loudly.
Don't move!
The accident was filmed by an observer.
Did I drop it?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the detour is in New York.
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxury dishes, will be more modest this year.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does it.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often child molesters.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves his words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's a living truth.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now's a great time to buy one.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom came out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve yourself.
I've exaggerated.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You don't have to judge a man by his looks.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I was pretending I didn't know what was going on.
They'll be making speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
Tom told me he wasn't gonna tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are asleep.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and split up a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
Phase one is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Do you learn French in your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
It's important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to nobody liking me.
The brakes are clogged.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite the song he wrote when he was 13.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow's a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come take a look.
Tom really looks familiar.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go swim with Tom a little bit.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A female chiffoner isn't complete without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
There's nothing else to do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's worked his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom's gonna live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it all wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
As little as we know of her origin, at least we can be sure that the pilot is Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with typing machines.

In this phase of world history, there is not one such thing in America as independent printing. You know that and I know it. Among you there is no one who dares to write his honest opinion, and when he wrote it, but in advance would know that it will never appear in the press. I get regular my salary to keep my honest opinion outside the newspaper for which I do. Many of you are also similar to paid for such things, and any one of you who would be so crazy to write what he really thinks would find himself out, on the street, looking for another job. that I have allowed my right opinion to appear only in one issue of the newspaper I do, I would get fired from work for less than 24 hours. The job of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie out, to be defile, that I have allowed myself in front of our own leg, that I do not know that I know about my own people'sage and that I know that I've never done.

Please hurry.

I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.

Mary read the entire manual of work from 321 pages in her breath.

What can I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't go on like that in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
He's learning hard.
It takes a lot of imagination when trying to add a new sentence here.

Tom took his ukulele and started singing.
Will we see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst thing that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try it.
This is a mess.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think she's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
It's so light.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
The lie got him into trouble when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his age.
I really like the members of my team.
What have you both done?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I got a rock in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.

I saw Tom die.
You're in better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll try to find them.
I can lose my license.

I know exactly what I have to do.
Tom's on his way.
We'll let you know as soon as we know.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really that happy?
The fuse's burned down.
I can't resist anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom knows he's knocking really fast.
She sometimes writes to her son.

I think it's best to be nice.
Africa is a cradle of humanity.

I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do it.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's fast.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I'm used to doing it.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I've met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think again.
How's Tom doing at work?
That's what a doctor needs.
I want to be human again one day.
Why is that so complicated?

I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always the way it is.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom about me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
The intelligence satellite is a military satellite capable of monitoring many activities on earth, listening to communications lines, registering the radar system's operating frequency...
I asked you last night.
You're very pretty.

I thought I was stabbed.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I thought you were going to Boston on a bus.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could've used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs over the weekend.
You don't know me.
How's Tom and Mary?
Doesn't mean something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't hang around.
Where did you find this knife?
They need you to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope that Tom's predictions will come true.
If we'd gotten here sooner, maybe we could've saved Tom.
Why are you leaving?
The gold is in the green woods.
I'm scared.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.

Maybe he'll come see us tonight.
Air conditioning's broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
Would you like some more mashed potatoes?
And then something amazing happened.
This project, of course, required budget rebalancing.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very quickly.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
I forgot to pay the rent.
I didn't do it either.

Did you wash the dishes?
Come closer.
Tom's not the right man for that job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just messing with you.

Tom could convince Mary to do it.
Was I really that happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What did you do today?
How much am I gonna take?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't eat just one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I'll give you what you want.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm leaving early today.
How adventurous!
Tell me what that is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get lost!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you acting childish?
We could've saved Tom if we'd only arrived a few minutes earlier.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.

You were offended about it, even though it didn't mean anything at all, and it was supposed to be something funny on my part, but you didn't see it like that.
Who's got time for this?
I'm still sleepy.
Tom's a dater.
My stomach hurts.
We calculated that we could get to that place within two weeks.
I passed all the tests.
Mary works as a waitress at a nearby bar.
Let me explain.
I forgot my baby surveillance device.
She reacted to it.
I'm naked.
What have you got there?
So, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher says.
Have a nice week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views on sports.
I'm coming to save you!
I'm wearing a flannel pajamas.
I'm scared to death.
There was only one small problem.
I'm all alone right now.
That was terrible.
I wasn't at all confident.
Never say never.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
The planes are landing at the airport.
It's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always seems unhappy.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's going too far.
I'm very happy for that.
Tom turned to go.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put it.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom's gonna be able to help us get through this.
I'm already paid.
They're all messed up.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We have to be realistic.
Don't stare.
They happened to hear some suspicious activity in the chiroprazzi indicating that the bear smelled their food.
I've been everywhere in Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't stare.
You asked for it yourself.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my quarters.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm devastated.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's class laughed at her for her clothes.
Everyone's either gone through it or gone through it.
I'll get right on it.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy walking along the road to the walks in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Did you see that?
Are you busy here?
I've chosen between two possibilities.
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up at half past seven.
We didn't do it.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, pass me the salt.
How's Tom doing?
Be careful.
Do you have a paper that I can write by?
He was walking down the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw a cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of Christmas's book sale, and it's hardly gonna get a book thrown out of position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a noise?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me one more reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I'd known.
Get changed.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared in advance.
I don't count on it.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you anything you want.
The girls wore weed skirts and had flowers around their necks.
Can you call a doctor?
Tom's the only one in the family.
He may have already left.
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure a table for cross budgets, insert and use plain tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'm staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Call me anytime, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I've been reformed.
What happens next time?
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was very nice.
This sad story was written at the time Tom was exiled.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried it.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your husband left you?
Can you prove it?
Dead end.
It's so easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I'd rather not be involved in that right now.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been terrible.
I'll loan you a work book if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as me.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where do we meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
Shteglic is a very interesting bird.
The relationship between the personality and the blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
I did check some things.
I don't sing.
I'd like to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
A working group dealing with data transfer, led by Ben Mani, will hold a meeting on 14 January 1999.
Some say that if you step on a rainworm, it'll start raining.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Tom knows he's knocking very fast.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give yourself up like that.
I'll give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
I might need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm tough than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
Tom bought a newspaper and read them on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be OK.
What do you call that?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no policy set.
Write down what I'm saying.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom winked.
I didn't set foot outside today.
Did they tell you why?
Can you spell your name for me?
Look at this.
She was saving her life.
I think we should call a doctor.
You're awfully early today.
We got Tom on the job.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't happy with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big fan of football.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary makes a living sewing.
Could you pass me the water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elemental, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here to pick you up.
I'm intrigued.
What do you want?
The drugs don't usually need to be mixed with alcohol.
Did you see who that was?
When I woke up, it was snowing.
Some people no matter what age they are, do not lose their beauty.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty amazing.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Look into her.
She was dressed in red.
What does a fellow scientist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you fully recovered?
We had a big fight.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
Keep working.
Hope is lost when you're experiencing a difficult situation and a pointless brake.
I was laughing.
The new constitution will not solve Egypt's problems.
Solar energy is a pure energy source.
I thought Tom wasn't doing what he had to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dance?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clear?
They haven't woken up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We have no other choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking of going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really that individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done making your house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialty?
I'm twice Tom's age.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've never camped.
There are a lot of dishonest people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
The Hungarian language is not easy, but it's wonderful.
I think so, too.
I prefer a tent with a stormy blanket, along with crossbars for wind stability and snow applications, and this has to be a two-layer tent.
Tell Tom I said hi.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we going to meet?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm touched.
Tom's been fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is significantly better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me when I'm in my office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's interrogating the patient.
Tom passed his drink.
This is justice.
I could lose my pension.
She's in a bad mood.
I've always known that.
Don't shine.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been on a camping trip.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the boss in their house.
Let's hope you're right.
We split up on the corner.
Are you mad about that?
I baked my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, it's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did it turn out to me?
Did you sleep?
They tried hard in court.
Is there a reason you're keeping these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
I have to go now.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started learning French last year.
Tom was sitting on a bench all day writing postcards.
Aren't you going to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
Money story.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I parked twice.
I've never seen that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I'm about to come looking for you.
He's leading a busy life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got the right attitude.
Anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to a breast-shaped deformation if they rotate to the hip.
Where did you find the keys?
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little dizzy.
I saw the bus.
Tom's wise enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports for you to take a closer look at them.
I'm not as rich as we'd like.
Get on board.
Tom's still pissed.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria put on her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet is not your personal army.
I could go with you.
Sadly, he moved from the almighty God to become a powerful, filthy, small and insignificant man in the corner of a small province in a vast empire.
We should do better.
The weather forecast says tomorrow afternoon will rain.
Tom's a real gentleman.
I saw a snake.
It's useless.
What planet are you from?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Okay, we got a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom's very patient.
Everything changes.
Tom knows where the wind blows from.
Women are the most beautiful in a man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is precharged.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom loves it the most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
Yesterday I finished learning the Esperant at Duoling.
Tom attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right away.
I did what I could for him.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom listens because he's convincing.
My suitcase hasn't packed yet.
Did you sleep?
The readers were in pain, waiting at least three months before they got the answer.
Do you know anyone who passed the exam last year?
Mary took the liberty of traveling.
They live on their high feet.
Tom's out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen this guy somewhere before.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
You don't support me very much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's everything. He's just not honest.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's human sin, forgiveness is divine.
I passed all the tests.
I just needed a little time.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
A man dreams, God determines.
Tom was wearing black jeans.
It must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this place taken?
It was just like that.
Add more water.
Tom counts the change.
All parking spaces are full.
This is my brother, Tom.
Use the device until it warns you to charge the battery and then fill it for 5 hours to achieve maximum capacity.
Tom's still a bachelor.
You're becoming careless.
No, don't do that.
I had dogs when I was little.
Tom was with a girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I'm not gonna ask Tom to do it.
They were all standing.
I used to pretend I didn't understand.
Would you talk to Tom?
Can you pass me the remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now it's time to enjoy yourself.
Has he met his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my dogs?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually have for breakfast?
Am I that different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice Tom's age.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
The new engine test will be done today.
Come and sit down.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay off the money he owes.
All things must pass.
Come on, get in the truck.
I've never seen that before.
I don't have a wish for that.
I think Tom was great.
I have a headache.
Tom looks a little gross.
I wish my wife knew how to cook.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck over something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
You've taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the Earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you've lost 10 pounds.
You disappoint me.
We'll get right on it.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The fuse's burned.
Are we safe now?
Tom says he's gonna do it one day.
By the way, what's your address?
This one's a mess.
She's wearing a gold chain around her neck.
The electronics provide a multi-speed and simple adjustment of air flow.
Have you heard that he's finally back home?
During the clear days, we see Mount Fuji in the distance.
That's your election.
They're sitting at the table.
It's a multiphase process.
I thought you were very generous.
Tom could have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It doesn't work on me.
The assembly is disbanded.
Tell me what you wrote.
It never occurred to me that someone would come up with something like that.
Tom was very friendly to me.
I can't agree with you.
My father fixed a broken chair.
Let's move the closet.
Tom dropped me off at the airport.
You do, don't you?
I'm trying.
I wrote a song about Tatoebi.
I need to catch the train.
I'm not in any hurry.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat at the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever listened to such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He kicked the ball in the goal!
It's a big day today, son!
We were filled with joy in waiting.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'll forgive you, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Wipe your lips with a napkin.
The free library Haskell and Opera House were built at the border between Canada and the United States.
It's very important to rest properly.
You've disappointed me.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Karin is Austrian.
I think I understand you.
Tom's personal assistant has a personal assistant.
It's sitting alone.
You have to make a decision.
Every time we talk about it, he makes me work adrenaline.
Tom's always very nice.
It takes courage.

Stop smoking.
Do you know what that thing is?
Just tell Tom I called.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
They gave water to their horses.
My father gave me a lot of money.
You can talk to Tom.
Is it all settled now?
Nothing's free.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.

I wasn't too surprised.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Did you write the report?
Tom turned on the heating.
I want to know why.
We'll catch up with you.
I don't usually buy anything from the Internet.
Someone was here.
- Did you write in the living room today?
That's the best of everything I've ever heard.
Do you know anyone there who's talking to Urda?
Tom was shot three times.
Come pick me up.
Tom's laughing muffled.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Tom could explain that.
Let me help you.
Are you a baseball fan?
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't see anything.
We all received a blessing for the blessing of the almighty of her mercy.
As far as I'm concerned, I still don't understand.
Tom's thinking the same thing.
I never lend anyone books or CDs.
That was kind of weird.

My kids rely on me.
I beg you to reconsider.
He can be treated.
Don't be a pain in the ass.
When they experienced the French Revolution, citizens became free people, freed traditions and churches, praised freedom, equality, and brotherhood.
I didn't think it was appropriate.
Tom offered to help when everything seemed to have gone completely wrong.
Translation or not is the moral choice of translators. Sometimes things sound better if they stay in the language they are created in.
Look what I grew up in!
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
I'm pathetic.
How long have you lived here?
Do you think the situation will improve?
Whoever doesn't take chances doesn't get it.
Don't stare.

Okay, I get it.
What are you looking for?
Are we all here?
Scientists believe that finding always comes as a thunder from the clear sky.

Don't yell.
The ship disappeared without a trace.
It's precise.
I've never seen that before.
Did you enjoy watching the night game last night?
Their closeness was mysterious, considering they only met three days ago.
I've done that before.
What year was your car made?
I tried to be nice.
Don't sing.
It would have been good if I had put on another layer.
What did I say, brother?
The keys are in the cipher.
That's all we can do.
Are those your new shoes?
Under what name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where the hell have you been?
She smiled.
Tom just couldn't do it.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I have some news.
The odds were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was discouraging.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
You're making Tom nervous.
Keep working.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I'm not doing the dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens unless his dream precedes him.
I tried to be nice.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom's doing a very good impression on the way Mary speaks.
Can you solve this problem?
Some of my friends are smoking.
You're my princess.
You'll miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's gonna wait.
I guess that's what Tom thinks.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
Excuse me?
Everyone changes.
You want some more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
Buy a liter of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning on coming to his party.
Did you see me play?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom is very idioscrian.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any harm.
I was the only man in the tourist group, the rest of them made Arabs living in Istanbul.
Look into it.
Tom's not the right person to work.
We have to get better.
They asked for an increase in salary.
Let me see your recipe.
Tom's here to help.
Sometimes family gatherings spread through generations.
It's all because it's upside down.
Tom thinks fast.
The comments have to be about the subject.
Don't get kidnapped.
The programme sets conditions for project development and implementation.
We should go again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me a spoon.
Can I find you on Facebook?
I tried to be nice.
It would be confusing.
We're here.
You can sit next to me.
That's what pulled the handle.
Tom was a great manager.
Everybody taps.
All you have to do is practice.
Have you ever milked a cow?
There's a lot of orange bakers on the river.
All you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.

What's this all about?
Tom counted the change.
I studied hard when I was in school.
I said no tom.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert mirage.
When are you gonna get to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try it your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one was looking.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could be lying.
Good luck.
I've never regretted it.
Tom was as angry as a lynx.
Tom could have a point.
Am I welcome here?
What did you both do?
Don't yell.
What an experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done here?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends were teasing her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.

Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.

Which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, to say the least, a disaster.
We have to save money to buy a new car.
Bad things are gonna happen.
I thought you'd already taken care of it.
What age is your car?
You have to believe it's possible that he'll change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to use it?
I could go there now.
They were all cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have any perfume?
Don't play the monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
He's making such a face to wish you'd hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we were doing.
When shouting doesn't help, shout louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Tom arrived on time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was reckless.
Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm having someone do it for me.
You're still unexperienced.
We're gonna have a great time.
Not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot in here.
Have you fully recovered?
Tom was wearing black jeans and a white shirt.
The book cost five bucks.
Is it that simple?

Drive slow.
Tom must have had a key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cat, please, don't turn over.
Just give me a chance.
What are you smiling at?
How many people were there?
Everyone's quiet.
Pass me the sugar, please.
I'm amazed.
I want a sword!
Don't talk.
Extraordinary!

Come on.
What do you mean by that?

Go upstairs.
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach you how to write.
The mile depends on the conditions on the road.

Could we order now?
We can't stop here.

Hey, give me a chance.
There's also an ethical question that's being asked about this.
It just happened again.
Everyone survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than I do.
I don't have anything coming in my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my kids.

Anyone can get lice.
Tom wouldn't let me answer Mary's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.

I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking the day off.
Do you blame me?
It ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston on a bus.
Tom's still got a little time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new at this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No.
That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You were spying on me.
The pen I write belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary stayed good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom muffled his smile.
I'm scared.
In what name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with lots of new houses.
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wig.
I thought I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.

Jumi is one of my friends.
He just needed a little time.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Maria started taking off her clothes.
Up and down.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
I'm hard on this.
You're underestimating me.

The police didn't reject the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.

I totally disagree with you.
Back off.
Let me do it again.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in one day.
It had a very different effect than it intended.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody laughs.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all gone.
The book was sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At first sight, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I don't doubt he'll make it.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother's dad enjoys the tea ceremony.
She smiled.
They've fooled everyone.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.

Does Tom have a key?
Tom's getting ready.
You always do.
In chess, there are situations where it is worth sacrificing the figure to gain advantage on the long term.
Young children should learn to feel compassion for animals.
You haven't finished yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother likes music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a sketch of your house.
Tom put his drink down.
I'm pretty shocked about this.
The stove's empty.
Tom decided on the opposite.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer that.
If you did it for me, it would help a lot.
He was naked in the chest and barefoot.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
I'm a little worried right now.
What's in there, Tom?
Help yourself.
I'm completely broke.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a minute?
Don't let it get in your head.
My right hand is numb.
That's enough!

Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!

Everybody's asleep.

Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Union, the great and multi-national, in the great Tver region, in the size of several English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What have you done to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned how to knock on a typewriter, and he told his teacher he shouldn't learn to write his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go outside and eat.
Can I talk to you outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I did a good act.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this planned for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was clearly upset.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I really that happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear that someone bought a thousand-dollar hat.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's worked his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what they both like.

What's your name?
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this distraction.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
I want to be a swimmer.
Shall we see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have many friends.
We don't know what tomorrow brings.
What first instrument did you learn to play?
I'm amazed.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan.
You took my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would want to go camping with us next weekend?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Drive safe.
Did I ask you?
How long has Tom been staying?
People tell me things.
Cheers!
Tom's in his pajamas.
Did Tom believe your story?
I was very tired so I went to sleep early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's that going?
Don't argue with me.

I want to feel important.
We'd give anything so it didn't happen.

Don't rush.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'm leaving early today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, the chance to work on a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and prospects for progress.
I doubt I'm the only one who's noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Pass me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get your driver's license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Is everything settled now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is still only a product of human thought independent of experience, is so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's an honest person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
He took that risk.
His wife patched his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
To change the red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in the mushrooms sauce for tonight.
I'm always cranky.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movie.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You're getting fat.
They're not mine.
I double the prices.
Could you do that?
A video of the interview was made and published online.
Tom was drunk and drowned his grief after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we rest for a while?
Go take a look.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Is that what you think?
I didn't do it either.
Do you have anything to report?
I say it all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom dropped a muffled breath.
There's a lot of work to be done before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when you speak fast.
It'll be half three soon.
They'll know.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Zurich is considered one of the major financial centers.
That's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get away with it.
It's not getting any worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go in that room.
"Do you feel better?" "No, I'm worse."
Everything is fleeting, but beautiful memories live.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
Which one's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a big fight.
It was a drop that spilled the glass.
He doesn't like us.
It would've saved time if we'd gone down Park Street.
A cop arrested him for drunk driving.
We're gonna be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people like it.
We all have a price.
That's what gave it an idea.
I got lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Run over any obstacles with this truck monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and e-mails to her friends.
He always wears dark clothes.

I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men stay kids their whole lives.
Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Haven't I taught you anything?
Why do you ask?
It's big.
As fast as it is, it's also delicious.
Come sit next to me.
I found him a book.
I could barely hide my bitterness because of her impudence.
Buter is made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's getting better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss him.
I passed the exam!
Let us help you.
The knife is very sharp.
Please don't yell.
Does he still have a fever?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
