Members of the Wells National Assembly are concerned that they "look like maps"
Some of the members of the congregation are amazed by the proposal to change their name to the MWP (Article of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the congregation to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this can be a subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party is concerned that "he rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: the Welsh twp means "witness/stupid", and pwp means "how".
A Plaid member said the party was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party is "free of mind" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "map" (an. Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "U".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any words to appoint members of the congregation, of course, will make the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales of 2017 gave Wells the power to change his name.
In June, the commission published the results of public consultations on proposals pointing to strong support for the appointment of the congregation as the Veliki Parliament.
On the matter of the name of members of the assembly, the commission prefers members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultation.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can cause headaches for the president of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the question of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote was set in an effort to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a right to her territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for a change of name, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shrunk as the Churches in Harlem faced problems
"The historical, old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in another way today," he said.
"The bars are no longer living rooms in neighborhoods where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started."
The churches, he added, can be replaced with residential buildings filled with a type of people who will not help the remaining sanctuary in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and that's why it will speed up the day when these churches are shut down completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move in those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregation of the whites before Harlem became a metropolis of the blacks - the metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists moved in the '30s.
The congregation of black people exercising their faith nearby assumes the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the congregation of blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the sellers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but because Father Johnson's parishioners had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bell of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the major carillon to Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariveter said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part of what has been brought by the church's unscrupulous leaders, and part of the bishopic diocese.
The church board – the church’s governing body, composed of unsuccessful leaders – wrote to the eparchy in July with concern that the diocese "will demand to transfer the expenses" to the church board, although the church board was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the eparchy.
Some members of the parish complained about a lack of transparency by the eparchy.
Sharks hurt a 13-year-old when they dive for lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day of opening the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack happened about seven hours ago near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel declared that he first thought it was an excitement of catching lobster, but then “he realized that he was shouting, ‘ He bit me!
You bit me!’
The whole key bone was visible to him," Hamel said he noticed after he reached the boy.
"I have called everyone out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to a children's hospital to work in San Diego, seduced as a critical condition.
You don't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach savior, Captain Larry Gilles, told a press conference that several weeks earlier a shark was spotted in the area, but decided that the shark was not of a dangerous kind.
Gils added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the chest.
The authorized authorities have closed the beach on the side of the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Gils noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's taking over Booths, Superothers and Debenhams with beauty rafts in the style of stock houses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom weighing 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales declines, large beauty rafts will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and will be presented in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after supermarkets started looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once intended for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said that for the first time they would double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its series of Boutique makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores in Sainsbury, the first to open in Creidon, southern London last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and tending to buy smaller quantities of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets should do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said shops would look more and more like cattle houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after he bought both chains two years ago, which they said increased the sale of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganise its beauty departments and pharmaceuticals ended successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after a disagreement on how to divide profits from chemical goods stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy has emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of Celesio's pharmaceutical stores, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty rafts to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to suit all needs, and attractive environments and suitable locations mean that we are now a mandatory beauty destination that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "frightful" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-pound contract.
Star Peter Jones of Dragons Den has gone "angry" since TV leader Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-pound contract with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand Truly for household products and accessories.
The couple's business is connected to the Goop brand on Gwynet Paltrow.
This 37-year-old director of the morning programme told Instagram he was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, Dragons Den's star, withdrawing from their profitable life-style branding business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "exciting" when television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghemshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- mean that she no longer has time to commit to their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
Business is connected to the Goop brand on Gwynet Paltrow and was told that it would double Willoughby's fortune to estimate 11 million pounds.
As Willoughby, 37, told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his cottages.
A source said: “Truli was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all the affected caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the opening.
There's a warehouse full of products ready for sale in Marlowe's headquarters."
Experts believe that leaving this morning’s guide, one of Britain’s most paid stars, can cost the company millions because of large investments in pillows and candlesticks products, to clothing and household products and because of the potential for further delay.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby needs to become the ambassador of the brand for M&S and will replace Ante McPartlin as head of "I'm A Celebrity" (I'm a star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones yesterday said "We do not comment on his business exploits".
A serious conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media to comment on what some would consider "unpresidential" and because he is so positive for North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump spoke with his voice as a "representer of the news".
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards red tapeling North Korea.
But the negotiations on non-denucularisation have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN's world leaders that the North does not see a "suitable response" from the United States on the early moves of North Korea for disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
"We agree well with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this excellent co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results – finished the missile samples, helped free hostages and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It is easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded arena, we will have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead of him.
Cunami and Indonesian Earthquake Destroyed the Island, and They Lived Hundreds of Lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population was displaced, no elemental disaster was found, a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although "Save the Children" is a team that will travel to Palu, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the Palu situation to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that constantly hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Acech, they are not a common sight in other shores.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn from tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best of times, traveling across many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was improving Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and tracks.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-elections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows, and arrows and other old weapons.
See: Daniel Starge of the Liverpool team equates against Chelsea
Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from losing in the prime minister's goal league in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri passed the ball to the Starj on about 30 yards from Chelsea’s goal, while his team was losing 1 - 0.
He moved the ball to the left before he directed it to the far stasis.
The ball was moving high over the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went through the jumped Kepa Arizabala and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible," said Starj for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I just touched her and didn't think much about it and I just kicked."
Chelsea led 1 - 0 halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The "Blue" attacker put his heel back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before he kicked the ball almost half course, and then sprinted into half of Liverpool.
They quickly submitted with Kovacich in the middle of the field.
He then directed a missile, leading Hazzard into the 16th.
Hazard passed the defense and finned into the network of a remote stasis with a left foot impact beside Alison Becker's Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples in the team phase of the League of Champions at 15.00 on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA League of Europe at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It has been reported that many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into the 7.5 earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was poisoned by a blowout from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds to Grayson Moves on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard some statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but he would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesman that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in an facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene asking where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and as police have said, they will inform the close people of the victim.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no entry was allowed, no exiting the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The tenants are now told that they will pass hours before they can return.
Someone heard a cop tell a man that now the whole area is considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene.
She repeatedly repeats “so terrible. ”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was outside.
A number of police officers stood in the cordon and watched the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or contact anonymous crime fighters at 0800 555 111 quoting a record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament became the latest memory strike in a fight to "prescribe history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell's society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "madness" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, stated: “In the current debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure before the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclass of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestors, Thomas, in the previous century.
The wonderful presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornejcroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many believe, perhaps more in the late years of the 19th century than today, that Cromwell is defending parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it's a completely accurate play is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid 17th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually distinctive figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A pig-killer ripped and killed a Chinese farmer
Pig attacked and killed a farmer on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only after the name "Juan", was found dead with a broken artery, clothed in blood near the cognac market in Liupansui in the province of Gicou, South China, Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pig farm pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xinning in the province of Kinghai, China.
He seemingly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pig's chariot.
He declared that there was a large boar in the chariot with the blood of the kitten.
The forensic test confirmed that the boar weighing 550 pounds broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, named "Vu", according to a quote in Guayang's evening news.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
Market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs who attacked people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to her husband.
Ten years earlier a pig of 650 pounds caught a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activater".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of hurricane Rosa will bring flood rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods of rain to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a hurricane from category 1 of 5.00 on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to emerge over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward to the western coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to bring large tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the coming depression will create heavy rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, a flow of ruins and possible landslides in the desert.
The large tropical moisture will cause rainfall that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The sudden floods are possible due to rapidly exacerbating conditions that are due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to go into the desert on foot in the possibility of tropical rain.
Porn rain can cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and storms with thunderstorms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The coming depression will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
A total of more than half an inch of rain is possible, which can cause rivers from ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
The occasional tropical rains will start coming closer to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain expands more late Monday and Tuesday.
Porn rain will expand into "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected throughout the United States due to Arctic cooling, but tropical areas remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be found in the United States' central parts on Sunday.
There's almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rebuild and expand.
Most of the United States' central and eastern regions are expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures to 80 degrees from southern plains to the Sveroist.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast points to the possibility of sub-average temperatures for eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony Thursday by the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of having a sexual assault reportedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the unexplained political situation continued, with speakers who interrupted regular turnover programmes at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, put together an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that he was 100 percent certain that Cavanaugh was a drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, saw him on Friday.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that they displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To be shown better, it is an audience of the size of a playoff competition in football or awards of the film academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Cavanaugh's appointment, led to all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters calling him Friday morning while he was trying to enter the elevator for the hearing of the trial committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as they reprimanded him, and it was all transmitted live to CNN.
"They are standing right here in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, he would have more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was due to vote to advance Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate for voting.
But Flake said he would only do that if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the accusations against the nominated next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and with a few senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was of great importance, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "playing politics" over coastal
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermine national interests in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "checkers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect loan expenses is "fully absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: police arrest suspect Dieton Simpson for the death of an athlete at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Simms' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Dieton Simpson has been arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge's police department said.
Authorities released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB's partner told CBS.
After they questioned Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the parish of East Baton Rouge released the preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanks the Luiziana state police refugee unit, the criminal laboratory of the state police, South University police and citizens of the area for the assistance they have made in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked police for her "activities in search of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6,6-footback grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 caught balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destructive" and "in shock" from Simms' death.
"This is what you care about forever," the coach said.
Vulcans threw ashes at Mexico City
Throwing ash from the volcano, Popocatetpel reached the southern settlements of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans Sunday not to go to the volcano after taking action in the crater and were registered to 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The centre followed a number of tattoos and earthquakes.
The images of social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in the settlements of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicians observed an increased activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72km) southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Gojo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence clashed with police for public order and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and colors at dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and police used their thumbs to suppress the fights.
More than a few hours of independence groups called out, "No forgetting, no forgiveness," and on the other hand, union protesters shouted "For a long time to live in Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in the protests, local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterised the October 1st referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalanists.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was small because of the boycott by people who are against secession.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups campaigned overnight Friday to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcisse Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has a chance of winning independence.
"Last year we had one of our best times.
I watched my parents cry out of joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they won a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the dynamics of the year with many of their most famous leaders or in self-elected persecution or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and a consistent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, filming the protest for police support, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before trial last year, said he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonders: Men Arrested After Cars In Home
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a repeat vehicle in a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred in Balinagard Kresent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said that damage to the gate and to the building itself was caused.
At one point, it could have been shot with an arrow from a crossbow to a car.
Menga's victory brought Livingston 1 - 0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The advanced Livingston sealed the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to be significant while Gary Hold's side rose one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's party lost its victory in the season's championship and will face the leaders of Harts next week, behind which eight points are lagging behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe the League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the six-game division, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed a chance against cruel guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they gave the goal, and their directness caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was dragging the attack around the goal, and then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after skating the blow with Craig Halquet's head over his goal.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing they could create problems with their actions.
And that's exactly how the crucial goal came.
Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set Menga together, who only by touch gave the goal from the center of the sixteen.
By that time the Rangers dominated the ball, but they couldn't break the defense of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly played us for the most part.
That scheme continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of the skill of Ranger goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set up action on Livingston.
Livingston's sixteen were constantly passing it and was repeatedly defended, while two penalty requests - after Halquet's disputed exchange of Glenn Middleton and one hand - were rejected.
"Fenomenally" by Livingston - analysis
Alasder Lamont on BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to overcome the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga was still holding Connor Goldson and Joe Waral on alert.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard's leadership, they now lag behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once were able to open the hosts – and it was a little awareness of the Rangers, who were found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Kolonja
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (September 29th) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
They deteriorated due to problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Kolonja to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons as saying to prevent a crowd from collecting 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds have also pleaded, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposed protesters depict the division of a visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as a highway by others.
Traffic accident on the way to Deptford: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A Velosipedist died after a car collision in London.
The collision took place near the intersection on the streets of Bestoud and Evelyn, a high - traffic accident in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city in about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and came in an ambulance, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist's death in a car accident on Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the Saturday clash.
Metro police said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been placed and buses have been rerouted and it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Sufficient in Restlessness · Global Voices
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a male prison with a high level of security, the prison's office said.
The riots broke out in HMP Long Martin in Worchestshire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and still last.
The Tornado unit's experts were brought to resolve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited in one wing.
The cops were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
The prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff has been instructed to handle the ongoing incident in HMP Long Latin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious riots where personnel were attacked with pool balls.
hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (can be useful for the dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining force of hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, leading to a risk of sudden floods.
The State Meteorological Station has already issued warnings of possible sudden floods Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, all the way to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that only “ten tropical cycles kept the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border."
The latest models of the State Center for hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches on the edge of Mongolian Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rockets Mountains and the Great Basen will likely have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas for sudden floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to benefit because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the US Sushi Monitoring Body, nearly 40 percent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," the weather said.
First, the route of hurricane Rosa has led to ground dives all over the lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punat Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold waters in the Pacific, and it's shrinking.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of floods.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," the weather said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah until late evening Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is many abundant rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States," the State Center for hurricanes said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and ruins streams, as well as landslides in the mountainous regions.
Midsamer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for attempted murder · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Excelsior Terrace area at Midsamer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He's been taken to a hospital and is in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Radstock district, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone footage from the incident, to step forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the democratic party's most cruel and scandalous tactics," Trump said at a gathering in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasi Ford's accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and on her accusations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republicans' exit in early elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I am not running, but I am really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and fighting for great candidates."
Trump said Democrats have a mission to "resist and interfere".
The first key vote on Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the senior head of the GOP told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, and the total number of victims increases
At least 384 people were killed, many were taken from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in town of Palu on Friday when waves of 6m (18 feet) hit the coast of the sunset, referring many to a certain death and destroying everything on their path.
After the 7.5-strength earthquake, a tsunami struck.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for BNPB mediating in Indonesia's briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragging cars, wood, houses, hit everything on the mainland," Nugrojo said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea with speeds of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed wood to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
The air photos published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and destroyed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The following tremors continued to rock the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPT) said that energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the energy released from the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "much," and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels collapsed.
Some victims' bodies were found stuck under the ass of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast of 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in a post, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing us that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said waves came about the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting crazy, warning people on the street down there about a tsunami approaching.
In a few minutes, a wall of water is stuck on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't confirm the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a power cut off by communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other essential needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo had planned to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia rose above 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision personnel from Dongala safely arrived in town of Palu, where employees are more sheltered in shelters from tarpaulins in the courtyard of their office, they went through scenes of wasteland, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as the relief groups began their dark efforts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign experts were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," said Ulija Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can receive international assistance, but there is still no status."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the wonders that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was stuck under the ass for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandon, the coach of Indonesian State Paraglidership Team, trained two of the missing paragliderists for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others stuck at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paraglidership, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, when she began to circulate the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliderist community, he was desperate to send messages to whatsApp to competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended with only a gray sign of cycling, instead of a son.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26.750 when filling ATMs at Newport's Kaye.
Thieves stole $26.750 from an employee at Brink's who complemented a ATM at Newport's Kaye, according to a press release from Newport Police Station.
The car driver emptyed the ATM at the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While busy, another man ran from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
The Witnesses noted several suspects fleeing the scene, according to a statement, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to J.
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ay.
The change published on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The system previously known as Kanje West."
Forty-one-year-old West wore the nickname Yej for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was issued in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where his new album "Yandhi" is expected to be published.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to cancel "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Although using it as a shortcut to his current professional name, the West said earlier that the word had religious meaning to him.
"I think that 'ej' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'you'," the news said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with the broadcaster Big Boy.
"What does it mean? I'm you, it's us, it's us.
He left Kanje, which means the only one, up to Ye alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a show of who we are."
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names of Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, Jay Zee, also uses his name with or without cartoons and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the military on civilians
Mexico's VD President Andres Manuel Lopez Oberdor has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches to the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolko Plaza that "he will never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military fired at peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly assistance to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
United States needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the U.S. should double research funds in the field, the investor and practitioner for AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple said.
Comments arrived after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
Double funds can double the chances that the next big achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Supersili in artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was issued this month by Houdon Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invest in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranking American suit player, and later was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Li thanked for previous US government technology competitions as a challenge to the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics and asked when the next match will be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grenades, Li said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should automatically be offered to doctors of science after artificial intelligence," he said.
China's state council issued its Development Plan for the future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation is funding people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organisations are handing out money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should cover partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of an authorised Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they currently invest more than $100m a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that demanded the creation of a National Commission for the Security of Artificial Intelligence had no effect for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign raised doubts about whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The vote on the referendum paper said: "Are you ready for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Djoorgievska, 79, in Skopje, said.
Although not legally binding, enough parliament members said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13.00.
However, the turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, the capitalist, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small scene and chairs outside tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get our heads up high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
The poll, released last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required exit.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
To be successful, the referendum should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would have been the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since they came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero on Manchester City spent all of Brighton's defense goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's 2 - 0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Atihhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
It quickly passed between the three Brighton defense players before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four greens.
He circled one defense player before running a few others on the edge of Brighton's sixteenth.
He then handed it to the left of it, to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to return Aguero's ball, which with his right foot beat Brighton's goalie, Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 - 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave it naked at that moment."
But the original advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister of the League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before he led Sterling to the far stasis.
The attack of “the blues of heaven ” brought the ball into the net before it came out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a match at the League of Champions' League on 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rain-Necar arena, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play a spoiler against Rockys.
Since Nationals were eliminated from the struggle for the playoff, there was no reason to push another start.
But always the competitive Schercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still implications for a playoff for the Rockis team, who are leading with one match before Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockis' team had at least a Joker in place with a 5-2 victory over Nashnels Friday night, but they still struggle to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we play for nothing, at least we will be able to throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still need to announce a starter for the week, but they are reportedly inclined to allow Schercer to throw himself into such a situation.
Sherzer, who's going to start on 34th, was training to throw on Thursday and throw the usual vacation on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike points in 220 2/3 of the season.
Mythins to Trump in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation about his choice of Brett Cavanaugh for the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of the republican exit in the early elections.
"All we have done so far will be put at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, terrible groups of Democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means at their disposal, seeing wickedness, insolence.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them it."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and interfere".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "egg, wicked, rude and untrue".
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein of the ranks of the Democrats, appointed by the Senate's Judicial Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted with cries of discomfort.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, and no, I wait a little -- that was a very bad body speech -- the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Labists no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When Takum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last in line of members of parliament from the laborist party to whom we are told that we are not welcome – just because it expresses its opinion.
My fellow partner, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censoring movement has criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the East Labour Party of Nottingham stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party's parliament, the council meetings were exactly the same on Friday night.
Unfortunately, today, it is not the tone of most meetings, but the promise of a "mild, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is being judged whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take views that I would never otherwise have taken, whether it was national security or the EU's internal guard.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical abuse of social media that calls for convictions, disowning the policies of the center, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great fear of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every demand for a "do not trust" or a change of selection rules, the party becomes more concerned.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not the reason I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the laborist party as a student, provoked by the concerns of Thatcher’s government that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed it most, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could have been confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with ongoing leadership.
To those who supported Friday's request, all I want to say is that when the country is going to go coerce towards Bregzit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the labor party.
But I have a message that's not about Nottingham Moment, but about my voters, whether they're members of the labor party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how much judgmental threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from sharing in a way that I think is in the best interest for all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ear Goes to Top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear has earned the triumph in this wonderful entertainment match on the day of the World Cup of Scotland in football.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
Finally, everything is due to their superior defenses, as well as their improved chances, carried by the home team, and Coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Glory to Ear, they have better taken advantage of their chances than we have. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Frasier Klemo, gave Air priority, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the Voriors game, allowed Melrose to improve numbers, and Jason Bagot grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo extended Ear’s leadership with a penal, earlier, at exactly halftime, he scored a point, so he converted solo points to reach 17 - 5 for the Ear on Rescue.
But Melrose well started the second half, and Patrick Andresson's point, converted by the Bag, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarde Nott, which was taken out on the stretcher, and from the re-start, Air continued to struggle with Stafford McDowell's point, converted by Klimo.
Air Captain Blair McPherson then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for an additional man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team regained even when Struan Hachinson got a yellow ticket to knock down Klimo without the ball, McPherson took a touchduan from the foam line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
The climate converted, as it did almost again since the re-start, after Kyle Roe took David Armstrong's blow and sent the wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The Star of Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Star of Still Game, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move to the catering industry after it was found to be named director of licensed restaurant companies.
Fifty-six-year-olds play Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series, where he's a screenwriter and plays together with his long-standing comedian partner, Greg Hemfield.
Duot announced that the next ninth season will be the last and it seems that Kiernan plans to live after Craigling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's source indicated that Kirnan was trying to join Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a covered-in Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued to the motto: “The sea is rightly ours.
It's our duty to return."
Through land Bolivia, the memory of the shore lost in favor of Chile in a bloody 19th century conflict of resources is still fresh, as is longing to sail again after the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the largest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the international court on October 1st after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Kalsadi, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision taken by the international court of large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to Bolivia's sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of native origin, who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year, also depends a lot on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he said in a solemn statement at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to judge in behalf of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favour.
The UN-based body in the Netherlands has no power to allocate territory to Chile and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The verdict of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments suggest that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And the last four years may have restored Bolivia’s cause rather than improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Kalsadia also rejected that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the problem of the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should overcome the past."
North Korea says no nuclear disarmament will come unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep their promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it is "fiction" to be considered as continuing sanctions and US objections to the declared completion of the Korean war will bring North Korea to their knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first to take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion audits reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on its way to the largest shops in your vicinity.
If you want to improve the size of your hat collection or completely block the sun, then don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy big hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that blinded the style set on Fashion Week in Paris.
Most impractical hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their designs that fall into their eyes after the runway.
The piece that Valentino pointed out was a huge beige hat decorated with wide trigger in the form of feathers that flooded the model's head.
Other large additions included zirconium watermelons, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation looked like diving equipment completely with glasses and a diving pipe, and the other looked like a melted corny ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style trackers predict that huge hats can come to shops near you.
The large hats came very quickly after "La Bomb", the straw hat with a large two feet wide that brings everyone from Rijana to Emily Rataykovsky.
The cool fashion house behind the overly impractical hat spread through social media sent another big creation after the runway, a straw bag for the beach with a size almost equal to the height of the model you dragged.
The dark orange refinery bag, with a refinery board and a white leather handle, was the piece that was highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques on Fashion Week in Paris.
The stylewriter, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags at the shops next summer, because the designer caused such a great influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many accessories. ”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are maintaining academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which only boosts individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement custom school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as an election item in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, he will make it polite.
If you talk to him in his tongue, it'll hit him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build ties and trust with people from other countries.
As of this year's recent test results, we can note that languages exceed all other items with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved higher rating "5+".
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of the students achieved a higher score of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an election subject, are seen at the same level as STEM's (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programmes in independent schools as well as elsewhere.
The OECD Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 noted that the reasons for employers’ failure to fill jobs were 17 percent due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
No matter what career a person will choose, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically favour the polyglot before competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults from the O.K. in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to be able to talk, and French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
To invest in language teaching is now important for children today.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the language it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important in the O.K. when they look forward to 2020 as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter who your child's interests are, there will always be numerous languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future will bring.
Currently, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as "International Communications Skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"Il faut bin le faire" (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron would have led Lakers into San Diego on Sunday.
The wait almost ended for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first match in the week's run against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's gonna play, it hasn't been decided yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play limited time.
After training at the beginning of Sunday, James was asked about his six-game schedule for the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the pre-season of this phase of my career to prepare," he said.
U-Tub channel to rally to Trump in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of mythins as part of the campaign tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five scheduled mines of Trump in the next week, including places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote for confirmation of his election to fill the gap in the Supreme Court is at rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because Republicans can lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you view it online?
Trump's rally in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7pm. Time zone on the East Coast tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia via live streaming on YouTube.
This week, it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of a man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who has become tense because of charges of misbehave from a sexual nature with an expected delay in the Senate vote until a week, pending an FBI investigation.
The primary goal of a series of mythins is to help Republicans get a swing for the November elections.
Hence, President Trump's campaign said that these five mythins next week are aimed at "a boost to volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The congressional control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible as the start of the difficult campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be named.
In the Wesbanko arena in Wiling, tonight's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, according to the Metro news from West Virginia.
On Saturday, a second visit to Trump to West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not good for Morrisei that the president must come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team shows courage in fighting to keep hope alive at the beginning of individual games on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the fours on Saturday afternoon may have been just what the Coop Ryder needed.
Turning to happiness is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all, in such competitions.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky I guess," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, of four points and twelve more games.
The Americans according to Spit, feel they have a weak wind in their sails even though they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points of four.
Spitt was excellent and water with an example.
Those strong cheers of celebration grew stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the alignment of four or four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His coup with which he won the 15th was welcomed by a similar cry, telling you that he believes that the American team is not out of play.
"You just have to take care of the deep and take care of your competition," Spit said.
That's all any player has left now.
18 holes to score points.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Cup Ryder.
The strange, but beautiful duo of Europe is four out of four and can't be wrong.
Molywood was the only couple without bad hits Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way it seems to be running their energy to and from this noisy group ensure that they are players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nasional, except Fleetwood or Molinari.
He prefers both at the same time to different holes.
However, talks on European fame remain unwarranted.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he merged with Alex Noren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole that they never got out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to see closely because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they don't follow, and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved considerable leadership on the last day, but the four season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, had doubts.
Europeans led by 10-6 on the last day of Cup Ryder
Europe will come in with a solid advantage on the last day of Cup Ryder after Saturday's leadership in double pairs and fours of 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far on Le Golf Nasional on four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who fought to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had many failures in the morning double couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans gave more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but they couldn't reach the lead.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points of 12 individual games a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair in general that won four points in the first four matches in Cup Ryder's history.
After they "snapped" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat the worn-out Woods and US beginner Bryson Deshambu with an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods, who made it through two swords on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 out of 29 double couples and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning double couples, returned as Henry Stanson's partner to the four with a defeat of 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coupka -- ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all about that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for Americans on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2+1 victory over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Puller in double pairs and returned later to defeat Puller and Rory McLroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost to the original, two holes.
Only two times in the history of Cup Ryder a certain team has recovered from four points in an individual game, although as holder of the title, Furik's team has had enough equal results to keep the trophy.
Since it was the second two days, however, Sunday's anti-attack seems to remain above them.
North Korea Says "There is no way" to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extended sanctions deepen the mistrust in the United States and that there is no way that the country will give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear rocket tests, disabling nuclear testing facilities and making a commitment against proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to accessing nuclear disarmament "in phase", under which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not refuse unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ree alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit at all at the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed to working towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump gave guarantees of the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to give in to strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "nuclear disarmament above all" and raises the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is the insidious dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ree did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "Until the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end up in such a stalemate".
However, Ri's speech tone was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the American mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "cancer" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year with a "full destruction" of North Korea, much more commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying "Do it take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking steps.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The Security Council's sanctions must continue fully and without exceptions until full, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pjongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but last time it didn't go well.
He left Pjongyang in July with a statement that progress was made, but was denied by North Korea only after hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea commits to a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "adequate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "adequate measures" he seeks are the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves to normalise relations with Washington
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing macho culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing about basic care.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of medical medicine at Harvard Medical College and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of under-resistance on learning.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said no one, never told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to the students how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic results, and improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during Sunday.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student home where students press on coffee glasses, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how inadequate sleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn about how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about the effects on health when you choose to smoke a cigarette," Professor Chaisler added.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and besides modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the student in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even in order to avoid thickening, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into a hunger regime, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old student from California in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student town.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the “son light” broadcast from the electronic screens and the LED light, which moves the circus rhythm, resulting in problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga’s goal brought down Gerard’s men
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's blow sent Steven Gerard's team to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to register its first victory after the February 4-1 triumph at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team suffered the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as the manager who left his team with eight points behind the fugitive leading team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' setup lost its inspiration and chance of evening out.
Now the Rangers have fallen to the sixth place, and Livingston has boarded the third and are only behind the Hibernant according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for the Rangers after Line Judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for head trauma after he was clearly hit with an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the crew that passed Air at Cup Betfred's semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingston who won points with Harts last week and would be pleased with the way his well-trained setup choked opponents on every chance.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
It was supposed to score, two minutes after the start when Menga's first show of play passed Scott Pittman down to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-row player missed his chance.
Then a blow from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Litgou could only play openly in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed there was more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penal in the fifteenth minute he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thompson did not give a sign of the Colombian complaint.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals to the goal in the first half, but the former goalkeeper of Aybrox Liam Kelly did not suffer from the blow to the head of Lasanna Culibali and the weak blow to these Edaria.
Although the beginning of Livingston's 34th minute may have been the opposite of the game, no one can deny that they deserve to play their game.
The Rangers have failed to deal with Jacobs' blow again.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which with a cold head chose Menga as a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the halftime when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from his block line.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play the kind of game they enjoy, with Litgou and Hackett caught a lot of long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set himself up well and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head on a turtle.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton has had another penalty request since he crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson did not approve again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday of the morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on today's day, and WE ARE ABLE ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, it has become the main stronghold of science, the Geiger counter has become the main stronghold and the popular culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bell of Colorado", in which those seemingly unconvinced, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform:
Man: “What else is that? ”
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms that release the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now! ”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that carries his name is still there.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the stray cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the stray cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the removed cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their changes in the laboratory
You can “see ” protein honor in many cancer species, and then be returned to the organism
The test vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the affected cells, Ovarium cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can “see” protein honor in many types of cancer called HER2 and then return to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the US National Institute of Cancer, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and their “teaching” how to target cancer cells works when treating a certain type of leukemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp out, wearing a drop with his motto, after performing on Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was spotted in the studio during a live show Saturday night after a useless performance that praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called The City of Spirits, with a drop of inscription to make America Slavna again, he began to criticise the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"At times when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday's, evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Cavanaugh before the Senate's legal question committee, associated with allegations of sexual assault against Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's fallout was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
Also, the West complained to the audience that he had a difficult time behind the stage because of his drop.
"Beyond the stage, I was ridiculed.
They said, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in the latter place, he said, according to the Washington Exeminer.
The news continued: "You want to see the sinking place?" he said he would "put his supermen hat on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments attracted discomforts from the audience at least twice, and the team of the evening show seemed embarrassed, Warajetti reported, a man told the publisher: “The whole studio is taking away. ”
News was brought in as a last-minute replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
News was supported by the leader of the conservative group TSPAD, Candace Turner, who wrote to Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: I thank you for putting together the crowd. ”
But show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was its own and it's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for which I believe he accepts and expands the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and he is now "formally known as the Caine West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lyon and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, has changed his name to a symbol, and then in the artist of formerly known as the Prince.
Prosecution for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast

The charges will be examined by the D.A.
The Star of the Trons Game, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series of Troons.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho hero stereotype when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be strong to be respected.
In a statement about Sunday Times culture, Keith said he believes that "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the era of #Now I am saying.
Kit, who recently married the Game of the Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "powerful feelings" on that issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment -- where were we wrong with manhood?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Kitt believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic manhood, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is being taught?
What is taught on TV, and what on the street, which makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because there's obviously something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a continuation of the Troons' Game when the show ends next summer, saying it "ending with battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will be performing in the reconstruction of the Real West of Sam Shepherd, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Troons' game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life," he said.
Rose played Igrit, a guy who had a loving attraction to Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic show that won Amy's awards.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/SID: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sida.
More than 800,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HlV has spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Junan.
Year after year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV through sex is an acute question to the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination of people from the LGBT community is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data released by a member of staff related to the Republican Party's senator as "dangerous lies" and "conception theories"
US Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her staff published personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The Democratic from Los Angeles assured that claims are on "ultra-right" sympathies and websites.
"Laws, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home address and phone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hec of Utah.
Information appeared on the Internet Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill as the Senate panel lasted to be heard about charges of misbehaviors against Brett Cavanaugh, nominated judge of the Supreme Court.
Reported information appeared shortly after Cavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Preservative locations such as Gates Pandite and Redstite have announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the post is connected to Waters' office and information has been published on a member of Waters personnel, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those unreal and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information presented.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleisher.
"These denials are nervous," Flasher wrote.
"This shows that she has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he didn't do, he mustn't be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats associated with Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of critics because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office notified "the competent institutions and police of false claims.
"We will allow offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all of their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all of my staff."
The thought of Johnny English attacking again -- undermining the spy scams of Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for elements of Bregzit in every new film with a British connection, and that seems to be true for this renewal of the franchise of the fraud, action comedy Johnny English -- which started in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: born again.
Is careful self-involvement on the subject of how clearly we are for nothing will be the new possibility of exporting the nation?
Despite all this, the person with big eyes and many faces of the incompetent Johnny English has got a license to "frozen" things the second time -- his name above all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for viewers in movies in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour, resembles Clouseau, has drawings of Mr. Bin and part of a boy who plays a note of the Kochii song on fire since the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
His foundation is the traveller and the mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed at Barklis' now forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor’s feathers hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and impossible mission and themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor looks like it's meant for children, instead of adults, and Johnny English's crazy accidents aren't as innovative and focused as the silent writings of Bin's character on Atkinson.
The theme that goes through all the time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated a super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British field agents, to disappointment the agent on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combat figure and is already suffering from the full melting of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best in this character of quasi-Teresa-Mei, but there is nothing special in the script that would work with it.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling himself Johnny English, who now works as a private school teacher, but "black" gives secret agents classes: there are a couple of good boys here when English offers a spy school that resembles a rock academy.
English was quickly called to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in connection with a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all the things in the Royal Secret Service go back into action and meet the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buleta, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: wicked Jason Walt, acting out of Jake Lacey.
Ingles and Bow begin their odysssey of absurd actions: transformed like waiters they burn French restaurant; they make a waste after they smuggle themselves into the luxury yacht of Walt; and English begins real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the inside of the House of Walt.
All brakes are removed for the final sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there are a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderate stuff.
And like with other Johnny English movies, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to use his talent?
Labists deny that they're building a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week -- but will be paid by five.
The party reportedly wants companies' bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend -- but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "replys" with the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more prone to workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A highly-ranked party member told Sunday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but working week for four days is an effort that is in line with the party's accession to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary elections campaign.
However, aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party does not consider such an idea".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "the directors faceless" and "professors" in the utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour Government could make "deductions" because of unethical behaviour.
He also reiterated plans for workers to become part of the boards of companies and to create an inclusive property fund with 10 per cent of private companies' capital to belong to employees who can take annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lyndsey Graham, John Kennedy, declares "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh can reconsider
The FBI's investigation into the accusations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination at the Supreme Court for at least a week and has discussed the issue of whether the Bureau's findings could be considered by some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, the correspondent for the 60 Minute Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think he understands," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be carved into stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Cavanaugh and a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blacey Ford.
"Everyone she named couldn't confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and did you do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizens festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held seven times, and the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012 is a continuation of the global poverty project, an international activists group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they do not want to pay for VIP ticket), participants must meet several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email message to a world leader, a phone call or some other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Golbal citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of "click-activeism" - people who feel like they're making a real difference by signing petitions on the Internet or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have argued that they have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and references as a result of their activities, of which $10 billion have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the raised funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, the partnership of investors and contractors, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children exploit their potential", which promised to provide $35m to Rwanda for help with insufficient food in the country after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens the same as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Food, said in front of the crowds at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities are related to calls for improving the diet of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Food Power, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the often asked questions on their website, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens responded: “It will be a long and difficult road - once we fail.
But like the great civil and anti- apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janelle Mona, are some of the artists who will be performing this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Li Fournes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy to "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Ministry
Washington can "as long as it takes" to use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinki has discovered, as said by Washington Exeminer.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria -- namely, where it acts after an invitation to a legitimate government -- is a front for researching new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government's envoy, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways remain open and if necessary by block to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinky addressed the presence of an event organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group representing itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he was effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing the fuel," he said, while talking to Russia as "one awkward pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed the Trump administration's launch of a mission to boost the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made from Berlin a "prisoner" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth $11 billion, should double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stand came across resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said
Masacuse Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after the mid-term election.
During a meeting in the town hall in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our non-functional government, which means a woman on her forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the town hall and said he "led the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren opened up in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as judge at the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Twitter message Friday, Warren said "it is clear that we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released Thursday showed that many voters in its electoral unit think it should not be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Saffolk/Bosnian Globus.
Thirty-two percent support such a bid.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting potential nominations and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names from the democratic party discussed with the nomination in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin is talking about Trek Paylin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally.
Trek Pailin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and indicted in a domestic violence incident Monday night
"What my son is going through, which he has been going through since he returned, I know how other families who are feeling torn apart because of the more traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are returning to," she told the audience at a rally on Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pailin called the arrest "a elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "are returning a little different, they return fixed, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their air force buddies have given for the country," and any other military member gave it to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by an assault on a female, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of alcohol weapons, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Vasila.
18 federal states and Washington City backs challenge new asylum policy
The 18 federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents asylum from giving victims who flee from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington petitioned the court (amicus uriae) on Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers who challenge politics, En-Bi-Si News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's case against Parliament, which the American Union of Civil Liberties submitted in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
A state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many asylum demands in the United States came from, as nations with constant gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annuls the 2014 IMI Board's decision that allowed undocumented immigrants who flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
City of D.C. Attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of law-making at the level of federal states, federal and international".
"Federal law requires all asylum requests to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such provision violates that principle," according to a petition to the court (amicus chubiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter claim that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary workforce".
Public defender Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims who flee from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is an asylum for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Seshns said when representing politics on June 11th.
The asylum has never been designed as a solution to all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby at an evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes and choose from their listed items to save something that they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 - magnetod earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tearsy reached into his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the fifth - floor hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, so I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador blames China for "maltressing" with "propaganda commercials"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China's paid addition to China's Tea Daily in De Moin Register -- the most sold newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of being involved in US elections for the November 6th congress, China rejected the indictment.
Trump's indictment that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked a joint US service for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial promotions, Beijing and Washington, they are currently at a trade war in which they balance import tariffs with each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from federal states such as Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former, longtime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of De Moin Register, "now doubles the abuse of propaganda advertising in our free press".
"In the demining of propaganda, China's government abuses the unsettled American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertising in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a close press stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most read newspapers refused his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans move away from women's votes ahead of mid-term elections, due to the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
With many Republicans watching or defending Brett Cavanaugh's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no turning back," wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political sciences at Maxwell College at the University of Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Riher said he suspected that the pressure on the FBI's investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, in front of the Washington D.C. newspaper Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "Noumvri is coming!" at a protest in the Senate hall, when Republicans, who have control over the board of legal questions, decided to continue the Kavanaugh nomination despite Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford's testimony, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they are tall; that's true.
But they may be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even in front of Ford's public testimony in which her accusations of sexual assault against a candidate for a Supreme Court judge have been detailed, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to the En-Bi-Si news.
"It's not just about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Cavanaugh will go to a hearing, it's about the way the Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps choose Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans are divided about who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, although the majority accept the first-name side.
A new poll by Ju-Gov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or likely trust Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied about the testimony, while only 30 percent feel the same way about Ford.
After Fleece's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought out of Ford, as well as at least one more, of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified in front of the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, under oath, last week that Cavanaugh was intoxicating her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court judge of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Network inventor plans to start a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Network, begins with a start-up business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inapt, is a company that was built on the open-air platform at Solid, Berners-Li.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Li joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own 'net data storage' or a shortened floor.
It may contain contacts, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluk, Slex and Spotifay are all available to one viewer at the same time.
What's unique about the personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a certain kind of information.
The company calls it "personal data strengthening".
Inrupt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce is the company to provide resources, process and adequate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with an agreement to work on the project and the community of coders volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inapt website.
Berners-Li said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a press release, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "the Inbat mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet by establishing a consortium of the world network of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Lately, Berners-Li has been an influential spokeswoman in the Internet's neutrality debate.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Network consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the Internet," Berners-Li added.
Bernard Van: Known carrier of Victorian Cross since World War I
The only English church priest to receive the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter is celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Reverend Bernard Van received his confession on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Belengliz and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military medal.
A commercial stone was discovered by his two grandkids at Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was a "amazing symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the medal.
According to London's Gazeta, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Channel de Saint-Kventin "under a very dense fog and under strong fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to places where he fired and with “the greatest courage ” led ahead, before himself attacking a cannon nest and disabling three of the repairers.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - nearly a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that doesn't make us modest".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Youth Imperial Band from Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor to him to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support given by many people".
The fans of combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead received Pepa Pig
Imagine, you've been up all night to watch Belator 206, without having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The list of San Jose contained 13 fights, including six of the main cards that were displayed live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the UK viewers remained appalled when the channel moved to Pepa Pigs.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours of the struggle.
One of the fans on Twitter described the transfer of child cartoon film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to transfer to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, vice president of Belator for marketing and communication, when asked for the transfer.
"Pepa Pig", yes"
The company's president, Belator Scott Kucker, said they would work on a schedule that would include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about being released again, I think we can probably find a solution," Cooker said.
"But there is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we transferred, we received a lot of messages and none of them were favorably.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We will limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of fans and we overstepped.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discuss on the desert island: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he went to high school that "they're all not like me"
Speaking on the first broadcast of Disks on the desert island on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-standing Kirsti Young show, took several months off because of the disease.
Showing up as a comparative figure in Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “By this day, those feelings of lower value and diversity were the things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so not to disappoint everyone when they finally learn about his sexuality.
The two bronze medal Olympic has become a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and has used its performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with a man -- the American film maker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 -- "me surprised".
Daley made a marriage to the Oscar, who is 20 years older last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Dayly, and Daley said that "all his views" had changed.
"As you asked me last year, everything was connected to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal in the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after his brain was diagnosed.
Daley said his father did not accept dying and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say "you won't be here to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about my whole life -- to jump in front of a domestic audience at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - The pride of Heather Small - which turned to his head in preparations for the Olympics and from which he was still difficult.
Discos on the desert island of Bi-Bi-Ci Radio 4 is Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, the horse is out of shape, was on the bench during Cup Ryder on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Cup Ryder game, but he will have to change his shape to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Mykelson, who plays the binary event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double couples and fours.
Instead of being in the centre of attention, as the United States often represents, the five - time winner, he shared the time to cheer up and exercise his game, in the range, with the hope that he would fix what he was holding back.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf Nasional playground, where far-off rough blows are a regular punishment when careless.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Michaelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who plays in pair with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who miss four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Mikelson's game can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
"He fully understands the role he played today, touches me on the back and puts his hand around me and says he will be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the celebrities and has been given a lot for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went that way, and we thought we had to do it.
He likes to play, like everybody else."
Mykelson will pass Nick Falldo's record for the most played matches at Cup Ryder on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in Cup Ryder where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halfs, although Furik said his presence carries something immaterial on the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's sensitive, he likes to joke with people, and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun playing with him, as was this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead in front of individual matches in the last day of Cup Ryder can easily turn into an indisputable position.
The Danish debuted in a competition in Walderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "they crossed the finish line with only noses", with the smallest lead of 14–13."
"I remind myself that we had great leadership in Walderama; we had great leadership in Brooklyn, when we lost both in Walderama, when we won for a while," said Bjorn, the painting, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead of 10-6 on Le Golf Nasional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play it right.
This is not over as long as the competition lasts.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and the focus stays on it.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players on our team, but we're fully aware of the opposite side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn added satisfied with the results of his players on a difficult golf course: “I don’t want to give premature grades on that issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow, we have individual games ahead of us, and that's a different job.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then you test all your abilities as a golfer.
It's a message to be sent to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they played in pairs, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furik himself was at both ends of the last day's changes, because he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser when Europe performed "The Wonder in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about it as Ben Cranshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set the line accordingly, and the order of the team is how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of resisting first and facing Rory McCllroy's most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform this way with the boys because I think that's how we'll cover everything," Bjorn said of the choice in individual games.
The new German warship has been postponed
The German Navy's latest frigate was scheduled to be delivered in 2014 to replace obsolete warships from the time of the cold war, but this will not happen until at least next year because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rainland-Faltz, the leading ship of the new class frigates Baden-Wetemberg, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the daily DiCate, calling for a spokesman for the military.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014 but the problem issues after the delivery hindered the fate of an ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wetemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be substituted for the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among other important characteristics is the rarest maintenance -- it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent up to two years from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern military ships -- which should allow Germany to have power through the oceans -- will be already obsolete until they enter the service, observes DiCate.
The frigate with an unfortunate fate F125 reached the front page last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Wass shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of key "s Software and hardware defects" that made the military ship useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important because ships from the class Baden-Wetemberg would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half the crew of the older frigates of Bremen class.
It also turns out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight which reduces its performance and restricts the capacity of the Navy to add upgrades to the future.
The Rainland-Falts weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the troubled hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including crew training -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- a rise in the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany's reduced maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem deteriorated over time because the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the class Baden-Wetemberg could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of the bats
A new property survey is being conducted in Scottish mountainous areas to discover how bats are using the area in search of food.
There is hope that discoveries will give answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help to conduct future protection activities.
A study of the national drone scientists for Scotland will follow ordinary and soprano bats, as well as brown bats with long ears and daubenton bats in the Inverow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameramen will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats during the season.
The staff of the En-Aych-Es and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of sounds of all images will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
A home map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, a nature protection adviser at En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of living are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
Such information will help to determine the benefits of living management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects beds and the loss of dwellings.
The winds and lights also pose a risk, as well as sticky strips for flies and some chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
Yet, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspection of beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only lilies reserve in Scotland on the property of Triv in Dumfris and Galovay, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The owner of David Thompson's estate says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to make progress."
He emphasizes that it is important to check that there are bats before real estate renovations are done because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, “We still have much to learn about bats and other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected the rape charges, and the lawyers will sue the German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called rape charges "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, which published the accusations.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker is accused of raping an American, named Katherine Majorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $35,000 not to talk about the incident, Der Spigel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video of Instagram's 142 million followers, hours after the accusations were made, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is false news," the five-time gold ball winner told his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything is good," added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for the accusations they called "inadmissible transfer of suspicions of private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damage due to "moral damage beyond the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the accusations took place in June 2009 in a suite at a hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting them at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anonymously, according to documents submitted to the court in the Clark district in Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after an alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good boy", but slipped below that "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex, but that there was an agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and made pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a no-trial agreement because she was afraid of revenge and was concerned "she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now demanding to modify the treaty because there are traumas to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and moved this summer to Italian giant Juventus with a 100m-euro deal.
Bregzit: Britain Will "Always Grief" Lost Car Manufacturers · Global Voices
Britain "will always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Bregzit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota-Britany told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at a plant in Bournaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the border congestion in the Bregzit case without an agreement would cost jobs.
The Bournaston factory -- produced by Toyota Arris and Avenis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"According to me, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a stop to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, Tito's managing director in Bournaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how EU leaving without an agreement would operate cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
B-Em-We, for example, says he'll close his own mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call risks to the logistics chain in the case of Bregzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the system "right on time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be an interruption at the border which, according to the industry, can cause delays and shortages in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily supply of inventory at the Derbishire factory, the company said, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly done to avoid such border checks".
"We should have an agreement. We should have the best agreement that will enable us not only to succeed in enjoying the present but to seize this opportunity," he told Radio 4's today's BBC programme.
"The evidence not only of Toyota, but also of other producers is that we must be able to continue what is very successful a set of logistics chains."
Toota could not say how long the production would have been stopped, but long-term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has worked in Bournaston for 24 years and is a representative of the factory union, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In accordance with my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House said
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the fight against Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for a Supreme Court judge continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential violations of the laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thus endanger Miller's independence, has been encouraging gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein was thinking of wearing a device to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with reports released last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was in the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "not want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid conflict with the Senate Justice Committee's hearing in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which will further delay the Senate vote.
The press secretary at Trump Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
She answered: “The date for the meeting has not yet been established, could be held this week, and could be delayed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see how things are going, and I always try to keep the press properly informed."
Some journalists argue that Sanders has not held a briefing for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings is not due to the lack of affection for the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organises several sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without stating the evidence: "We have considered those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it is far better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do this more often, and you are witnessing that we have been doing it over the last few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when exiting the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is the case with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance before the gathered journalists.
Health Secretary by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system regarding fears related to Bregzit
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and the desire to remain after Bregzit.
Gene Freeman, an MP in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering costs for the resolved status applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs Freeman wrote in his letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, in order to make the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of not reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of his citizenship.
Colleges from across the EU and widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are of useful importance to patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombi is subject to emergency surgery after he has suffered head trauma
Kristin Abercrombi, the defensive player (linebacker) of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury at the match Saturday when the team lost 31-27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He reached the side line of the playground and just scraped himself on the ground," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombi oxygen outside the playground, then put it in a stretcher and carried it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abekrombi is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red dress in Tennessee State after the Illinois transfer.
He totalled five crashes on Saturday before he left the game, resulting in a total of 18 crashes this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralise Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Ministry expects to raise up to 120 million pounds annually, funds to be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to secure access home and focus on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds increasing government efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that, besides the current administrative fee, includes higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property intended to rent it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects up to 120 million pounds a year with the move.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London have been purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which has led to price increases and has caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time involved in this process of buying property for housing.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "the cities of spirits" due to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in administrative fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of offering high-priced properties to keep the land, but did not use it and asked Mrs. May to change access home quotas in order to repair the "flight housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive household reforms, including rent control and the end of eviction for no justified reason.
He also wants the advice to give greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to the return of the British dream, or life to be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning your own home for many has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland said his "end ambition" was in the future to become the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scottish man, 42, enjoys the challenge of resuscitating the northeast club, which is currently third in the first league with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to the "St. Mirren Stadium" after returning "St. Mirren" back to the Scottish League premiere last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told Scotland's Sportsund on BBC.
"But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in "Hampden" with my father and always something dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity could only be obtained if I am successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as the manager of Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Mojos, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Pojet and Paulo Di Cannio.
Former head of Aloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club after he had turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "can I return this club to the Prime Minister's League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the prime minister of the league," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've achieved success here only if I put the club back there."
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, in which he went into his career after working as a assistant to the head of Dumberton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Aloa recover from the third league drop and returned St. Mirren from the edge of the loss of the title in the Championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real intersection for me," he recalls taking over "Alloa".
"I honestly believed that career as manager was the right choice for me, better choice than career as a player.
It sounds strange because it was going well, and I made enough money and enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you should go through on a Sunday basis.
I'm still going through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good about my role as manager.
I always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life."
You can hear the entire interview at Sports pound on Sunday, September 30th on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (British Summer Time)
According to one study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the company "CGA" for business consulting services in determining these figures said: "Suntime and longer than the expected participation of England at the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of pubs increased by 2.8 percent and the restaurants decreased significantly.
The decline in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June worsened even more during July.
The pubs and bars that mostly sell drinks have seen a much larger increase compared to the previous years than the restaurants where the decline was observed.
The pubs in which food is mostly sold were also badly affected by the sun’s periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, liquor sales increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales increased by only three per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for vacation and hospitality from "RSM", said, "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
There is no surprise that restaurants remain in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly devastating as an addition to the current pressures that cost.
The long hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for local owners who are mostly selling food and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the very needed rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in publishing new brands.
The "Coffer Peach Tracker" device for monitoring the sale in the pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of the same 47 operational groups with combined income of over 9 billion pounds and is a fixed rapper for the industry.
One of the five children has a secret social media profile that hides it from his parents
One study showed that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, has a secret social media profile that hides it from his parents and teachers
Research involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News increases fear that sexual content is published on such profiles
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile that they show their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, has created a profile of social media that hides it from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles, a shortcut to the Instagram website where photographs are shared.
News has increased the fear that sexual content is being published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clear "head" profile that they show to their parents, and they also have other private profiles.
One mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile at the same time came across a teenager asking others to rape her.
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headstress' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 years had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the vote of athletes" by the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle was elected executive director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and President Ian Beati described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the lead in this sport to take advantage of its widespread experience at international level over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has great respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I am ready to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really make my contribution and help with the proper direction of sports in Scotland."
The American who won the titles of 200m and 400m in the Atlanta Games in 1996, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, which now appeared regularly as a commentator of the BBC, could not go after having suffered a transitive ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show whether I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was hard work, but I was able to recover completely, so I can go back and do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
A breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows to cause division of Internet opinions
A company producing breast pumps caused a split of Internet opinion when it published an ad comparing mothers to milking cows.
To note the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's most popular breast pump", the user-oriented technology company Elvie published a funny ad inspired by music videos to show the freedom the new pump provides to the mothers who eat.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay in a song that sounds like this: "Yes, I'm begging milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't udders, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, push, milk my breasts."
However, the commercial that was published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it emphasized the milk industry's "dangerous" ones.
"A really bad decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, should become pregnant and be born so they can produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stealing from them after only a few days after they are born," one of the comments reads.
Elvie breast pump is discreetly incorporated into the breastplate ("Elvie"/ "Mother")
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is both traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "Really inappropriate advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she felt that the song was really “smiley. ”
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow because of the silliness.
The ad's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a brilliant product," one of the comments was.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial intended for mothers who milk (often in their jobs or in toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an ad that is missing or condemning the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing while discreet pumps were peed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, no wires, no tubes and discreetly fit into the breastplate, giving women freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out of home while milking.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR in "Mother" commented: "Elvie's Pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By setting up a parallel between women who milk milk and dairy cows we wanted to milk the pump and the challenges it brings to the centre of attention, showing the amazing sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump is present in all headlines.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubovski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children in custody has increased significantly although border crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to accommodate in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unidentified immigrants and feared endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to file fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official last week, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of minors without escorts.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons do not have prior criminal record.
"Said 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That is why we continue to pursue those individuals," said Mr. Albens.
In order to process the cases with children faster, authorities have introduced new rules according to which some of them will be required to appear in court within a month after being detained, not within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard stood.
Many will appear through a conference video call, not in person, to present their case of legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are considered ignorant to receive relief will immediately be deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, the workers in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where because of its size, there is a greater likelihood of neglecting the signs that the child faces difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city, without providing them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, may increase the trauma most of them are already facing.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also performs the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces had illegally resided in Syria's territory under the pretext that they were involved in the fight against terrorism and that "they would be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and do so without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" from the two terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accuse "some of Western countries" of "extreme irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise the issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided assistance for reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel resistance in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistur hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Mualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "sighting members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump to win second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win again in the 2020 elections unless his presidential mandate, which is likely to be a large part of the liberalists, is interrupted by impeachment and scandal.
In what will no doubt be "the most dramatic final in the presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the impact rate has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Nilsen says that "Fox News" averages 2.4 million viewers in impact time, which is about 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is announced.
"This is like a fire people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the drama "Designated Survival" by ABC for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skovl, a veteran in writing comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Skovl told me.
There's also some fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion from all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you are already looking at a panel of experts who debate the use of the "deep background" source by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", the bomb jacket from Paul Manafort's $15,000 note (the dress of fat arrogance), as he called "The Washington Post" and the implications of Mr. Trump's shocking descriptions of the anatomy by Storma Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"A part of what he does and what gives you the feeling of watching a reality show is that he brings you something new every night," says Brent Montgomery, head executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" for the rotating team of the Trump show and everyday twists (cars with NFL, praise for Kim Yong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because then you won't be able to make it up to you.
When I visited Mr. Fleece this week was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside of his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watched "MSNBC" while shooting on CNN.
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavanaugh was to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember we made all those crazy shows in the past and people said "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleece said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Inflow of external funds in the most difficult mid-term election in the run for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania congressional district receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of the congressional areas where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
A recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is being run by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another area in last spring's extraordinary elections.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Kit Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th congressional area, largely overlapping with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps were changed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas were manipulated in favour of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a difficult competition to fund campaigns among party chief sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congress Committee (DCC) and the National Committee for the Republican Party's Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the 18th Pennsylvania congressional district in an extraordinary election held in March, characterised by broad media coverage.
For over a decade this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the area as opposed to 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
US decides to punish El Salvador over support for China, and then quit
The diplomats stressed that Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing under a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump in June 2017 had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked off Tramp's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only in the case of El Salvador were fines taken into account, which received US aid of about $140m in 2017, including drugs control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have had a harmful impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment rates and killings in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar assembly last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any thinking about the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens is scheduled to address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of difficult messages or fines from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal reflections on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst close to the administration who also spoke of the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing it can happen is the release of Special Councilman Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which currently contains very solid evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is reportedly also directing his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign connects with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress composition changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again in front of voters, perhaps even before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many insecuritys here, and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable or his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to execute a coup on Hitler if the West resisted him and supported the Czechos in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and democracy's unscrupulous march has accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such points of change.
What would we do if Mr. Trump resigned to Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot chair after the newspaper announced that last year he proposed secretly to film the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for the function he was performing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How will we act if the new investigation of Brett Cavanaugh requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite the probable accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a congress to blame Mr. Trump?
If we fall for all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe it will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Jewish from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on a table with a swastika logo.
With this heritage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers with an optimistic attitude ahead of the "Rapid Vienna" clash
The Rangers are hosting a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after the undecided game against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, victory over Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-row player for knee injury, was prevented from showing up in the season until the unsolved 2-2 match with "Villerreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a bounceboard towards greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villerreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and came back with a winning point.
We may have been able to give a little more at the end, but the drawback was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and were better.
On Thursday, we have another big European night ahead of us.
I hope we win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of fans we'll fight back and get a positive score.
Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that happened, or my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a positive factor in the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope now we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear picture of the way they wanted to be cared, few talked to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Niationwide said they spoke to their spouses about long-term care expenses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss the same," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Company Nationwide.
Here's where you're supposed to start.
Talk to your mate and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care unless you give them your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how care can be obtained because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Also include your financial adviser: your adviser may also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your choices for financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or provide yourself with your own resources, if you have them.
Take care of your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the very beginning.
Take out full care of health care so that you can empower a trustee to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also think of your financial resources.
In this way they would choose a trust person to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medicines he is taking and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asks.

Who's gonna take care of the dog?

A man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he returned home from his exit.
The victim of about 40 years of age was in the Oxford Grove district in Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST (British Summer Time) as "a random act."
The victim didn't see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police appeal to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunamis that hit Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials said, with casualties expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, helpers cannot obtain information from the Dongala County, a district north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
In addition, several key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300km (180 miles) on the coast of the northwestern island of Sulavesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, was estimated in 2017 by the population of 299,200.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy of Central Sulavesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
The Indonesian disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, with nine people killed.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Acheh province in northern Sumatara on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were Acheh's inhabitants.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatara.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, and nearly 700 people were killed.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatara.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentavi, near Sumatara, causing a tsunami that reached up to 10m and destroyed dozens of villages, while killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake hit Paddy Jaya County in Acheh, causing desolation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, with more than 500 people killed, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the oldest son of Albania's former governor and vice-president Sarah Palin was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Matt-Su detention facility with the possibility of going out if he pays $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when he was asked how he pleaded before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A class violations, which means he can be fined in prison for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with B-class violations, I punished with one day in prison and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time you've filed criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, has called on the police to report an alleged attack.
The case before the Veteran Court of Alaska is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons of alcohol related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after saying that her son's violent behavior stems from PTSN, a consequence of his ministry in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulavesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for New York terrorist suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a death sentence for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck on Home Depot in October to launch a bicycle strike on the West Side highway in lower Manhattan and run over the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" committed serious bodily injuries, according to a report of the intent to seek a death sentence delivered in the South New York area.
According to the court papers, there is an opportunity to place a death penalty on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury filed charges against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The execution of the attack required "definite planning and thought," prosecutors said, with the way Saipov performed it describing it as "treasurable, cruel and perverse."
"Sifulo Habibulajevic Saipov caused, hurt, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lore Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlyj, Hernan Ferucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the country's intention was reported.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a death penalty case was prosecuted in South New York City.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal sentence was committed in New York City was in 1953 for Julia and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death in an electric capital on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court papers.
Police said he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS's videos on his phone.
Police also said he had requested to put the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 grounds of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence, rather than accepting a plea for guilt and giving life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence earlier asked prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
Tori party MP says NYJEL FARAZ should be in charge of the Bregzit negotiations
Nigel Faraz today during a protest at the Tori party's conference, pledged to "mobilize the People's Army".
Former party leader Ukip said politicians must "feel heat" by Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's MPs proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
conservative supporter Peter Bonn of the march in Birmingham said the United Kingdom would have "be out of the EU by now" if Mr. Faraz was Secretary for Bregzit.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May in terms of the merger of her deep-divided members was highlighted by counter-Bregzit members of the Tori party who joined a special protest against Bregzit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Checkers plan despite attacks by pro-Bregzit persons, counter-Bregzit's persons and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force the eurosceptics and members of the Labour Party to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bonn said at the pro-Bregzit convention "Leave Menans Leave" in Solihal that he wanted to "refuse the plan from the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would be out of the EU by now," he said.
An MP from Easter added, "I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the plan from the Checkers."
Voicing his stance against the EU, he said, "We did not fight in world wars to be subjected to now.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to remain in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and Pro-Bregzit party, was also present at the march and told reporters: "I am simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checkers plan is not well-accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists, which are actually those who go out into the streets and which are due to our victory in the elections.
Please cancel the checkers plan and start listening."
In a targeted message to Mrs May, she added, "Primeers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the assembly that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Bragzit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of handing over Bragzit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that allowed us to win in Bregzit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proudly united kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit faces marched across Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly downtown.
After the group's assembly, a small number of activists were present this weekend who carried banners with the inscription "Tarievci v Bregzit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at conservatives on security issues that faced the opening of a conference on the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for border-free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There is nothing called a good Bragzit," he added.
Warren plans to think well about running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says he "will think well about running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe announced that the Democratic Party of Massachusetts' representative spoke of his future during the town hall in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honor critic of President Donald Trump, will run in November for re-election against Republican Party State Representative Jeff Dil, who was the co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was in the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to the presidential post, whose maintenance uses city hall format.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time that "women go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes putting women at the top."
Suspect arrested for the shooting and death of basketball player Simms from the LSU team
Police at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms of the LSU team that took place on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dieton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock east.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help to identify the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
" Wade Simms had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result of it died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, "247sports".
Wade was involved in defending his friends and being shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, owned a weapon, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to custody in the police department of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
As a junior, 192 centimeters high, which grew up in Baton Rouge, Simms played 32 games with 10 events in the past season, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 caught balls after the match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team gave him victory over Sebastian Vetel
As of Saturday, Walter Botas qualified before Louis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the sex position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton hanging while defending his position in the first two circles and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel went first into boxing and left Hamilton to fight the blizzard at the end of the group, something that should have played a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing round later and came behind the Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one who forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly to leave the interior of his free risk to stay aside after a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstapen began at the back of the net and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimmy Raiconen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the box at the 44th round, but he couldn't increase the pace in the other eight circles, so Raiconen came to fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team has made a really exceptional decision to have its own two in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at Saturday's rally on her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blassie Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of a sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "insolent and rude and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and evil and reckless and dishonest," he said.
"When you watch the announcements and leaks of information and they say "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein with information about the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak of the information came from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not publish her story," Feinstein told the committee, declaring "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same rally on Saturday: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their malice, their insolence, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to step on to regain their power and control," the president said as Mediaite announced.
Elite League: “Dundee Stars” 5-3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for "Giants" in the match against "Dundee"
Dundee Stars has compensated for losing the Elite League contest Friday against Belfeast Giants by winning the 5-3 rematch at Dandi on Saturday.
Giants received the advantage of two goals reached by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took advantage of the host before Dwyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bushar equalized for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nillsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Kifi's boys to win over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., with the addition of Kendall McFol, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bowillier doubled the lead four minutes later.

Flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane to save themselves from the earthquake
The Indonesian flight controller has been famous as a hero since he died helping him on a plane with hundreds of people safely flying.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong consistent earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues' escape to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Juffrey Airport in Palu who was constantly targeting.
He remained in his position to ensure that the plane of Batik Air with flight number 6321, which was at the time on the runway would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was going down.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that he probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We've prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to be taken to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands of people, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many cannot even approach it," agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six metres devastation at Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “The rapid assistance carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Minimarkets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of Indonesia’s International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and ordered the national military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people killed.
Air Niugini now say a man disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated on the plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon now says that a man has disappeared, after saying earlier that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by a sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon they could not find the male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low.
"It is an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others were able to cross the water that reached half and headed for emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the stewardess were panicking and shouting, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors operating near the port's reconstruction also helped rescue, with the help of an inflatable ship, bringing people to shore before the plane sinks in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people were killed in accidents by PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but none of them were involved in Air Niugini.
Analyst established a time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended up presenting Saturday's case for the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He stressed about the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlet said he received data on the location of several mobile phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "laser because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only knew one week.
Rowlet said that for a while after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative attitude of this genre by including positive messages in its music.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip-hop has strayed from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists like "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their resuscitation through artists such as "Akali" and "Lowkey".
Another black woman?!
A New York nanny sues a married couple because she was fired after sending a "rasistic" message
A New York nanny sued a married couple for being fired based on discrimination after accidentally receiving a message from the mother who complained about the fact that she was "another black woman".
The married couple deny being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when she found out that she was black in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse Giselle Morris.
"Noteeeeeeeeeeeee another nigger," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman actually did, feeling "uneasy" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American woman, had done her job badly and that she rather expected the nanny to be from the Philippines, declares "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and was then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sues the married couple and asks for compensation for the $350 a day's layoff for six months, an engagement that will include her living with the family, what she was originally hired for, but without making a deal.
"I want to show them that these things should not be done," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know that this is discrimination."
The married couple responded to complaints that they were racist, saying Ms. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told "Post".
"But would you trust your children to the face you have been rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying that the lawsuit was "extortion", Plasco said his wife had only given birth two months ago and had been in a "very difficult situation".
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the social media married couple, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
Padington's publishers fear readers will not be able to connect with a talking bear, the new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, stated regarding the letter: “It is really hard to place yourself at the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about Padington's enormous success.
After saying that her father who worked as a cameraman for "BBC" before getting the inspiration to write the book out of a little bear-shaped toy, it would still be optimistic if his work hadn't been well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt lowly pride over his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But because you felt "Padington" so real, it was almost like having a child who reached something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you yourself.
I think Paddington's success took him that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited the credit to Padington himself.
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital "Louis Pasteur 2" in Nice, where doctors tried for nothing to save her life.
"My hope was regularly called to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive," said Mrs. En-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon enough.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that the doctors gave her to keep pumping her heart slowly decreased and they came out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit there and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or shout or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs. One-Laperuz mourned the loss of his daughter boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation he was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt overwhelming compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grief women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set up cards on the Wells Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as an contagious smile.
"They all remembered him for his smile.
People always said his smile could light every room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep afraid it will have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards “to let others know that there are people out there who can turn around and who they can talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davis' long-standing friend, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married 15 years after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said nothing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he did not look them in the eyes at all and establish any contact with them."
She said that his death is a major trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “This is the kind of thing that destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we have to keep going and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future has been uncertain since the FBI launched the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that looks like what he was looking for, that is, a limited-time investigation, with a limited range, we might be able to achieve a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee "is falling apart" in the conditions of a rooted partisan state.
Why didn't Cavanaugh and his Republican party supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their hesitation is due only to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, November 6th, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, on the other hand, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes at the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the unresolved outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees in North Korea "cut" under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, an MP from South Korea said.
Park Bjeong-seug, quoting data from the ministry of unification of South Korea, said last year there were 1,127 crossings at the border compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said that postrogal border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs for human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most North Korean refugees are eventually receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Korean people have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, which can be easily moved compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pjongyang to discuss topics that focused on the stalemate of the negotiations on non-denucularisation.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal -- the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho accused the sanctions imposed by the United States on stagnation in progress from then on Saturday.
"Until there is no trust in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security, and in such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "histero" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano "histerily" and said that if his temper is taken into account he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say it was "histeriful," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that she was sexually assaulted by Dr. Christine Blasi Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional at his opening presentation, sometimes even shouting and sobbing while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling allegations against him "the grotesque and co-ordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016's presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is proof that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because it has proved to be biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to take Cavanaugh down from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is in office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at D.C. County Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democratic she is concerned about possible verdicts that will bring Cavanaugh against the Law on Access to Health Care or Roe against Wade, because he is considered subject to conservative justice.
In hearings confirming his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "it's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's really harsh criticism, months and years of gathering anger that she can't free him from without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued, “I was very helped by a woman who had an executive post somewhere who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she managed to develop her technique, so when she started to cry, she told the person she was talking to,“ You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think it's genius."
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated it was once I started crying with inexplicable anger and an older woman, a cold manager from which I always had a certain fear, grabbed my neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder during that period was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987 when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well thought-out decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched a long time ago, she had not had enough funding, so she promised not to enter the race if she didn't raise $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During a speech that indicated that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overcome by emotions, or thanks to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that it was so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you'd seen me, you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder remembers how the media reacted to the incident.
"You would have thought that Klinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She's crying"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can be a good thing for Beijing
Opening the fire with the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening even though the battle is far from over, conflict between countries can be useful for Beijing on a long-term basis, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by postponing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation significantly escalated during this week by introducing new 200 billion-dollar goods tariffs (150 billion pounds) that effectively taxed half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing returned to nature each time, or recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to return the United States to the same extent, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up on the same thing anytime soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to accept his demands, but public bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Genping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, pressures from the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China in the long term because it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that by a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing, conditions can be created for the start of a sudden decline in economic aspect in any country is much more dangerous than previously established by observers," Abigail Grace, an research associate focusing on Asia at the New American Security Centre, which is a tink-tank.
Syria "prepared" for refugee return, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has remained devastated by a long war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the state to normal.
All conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally established economic measures that reflect on their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomed the aid in restoring the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe scored a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe beat the US team in Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
So far, the United States has lost six times in a European field and has not won the title of the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has regained the primate since Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, put a ball in the water at par-3 to the 16th hole in his first punch, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stressed in all circles, becoming one of the four players who achieved a score of 5-0-0 after the ongoing format tournament began to be organised in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest-ranked European team player, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest-ranking player in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, who may have played the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant of eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the top 25.5 points in the tournament during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy that I could help," the emotional Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He now gives up his countryman John Ram, who on Sunday one beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an amazing statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, with Jack Niklaus being ranked.
The team of the United States spent the weekend trying to direct the game towards low grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik after his team's disappointing game said "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
In one period this morning, we gave the team difficulties from Europe.
We fought.
A drop down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with America's Professional Golfers Association and our committee on the Ryder Cup and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
They overplayed us.
