I plan to skip lunch.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I prefer cats.
I prefer goat cheese from cow.
I prefer the eggs from the sub-type.
I prefer black.
I'd rather sit down.
I'd rather walk alone.
I must sound ridiculous.
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I hit him in the jaw.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I underlined the word "Alice" to point it out.
I suggested it.
I put three coffee spoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I gave up smoking throats.
I gave up.
I'm growing cattle.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really gonna get married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like the wine.
I like your website very much.
I really want your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss cooking for my mother.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'd love to learn French very much.
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I spit one out.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with them all.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister rip off the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
- Are you in the dark? - No.
I don't see any conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Everybody happy?
Everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats apples or bananas?
I waved my head off.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I have to take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should've checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Did you study outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Dadeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I gave him a slap.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a throat.
I slept in the can.
I slept on a bus.
I cut off the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this adventurous?
I kind of like it.
It's been snow cleaning all day.
Is she a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something strange.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Is that "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it worth it for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this place?
Is it really this diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Anybody sitting here?
Is this place open?
Is that what this is all about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow, I can't believe it yet.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Does Tom bother you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
You're starving to get down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I swam in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I spoke to my counselors about which items to take.
All that makes sense.
It's all looking aimless.
It always happens the same way.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
So, no, no, no.
It can't be!
It's about you.
It did a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never, ever could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
It disappoints him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
Doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
Looks like it's not helping.
Doesn't sound like anybody knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I teach him English.
It's just me.
That gave me an idea.
I've got a lot to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about her for days.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I've made a fine plea.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I'm wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's great.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a stickler.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's a mess.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done here.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd get him some help.
I thought I'd get them some help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was doing it.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you'll have a job up your throat.
Well, didn't you want the reward?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Well, don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were dating only girls who were lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
So you said you could swim?
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you were better at playing chess than I am.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
I'm in a terrible pain here.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet cap up.
It's a multiphase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna get this job done in one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't come in consideration.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a familiar paragraph of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong for me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
Seems familiar.
It looks like an egg.
I guess I drank too much yesterday, but I'm really hungover.
These two seem to be in a relationship again.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's what I got close to Tom.
You cut me off.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
It might seem strange.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It may rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetric.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get ugly.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm in my room.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
It rained two days ago.
You've resulted in a lot of difficulty.
I tried to explain it to him, but it didn't buckle.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's getting ready to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is recommended to check whether there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you are taking the medication prescribed for you.
It's a children's game.
That's a good system.
There's everything in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over soon enough.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She'll have to leave soon enough.
It's so much fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false clue.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad concrete doesn't burn.
It's fast enough on foot.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a wonderful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They've decomposed it.
It's just my troubles.
It's been coming back for a week, up and down.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It's best if you don't talk that much.
You better be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
Time to close.
He's studying here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily tell them apart.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me to be the only possible conclusion.
It looks very good in writing.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's mean to swear.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's getting dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It's gonna get cold.
It'll happen soon enough.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's okay.
It's getting better.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take too long.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made-up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That doesn't have much priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
That's not exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do this without much help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often someone who buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It snowed last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
It sounds really strong.
Sounds really good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's deep.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
There's still darkness out there.
He's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still bad.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's funny how people in the tropical areas eat seasoned food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
It's so strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
It doesn't support this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It relaxes a lot.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I guess not.
It's got wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to buzz.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and directed it to the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I rejected Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
It was a shame.
It was midnight.
It's been a long day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
Everything was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my duty to spend the night with a smart, funny, and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a hot night.
It's been a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
Such behavior was childish of him.
It was a mess.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
Yesterday was fun.
You were getting some sleep.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a beautiful gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been shown that the fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those who live on cats.
It was so great.
It was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was smoking a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Butter.
It was worth a shot.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
It's good work.
It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you immediately.
I used to keep you safe.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything that was to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone has always helped me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked them all.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked us a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overworked with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've had a lot worse.
They betrayed me.

Are you scared?
Were you home at 10:00?
Was he one of them?
We're your neighbors.
Were you being honest?
Was he compassionate?
Did you see that?
Was he with anyone?

I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.

You're allowed to come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul likes.

You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?

You got sick, right?
Do you happen to have a key?
You don't have much time left.

You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.

You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
I'm sure you already know the answer.
You look like you're getting a cold.

You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
You were lucky to have survived the attack.
