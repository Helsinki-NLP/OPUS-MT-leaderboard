Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they “look like maps”
Some members of the Assembly are amazed by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this may be the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party’s assembly said his party was concerned that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp”
For those who don’t speak Welsh: on Welsh twp means “stupid” and pwp means “how”
Plaid said the party was \"not happy\" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party was “freedomful” about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and “mapet” (Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter \"w\" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter \"u\"
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, said: “The final decision for any words to be appointed by the members of the Assembly, of course, will be made by the members themselves.”
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Wales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of public consultations on proposals that indicated great support for the appointment of the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from the public consultation.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus can cause headaches for the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of members of the Assembly and the design for the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the question of their name when they will discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\"
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for changing the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell fell silent as the churches in Harlem face problems
“Historically, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
\"Today, there's no one else.\"
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize in a different way today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer living rooms in neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of properties will not last as long as the leaders think, \"and sooner or later, they will return to the same place from which they began.\"
The churches, he added, can be replaced with residential buildings full of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white,” he said, “and that’s why the day when these churches will close completely will be accelerated because it’s unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by groups of whites before Harlem became a metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The congregation of black people who practice their faith nearby takes possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the congregation of blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the 125th Street vendors, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson's parish members had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon \"the bell of the poor.\"
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a different \"cultural treasure\" and \"an irreplaceable historical instrument\"
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger carillon at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marywater said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, a part brought by the unprofessional leaders of the church, and part of the bishoprical diocese.
The church board – the governing body of the church, composed of non-professional leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese “will seek to shift the costs” to the church board, although the church board was not involved in the employment of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the diocese.
Some members of the parish complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark Injuries 13-Year-Old Child When Diving for Lobster in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7:00 p.m. near Bikon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that he first thought it was a thrill from catching lobster, but then \"he realized that he was yelling, 'It bit me!
He bit me!”
The whole key bone looked at him, “Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
“I called for everyone to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the children's hospital Radi in San Diego, he was taken as a critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but they decided that the shark was not of dangerous kind.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed the beach on the side of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's take over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of department stores full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the beauty market in the UK, which weighs £2.8 billion, which continues to grow as sales in the field of fashion and household decline, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be presented in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets began looking for ways to take advantage of the space of shelves that was once intended for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said they would double the beauty offering for the first time to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its Boutique Makeup series so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Craydon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and purchasing smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cup, director of Sainsbury's, said stores would increasingly look like commodity houses as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's began putting stores on Argos in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which, they say, increased the sale of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreement about how to divide profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: \"We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a mandatory beauty destination that causes the old way of buying.
Peter Jones: Angry after Holly Willoby withdraws from $11 million deal
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den left \"angry\" after TV host Holly Willoby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoby has no time for their brand Truly for household products and accessories.
The couple's business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37-year-old morning programmer told Instagram she was leaving.
Holly Willoby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, withdrawing from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was \"angry\" when a television gold girl confessed during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - mean she no longer has time to devote herself to their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has been said to double Willoby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
As the 37-year-old Willoby told Instagram she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his cottages.
One source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-lasting future that she would send over the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all the affected caught her absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
In the Marlow headquarters there is a warehouse full of products that are ready for sale “
Experts believe that the departure of this host of the morning program, which is one of Britain’s most paid stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products from pillows and candlesticks, to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delay.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoby, the mother of three children, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones shares 40% of Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoby should become an ambassador to the brand for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity (I'm a star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We don’t comment on his business exploits.”
“We fell in love, and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media for commenting on what some would consider “unpresidential” and because it was so positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump has been redesigned as a “newscaster”.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump rated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “appropriate response” from the United States about North Korea’s early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
\"We agree with North Korea very well,\" he said.
“We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great collaboration.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results – missile tests have ended, helped free hostages, and the remaining U.S. troops have returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’ll have 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no elementary disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge,” Mr. Sumbung said.
Although “Save the children,” it is still not certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Due to the earthquakes that constantly hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best of times, traveling through many islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was to improve Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-elections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using martyrs, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Daniel Starge of Liverpool Team Equalizes against Chelsea
Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League with a goal in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Starage about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before pointing it to the distant tripod.
The ball moved high above the sixteen as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumped Keppa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
“He was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible,” Starage told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Cante approaching and I just touched her and I didn’t think much about it and I just shot her.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The \"blue\" striker filed his fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half the field, and then sprinting passed in half of Liverpool.
They quickly gave up with Kovačič in the middle of the field.
He then sent a missile, leading Hazard into the sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defense and finished the net on the far-flung tripod with a left-legged kick next to Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli at the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell in a 7.5-strong earthquake that hit Friday and caused 20-foot-high waves, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried by a shot from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched since a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Mersside.
The forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with a stab wound on Grayson Mows Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is at an initial stage, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead who have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in an object.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and as police have said, they will inform the victim's close people.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mows just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no entry was allowed, no exit from the building.
He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told they will spend hours before they can return.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
She keeps saying, \"It's so terrible.\"
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was out.
Many police officers stood in the cordon and watched the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters at 0800 555 111 citing a record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament has become the latest memory blow in the dispute of \"rewriting history\"
Its persecution would be poetic justice for its “Taliban” destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s Society described Mr. Creek’s proposal as “madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure before the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's beautiful presentation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider, perhaps, more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is the defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual-recognized figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning.
Pig-killer tears and kills Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name \"Juan\" was found dead with a removable artery, covered in blood near the cobblestone market in Liupanshui in Gitsou Province, South China, Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xing in Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pig's cognac.
He stated that there was a large walrus in the bone with the blood of the staunch.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a boar weighing £550 had broken the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
“My cousin’s leg was bloody and broken,” said the cousin, named ‘Wu’, according to a quote in Guayang’s evening news.
The security camera video showed Juan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs have been reported earlier that have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
A ten-year-old 650-pound pig besieged a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an activator.
“They’re just playing.”
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane of 5.00 hours east of Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to enter a large tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, a flow of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Large tropical moisture will cause rainfall that will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert on foot in the possibility of tropical rain.
Flooding rain can cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring a local flood to parts of the coast of Southern California.
There may be rains of more than half an inch, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain spread more late on Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will spread to “four corners” on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected all over the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, but tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures in 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our forecast for a longer period indicates the possibility of above average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavano's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony Thursday of the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault reportedly taking place in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the unprecedented political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular reverse programs at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, a Arizona senator, set up an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavano had taken her piano and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
More than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company averaged CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that were displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To show better, it is an audience of the size similar to the playoffs competition in football or the awards of the film academy.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavano’s appointment, led all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's play.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught his protestors calling him Friday morning as he tried to get into an elevator for the hearing of the court committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being reviled, and all this was being transmitted live to CNN.
“They’re standing in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth on earth?”
He was told, “You have power, and so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the court committee was due to vote for Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was a deal with the FBI that he would consider the charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and with a few senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"playing politics\" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for \"playing politics\" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called \"Chekers\" plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the mutual costs was \"totally absurd.\"
Fire in Wade Sims: police arrest suspect Dieteon Simpson for death of state university athlete at Louisiana State University
Police have arrested a suspect in Wade Sims' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
The 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, a WAFB partner told CBS.
After being questioned by Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killed him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
East Baton Rouge's pathologist's office released a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head of the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the state police crime lab, the South University police and the citizens of the area for the assistance they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Athletics Director at Louisiana State University thanked police for its \"activation in search of justice\"
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot bet grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 balls per game in the final season.
On Friday morning, basketball team coach at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team had been “destroyed” and “in shock” since Sims’ death.
“That’s what you worry about all the time,” said the coach.
Volcano throws ashes at Mexico City
The ejection of ash from the Popochatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after a crater activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by more rumblings and shocks.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysics have seen an increased activity of the volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters clashed with police for public order and peace, and after thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote to secede.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later in the day, fighting broke out, and the police used their thumbs to suppress the fighting.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups shouted, “There is no forgetting, no forgiveness,” and on the other hand, the union protesters shouted, “For a long time to live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterized the referendum on October 1 as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low due to boycott by people who oppose secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
The sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has a chance of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the dynamics of this year with many of their most famous leaders either in self-elected persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, recorded a police-backed protest, saying the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
“It’s getting intense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed before a trial last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners arrested after driving a car into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after re-entering a car in a Londonbury house.
The incident took place in Ballinagard Kressent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the gate and the building itself was caused.
At some point, it could have been shot with an arrow from a self-shooter to a car.
Menga's goal won Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston to win
The advanced Livingston entered the Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as the manager of the club Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be significant while Gary Hold's side rose to one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side has run out of guests in the championship this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they fall behind with eight points.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone continued unbeaten in the division during six matches, and coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston Missed the Chance of Brutal Guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before they scored, and their directness caused many problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Littgov could only direct his efforts far away after sliding his head into Craig Halkett's head over the goal.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems with the actions set up.
That’s how the goal came.
Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingstone received an opening, namely, Deacon Gallagher and Robinson set Menga together, who only touched the goal from the center of the sixteenth.
Until then, Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break the host's defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not play for the most part.
The scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of the skill of Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set action by Livingston.
Livingston’s sixteenth-century man was constantly passing through and was constantly defended, while two penalty requests – after arguing with Hallcat about Glen Middleton’s replacement and one for hand-to-hand play – were rejected.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasder Lamont of the BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic game and result for Livingston
They were great, continuing to exceed the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of play have hardly changed since their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hallkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Conor Goldson and Joe Waral ready.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerard’s leadership, they now fall behind the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they were able to open the hosts – and it was a little awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Receives Mixed Reception in Colonnai
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
They have deteriorated due to problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Kolonya to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also voted, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposite protesters reflect the visitor's division celebrated as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died after a car crash in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of the streets of Beswood and Evelyn, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash took place months after another cyclist’s death in a car accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Blockages have been put on the road and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison police officers were injured in a men's prison with a high level of security, the prison's office said.
The riots erupted at HMP Long Martin in Worcestshire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
The Special Forces of the tornado unit were brought in to resolve the riots, which included eight prisoners and were limited to one wing.
Police officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
The prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were instructed to deal with the current HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was announced that the governor of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious riots in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (can be useful for dry areas)
There is rarely a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely that this will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, causing a risk of sudden flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flegstaf, Las Vegas, and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move on a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or depression within a range of 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!”
Catharina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches at the edge of Mongolian.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas for sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to benefit as the southwestern region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Sushi Tracking Authority, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s course led to landslides everywhere on the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still strong on Sunday morning with winds of a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with cold waters in the Pacific and decreases.
Rainfalls are expected in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rain in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“A rain is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain,” said Weather.com.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move upwards across Arizona and in southern Utah by the late evening hours of Tuesday.
“The main danger expected of Rosa or its remains is the very heavy rains in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States,” the State Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and flows of debris, as well as landslides to the mountainous regions.
Midsamer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in a “stable” state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have asked if anyone has any cell phone footage from the incident to stand out.
Trump said Kavano \"has suffered the greatest malice and anger\" of the Democratic Party.
“A vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the most cruel and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavano \"suffered the biggest malice and anger\" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before the congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blassi Ford's accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and at her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.”
“The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the early elections.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not running, but I’m really fighting,” he said.
\"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates.\"
Trump says Democrats have a mission to “resist and hinder”
The first key vote for the nomination of Kavano in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the senior head of the GOP told CNN.
Hundreds dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of casualties is increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many have been taken from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves 6 metres (18 feet) high hit the shore of sunset, behaving many in safe death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5-strong earthquake, a tsunami hit.
“When the threat of a tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a BNPB spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency in a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come on its own, dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos of air released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, curved and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the energy released from the Hiroshima nuclear bomb in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, is possible to increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as \"obstructed\" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the shot of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication \"was completely damaged without any information\" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had come approximately at the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, one can hear a man on the upper floors of a building screaming madly, warning people on the street down about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water is stuck on the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The airport was reopened for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees sheltered themselves in cedar shelters in the yard of their office, they walked through scenes of wasteland, Mr. Dosaba said.
\"They told me they saw many houses destroyed,\" he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began dark attempts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to come if the site of the disaster has been declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but there is still no status.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was besieged under a shot for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliderists for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
The others stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, when he began to circulate the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of paragliderists, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended up only with a gray sign of tickling, instead of a son.
\"I think that means the messages are not delivered,\" he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when charging an ATM at the “Newport Cave”
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee on Friday morning, who was supplementing an ATM at Newport's \"Newport on the Key,\" according to a Newport police station press release.
The driver of the car emptyed the ATM in the fun complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While busy, another man “run from behind a Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Jay
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yei.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: “The creature formerly known as Kanye West”
Forty-one-year-old West wore the nickname Yei for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred just before his Saturday Night Live guest, where he is expected to release his new album “Yandhi”.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to cancel for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Although he used it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘hee’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means ‘you’,” West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with Radio host Big Boy.
“What it means is me, it’s me, it’s me, it’s us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only, to only Yei, reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, Pi Didy or Didy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without a dash and all the big letters.
Mexico’s AMLO pledges not to use the military on civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody repressions on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolko Plaza that “he would never use the army for repression of the Mexican people”.
The army shot peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its field research funding, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranked U.S. oil player, and later served as director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee thanked for previous matches after U.S. government technology as a challenge in the Agency’s robotics for advanced research projects in defense and asked when the next match would be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that ‘green cards’ should be offered automatically to doctors of science by artificial intelligence,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other governmental organizations distribute money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an AI committee.
DARPA announced a $2 billion investment this month for an initiative called ‘AI Next’
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation demanding the creation of a National Commission for the Security of Artificial Intelligence has had no effect for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\" a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to its territory and veto its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Orthodox population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50% needed for the referendum's validity.
The question of the referendum paper was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece”.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the break-up of Yugoslavia.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Gjorgievska, 79.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1pm.
However, turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
\"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,\" said 62-year-old Gjoshe Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their vote in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov, prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in with our heads high, not from the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
“I believe that the majority will be because more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said the result \"yes\" would be \"confirmation of our future\"
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since they came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has passed Brighton's entire goal defense.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed between the three defenders of Brighton before entering the open ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four \"greens\"
He bypassed a defensive player before running a few others to the edge of Brighton's sixteen.
He then filed to the left of him, Sterling.
The English striker used his first approach to the sixteenth to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right side of the network.
“Aguero has leg problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored in that moment.”
But the initial advantage of “the blues of heaven” was given by Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero won a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before taking Sterling to the far end.
The attack on the blue sky brought the ball into the net before it got out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a 12.55 Champions League group on Tuesday at the Rhine-Nekhar Arena, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockis
Since Nashnels were eliminated from the playoffs fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the competitive Sherzer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still playoffs for the Rockis team, who lead a match before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockis's team had at least a \"joker\" for a 5-2 win over Nashnells on Friday night, but they still struggle to establish their place in the first division.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, at least we’ll be able to throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any moment I’m going to face this year.
Why I don’t want to compete in that.”
Nesnells is still due to announce a starter on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to throw in such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start the 34th time, was training to throw on Thursday and would throw usually rested on Sundays.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 straight points in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavano to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be put on the line in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, so I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see these terrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, by seeing the malice, by being rude.
They don’t care who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we won’t give them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to \"give resistance and hinder\"
\"And you see it in the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"angry, evil, rude, and untrue.\"
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein from the ranks of the Democrats, appointed by the Senate Court Committee, in his name, to which the audience reacted with shouts of resentment.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, what?
No, no, wait a minute - it was a very bad body speech - the worst body speech I've ever seen.
Scientists no longer accept different opinions.
Not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
When the activists of Momentum voted against me in my local party, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in the line of members of the Labour Party who are told that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he took a decisive stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censoring movement criticized me for disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues Jeremy disagreed on with previous leaders.
Nottingham’s Eastern Labour Party said that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party’s parliament, the council’s meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, that’s not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of “favorable, gentle” politics has long been forgotten, if indeed it has ever begun.
It becomes increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would never otherwise take, whether it be national security or the EU's internal care.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there is a critical abuse of social media that calls for condemnation, denial of the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one with that kind of experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great admiration for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions, and with every request for “failure trust” or change of selection rules, the party becomes with narrower opinions.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then \"it's gonna be okay.\"
That’s not why I came into politics.
32 years ago when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the carelessness of the Thatcher government that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed it most, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes to Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemning threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I consider to be in the best interest of all of you.

Air 38 – 17 Melrose: The Undefeated Ear Goes to the Top
The two late points may have changed the final score to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match on the day of the Scottish Championship in rugby.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as to their improved chances, which the domestic team took, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested through our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Ear, they have taken better advantage of their chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of Warriors, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggotte grabbed an unconverted point.
Air conditioning delayed Air's lead with a penalty, previously, exactly in half, he scored a point, and converted a solo point to reach 17 to 5 for Ear in rescue.
But Melrose well started the second half, and Patrick Andreson's point, converted by Bag, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long detention due to a serious injury to Ruard Nott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and from the beginning, Ear continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDovell, converted by Klimo.
Ear's WD captain, Blair McPherson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team regained and when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card to topple Klimo without the ball, McPherson pulled a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took the hit on David Armstrong and sent the winged player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
Still Game star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiran appears ready to move to the hospitality industry after it was discovered to be named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The fifty-six-year-old starring Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, on which he is a screenwriter and starring together with his longtime partner in the comedy, Greg Hamfil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last and it looks like Kirnan is planning for life after Craigling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun said Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow’s “successful restaurant trade”.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol at an undercover naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued with the motto: “The sea is ours rightly.
It is a duty to return to us.
Through mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict of resources is still fresh, as is longing to sail again after the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the international court on October 1st after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive outcome is expected,” said Roberto Calsadia, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision-making of the international court on large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also depends quite on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s favor and that it won’t change much even if it decides in their favor.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to allocate territory to Chile and has said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The ruling of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
In the last four years, they may have reversed Bolivia’s cause rather than improved it.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes,” Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, Bolivian representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia \"an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile\" and the opportunity to \"end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,\" he said.
Kalsadia also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the problem of the sea as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur if it cannot trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was “fiction” to consider the continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean war to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to a declaration without Pyongyang first to take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows discover the latest line of massive hats that’s on the way to the biggest shops in your area
If you want to improve the size of your collection of hats or completely block the sun, then do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have discovered a series of crazy too big hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations that fall into the eyes of the runway.
The piece that Valentino pointed out was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide stitch in the form of feathers that flooded the model's head.
Other too large supplements included watermelons with zirconia, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment completely with glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a melted root ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to the shops near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a stitch of two feet that all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski carry.
The cult fashion house behind the too impractical hat that spread through social media sent another big creation along the runway, a straw beach bag almost equal to the height of the model that drew it.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia and a white leather handle, was the piece that was featured in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques on the Fashion Week in Paris.
The stylist, Luke Armitage, told the FYROM: “I expect to see the big beach hats and bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which only reinforces with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement custom school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as an elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he will do so in his own right.
“If you speak to him in his own language, he will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can notice that languages exceed all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of 5+.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher rating of “5+” in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved “5”.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools programs, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 O.C. Employment and Skills Commission survey found that for the reasons that employers failed to fill jobs, 17% were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give preference to the polyglot before competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in the OK when viewed in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that prepares children and will arm them with the skills necessary for success, no matter what the future brings.
At present, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be painted in schools.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
\"Il faut bien le faire\" (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to lead Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James launch for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first preseason match against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play, it has not yet been decided.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers’ official website.
A reporter for the Lakers, Mike Trudel, tweeted that James is likely to play a limited time.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before Lakers.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
YouTube Channel for Trump's rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump has launched a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled rallies in the coming week, including visits to predispositions such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the empty seat in the Supreme Court is at rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections amid the mandate, as Republicans may lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern coastal time zone tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online by live streaming on YouTube.
This week it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected delay in the Senate vote for up to a week, while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
The primary goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans get momentum for the November elections.
Thus, from President Trump’s campaign, these five rallies next week are aimed at “inciting volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible with the start of the campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be named, said.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight’s rally can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to news from the West Virginia Metro.
On Saturday, Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
\"It is not good for Morrissey that the president must come to improve the popularity of the polls,\" said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
U.S. Cup Raider 2018: U.S. team has shown courage in the fight to keep alive hopes at the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the four Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what the Rider Cup needed.
The perversion of happiness is a completely fictional sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would say that happiness is now?
\"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're lucky I guess,\" Jordan Spitt said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, of four points and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in their sails even though they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day long and each scored three points of four.
Spit was great and leads by example.
Those strong hymns of celebration became stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the levelling of four or four when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His kick that he won at 15 was greeted with a similar shout, telling you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
“You just have to get deeper and take care of your game,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for every player now.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Rider Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe is four out of four and can’t be wrong.
“Molliwood” was the only couple without a bad hit on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the previous nine on Friday morning.
It series and the way it seems to flow their energy to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, except Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is preferred to both at the same time on different holes.
However, talks about European fame remain unjustified.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he merged with Alex Norren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the top nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to watch from close up because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they don’t listen to, and the way strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved considerable leadership on the last day, but the season of four also showed that the U.S. team could fight even though some, especially Americans, suspected.
Europeans lead 10-6 on the last day of the Raider Cup
Europe will enter a solid advantage on the last day of the Raider Cup after Saturday's lead in double pairs and fours of 10-6 in front of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National on four points.
Thomas Björn's European team, who was struggling to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the U.S. team, which had many failures in the morning doubles and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans gave more resistance to the four, winning two matches, but could not reach the lead.
Jim Furrick's team needs eight points from 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called \"Molliwood\" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in the first four competitions in the history of the Raider Cup.
After \"swept\" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat the worn-out Woods and American beginner Bryson DeShambu with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who ran through two matches on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning doubles lasted, returned as Henry Stanson's partner in the 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kotka, ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all after their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winnings Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for Americans on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in doubles and returned later to defeat the Pulter and Rory McCleroy with 4&3 in four, but lost to the initial, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cup has a team recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as the winner of the title, Furrick's team had enough equal score to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says there is “no chance” of disarming unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the prolonged sanctions deepened the mistrust in the United States and that there was no chance that the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken \"significant measures of goodwill\" last year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"However, we do not see an adequate response from the United States,\" he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's resistance to access to nuclear disarmament \"in stages\" that would gradually reward North Korea for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not refuse unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit at the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula” while Trump gave a guarantee of North Korea’s security.
North Korea demands a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to comply with strict international sanctions on North Korea.
\"The United States insists on \"nuclear disarmament above all else\" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes the \"declaration for the end of the war,\" Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is an in vain dream of people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: \"If the other side had been South Korea instead of the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have ended up in such a dead end.\"
Despite this, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from last year’s, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocketer” with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said that there remains much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, \"Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.\"
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council sanctions must continue fully and without exceptions until full, finally nuclear disarmament is confirmed.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only after a few hours due to “gangster demands”.
North Korea commits to a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile plant, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He said Kim told him “the appropriate measures” he is looking for are the security guarantees Trump has made in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing macho-culture of learning by staying up all night with the help of caffeine.
Researchers have found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing about basic self-care.
Charles Chaizler, a dream professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designs a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said that no one, never told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic outcomes, and improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student’s home where students press on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how insufficient sleep affects athletic results and the importance of the routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette,” said Professor Chaseller.
The culture of pride with \"working all night\" still exists, he said, and in addition, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, should be the \"secret weapon\" of the student in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to move into a fasting regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circadian rhythm, which leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga goal topples Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's blow sent Steven Gerard's ragged team to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Aybrox's team wanted to register their first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the missing lead team Harts in the Scottish First League.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and Rangers' lineup lost inspiration and chances of leveling up.
Now Rangers have fallen sixth, and Livingston has gone third and are only behind Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after Line Judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after he was apparently hit by a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 Livingstones who won a point with Harts last week and would be happy about the way his well-trained line-up choked opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score, two minutes after Menga's first play took Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then a blow from a distance to Qihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Hallkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed there was more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get a penal in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lawles collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not give approval to the Colombian appeal.
Rangers were able to score only two shots at the goal in the first half, but Aybrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get wet with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak blow of These Edaria.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been the opposite of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it according to their game.
Again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs's blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Deacon Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga as a simple ending.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgow and Hackett catching many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set himself up well and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head after the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, had yet another penalty request after he collided with Jacobs, but Thompson did not approve.
Almanac: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now one side of our almanac “On Sunday morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REMOVE ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Gajger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as a gyger counter.
Since then, it has become a major stronghold of science, the geiger counter has become a major stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Bell of Colorado, in which these seemingly unconvincing, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform:
Man: “What is it again?”
Rogers: “It’s a gyger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “Say, it’s probably jumping now”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “watch” the alien cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the alien cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the alien cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their alteration to the laboratory.
You can “see” protein common in many cancers and then return to the body.
The vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the alien cells, the cancer of the ovaries disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can “watch” protein common in many types of cancer called HER2 and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer from Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 “promoted the growth of several cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal cancer,” said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and their “leuking” how to target cancer cells works when treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump drop, wearing a drop with his motto, after a live performance on Saturday night.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night after a useless performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After the performance of the third song that night, called Ghost City, where he wore a cap with the inscription To Make America Famous Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“When I talk to a white man, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“If I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday night's live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavano's testimony to the Senate's legal affairs committee, linked to allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blacey Ford.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, West’s footage was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time going behind the scenes because of his drop.
“They made fun of me behind the scenes.
They said, \"Don't show up with that drop.\"
They made fun of me!
Then they told me that I was in a sinking place, he said, according to Washington Egzeminer.
The news continued: “You want to see the sunken place,” he said, “put your superman cap on, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?
Try it with love.
His comments attracted outrage from the audience at least twice, and the team on the evening show looked embarrassed, according to Varyetti, a man told the publisher: “The whole studio is gone.”
West was brought in as a replacement at the last moment for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
News surprised many with the performance of the song “I Love It” dressed as a bottle of Perryr.
West received support from TPSAD’s conservative group leader, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the most courageous spirits: I thank you for being put to death by the crowd.”
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was her own and it was absolutely beautiful”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) for which I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now \"formally known as Kayne West\"
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didy's steps, also known as Puff Deedy, Puff and P Didy.
The rapper's colleague, Snap Dog, has the name Snap Lyon and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist previously known as Prince.

The star of the series Game of Thrones, Keith Harington, attacked the toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, when he stated that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be strong to be respected.
In a statement about the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believes that “something is wrong” and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #now I say era.
Keith, who recently married the star of Game of Thrones, Rosie Leslie, 31, admitted that he had “strong feelings” on the matter.
“I personally have strong feelings, at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculineness?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What do you learn from TV and what on the street, what makes young boys feel they have to have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that \"end with battles and horses\"
As of November, Keith will perform in the restoration of Sam Shepherd's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that what he met his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me my future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played The Game, a character who had a love attraction with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won the Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people suffering from HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data presented by a member of staff related to a Republican party senator as “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on the pages of Wikipedia lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were “ultra-right” sympathizers and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information reportedly includes the home address and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate panel lasted to hear allegations of sexual misconduct against Bret Kavano, nominated for a Supreme Court judge.
The information was released shortly after Kavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redsteit have announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the announcement is linked to Waters’ office and information about a member of Waters staff has been released.
“These unfortunate accusations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My staff member – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those false and false accusations – is in no way responsible for the information provided.
Unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.
Waters’s statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Flasher.
“These denials are nervous,” Flasher wrote.
“This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It cannot be challenged.
He must not ask about the defendant’s motives.
He must remain calm and calm.
Fletcher appeared to have compared Waters's reaction to critics associated with Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics for looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in mid-term elections, also tweeted.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed \"the authorities and the police about the false claims.
“We will allow criminals to be found,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English's Opinion Attacks Again - Destroys Rowan Atkinson's Spy Scams
It is now traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new film with a British connection, and this seems to apply to this restoration of the franchise of the scammer, action comedy Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: Reborn.
Does careful self-expression about how obvious we are to nowhere be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Despite all this, the face with large eyes and many make-up of incompetent Johnny English got the license to “burn” things for the second time - his name above all indicates that he is a comical creation with a wide scope, made for viewers in cinemas in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamor after a little like Cluzo, has traits of Mr. Bean and a part of the boy who plays a note from the song Kochii on the fire from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
His foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson, who once performed in Barclays's now-forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor's fins hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift of physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since “serious” film brands such as 007 and Impossible Missions themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be intended for children instead of adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy accidents are not as inventive and focused as the silent pieces of Bin's character Atkinson's.
The topic that goes on all the time is that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated the super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, disappointing the agent on duty - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompezy and fighting figure and is already suffering from a complete melting of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson is doing his best in this image of Quasi-Terreza-May, but there is nothing special in the script that would work.
Her intelligence advisors have informed her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling Johnny English himself, who now works as a private school teacher, but \"black\" gives hours for secret agents: there are a few good boys here, when English offers a spying school that resembles a rock academy.
English was quickly called to whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Bow, who played Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, regarding a submarine commander, a comical role in which Wiki Pepperdin is not well-used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all things in the Royal Secret Service, are back in action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: they re-create as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a wasteland after smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht of the Volta; and English begins a real anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
All brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as polite and noisy as it is, there is a lot of children's TV throughout the film.
Nice moderate stuff.
As with other movies with Johnny English, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would take advantage of his talent?
Labour denies making plans for British workers to work four days a week, but pay for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week – but they will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give another day off to workers.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea \"answers\" with the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more inclined to workers.
The transition in a four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking member of the party told the Sunday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that is in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated for a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party does not consider such an idea.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of \"faceless directors\" and \"profits\" in utilities.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadows also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make \"deductions\" due to unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the board of companies and to create Inclusive Property Funds, which would allow 10 percent of private company capital to belong to employees, who would be able to take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy makes a “60 Minutes” statement on whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change its mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavano postponed the final vote for his nomination at the Supreme Court for at least a week and updated the question of whether the bureau's findings could change some Republican senators' minds to withdraw their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would force them to reconsider.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I think so,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out and I said, \"Did you do it?\"
He was firm, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, looks like carved in stone.
\"My decision has been made for Brett Kavano and a shocking accusation is needed,\" he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it energetically,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blacey Ford.
“Everyone she named couldn’t confirm.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual musical event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now being held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012 is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must meet several tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, telephone call, or any other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a Golbal citizen because they stayed 12 years to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to look for something or just another case of “click-activism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “activities” from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped encourage world leaders to hint at commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements as a result of their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have a direct influence on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in Britain, dedicated to “helping children harness their potential” which promised to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help with the country’s undernutrition after they received 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
“With support from the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens the same as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a note in history,” Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Nutrition told a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been undertaken to improve the diet of mothers and children in Britain, the government has announced funding for the project, the Power of Ishranta, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen said, “It’s going to be a long and hard way – we’ll never make it.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janet Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a “blockade” to prevent Russia’s energy exports – the Interior Ministry
Washington may \"if necessary\" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinkki said.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria – namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a front for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they’re in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just like they’re doing in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
\"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, blockages to prevent their energy from reaching the market,\" he said.
Zinkki addressed the participants at an event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that presents itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it was effectively the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stakes and replacing fuels,” he said, while talking about Russia as “one awkward pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the “inappropriate” North Tex 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic meters pipeline, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s firm opposition to the project is for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
\"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers,\" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance met with resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kemf, the first person of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will \"carefully consider\" whether to run for president in 2020, said Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “carefully consider whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.”
During a meeting in the city hall in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman on the forehead,” Hill said.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider running for president.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the city council and said he was \"leading the country in the wrong direction.\"
“I’m too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said \"of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote\"
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a study by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globes Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent support such an application.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting a potential nomination, and 48% against it.
Other famous Democratic party names discussed in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About Trek Palin’s Straumatic Syndrome at Donald Trump’s Summit
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“As my son goes through what he’s been through since he got back, I know how other families feel that are torn apart because of the more traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest an \"elephant in the room\" and said her son and other war veterans \"they come back a little different, they come back tight, they come back and wonder if there's any respect for what they and their airmen, and every other member of the army gave to the country.\"
He was arrested on Monday in Vassila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by an assault on a woman, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for police in Vassila.
18 U.S. states and the city of Washington support dispute over new asylum policy
18 states and the city of Washington support a new U.S. policy that prevents asylum from victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition with the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who disputes politics.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner \"and the violent members of his gang\" abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of asylum applications in the United States originate, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the 2014 Immigrant Appeals Board’s decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington's public defender Carl Racin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"ignors decades of law-making at state level, federally and internationally\"
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum requirements be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request, and such a provision violates that principle – according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter argue that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering is detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary workforce”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“There is asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Rescue efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
\"It's very tense,\" said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There is no clean water.
Residents return to their destroyed homes and choose from their guided objects to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came into his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “mill-treatment” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page commercial in the U.S. daily newspaper listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's paid add-on in De Moin Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper -- after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. Congress election on November 6th, China dropped the indictment.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked a merger with US officials for Reuters, a new phase in Washington’s escalation campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war that aligns tariffs on imports with each other.
China's retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at exporters from states like Iowa, which are backed by Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Terry Branstadt, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime Iowa governor, China's main exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing is hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstadt wrote in a column in a Sunday issue of De Moin Register, \"now doubles the abuse of propaganda ads in our free press.\"
“In the de-escalation of propaganda, the government of China abuses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by posting advertisements in De Moin Register,” Branstadt wrote.
“On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China’s problematic economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that \"one of the most read newspapers in China has rejected his offer of publication\" to the column, although he did not say what newspaper it was.
Republicans move away from women's votes ahead of mid-term elections, over a debacle with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are silently watching or defending Bret Kavano's nomination at the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already stated that they want to continue voting.
There is no going back,” wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Maxwell College at the University of Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he suspected that the FBI's investigation into Senator Jeff Flake would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, ahead of Washington D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming” in protest in the Senate corridor, when Republicans, who are in control of the Legal Affairs Commission, decided to continue the nomination of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blacey Ford’s testimony.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be high,” said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst on the news site.
“People say they’re tall; that’s right.
But they can be taller, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
\"This has become a major mess for the Republican party,\" said Michael Steele, a former president of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to news from the NBC.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or the last vote, or whether Kavano will go to the hearing, it’s also about the way Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps in the election of Democrats, about the news channel.
However, Americans are divided around who to trust after Ford and Kavano’s testimony, although a larger number accept the first-member side.
A new U-Gov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavano probably or definitely lied about the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one others, Deborah Ramirores, the Guardian said.
Ford testified in front of the Senate Legal Affairs Commission, under oath last week that Kavano had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court judge of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Network inventor plans to launch new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Network, is starting a startup business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company built on the open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s intent was “world domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up business.
“Now is the historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “data warehouse” or abbreviated POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlux, Slack and Spotify to all available on a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal storage of data on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it “personal strengthening through data”.
The idea of Inrapt, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers with a project work agreement and a community of coders-volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change where their business models were completely turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrapt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortium of the World Network of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesperson in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Wide Web, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m a big optimist for the new era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous winner of the Victorian Cross of the First World War
The only priest of the Anglican Church who won the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received the award on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellengliz and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he had received the highest British military decoration.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was \"an incredible symbolism\" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentine “Across a very dense fog and under a strong fire of cannons and machine guns”.
He later ran to the places where he was shot and with the “greatest courage” he led forward, before attacking a gun nest himself, and disabling three of his servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were \"something I know I'll never be able to do, but it's something that makes us humble.\"
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Young Imperial Band.
Michael Van said that \"it is a great honor for him to be part of the parade\" and added \"the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people\"
Fans of combined martial arts remained awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead of getting Pepa Pig
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching Belator 206 without being able to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that were displayed live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were horrified when the canal shifted to Pepa Prasse.
Some were not impressed after being awake until the early hours due to the struggle.
One of Twitter fans described the transfer of a children's cartoon as \"some painful joke\"
“The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of the Belator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
\" Pepa Pigs - Yes \"
Belator President Scott Cooker said he would work on a schedule that would include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about letting go again, I think we can probably find a solution,” Cooker said.
\"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages when we moved, and none of them were favored.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We will limit the number of five fights, instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to deliver more for the fans and overdo it.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a Desert Island: Tom Daley felt \"inferior\" because of sexuality
Olympic bouncer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everyone is like me”.
Speaking on the first show Discs on a desert island on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-time Kirsty Young show, took a months-long vacation for illness.
Appearing as a side character in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt \"less\" than everyone else as he grew up \"it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls.\"
He said: “Until this day, those feelings of lower value and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The Olympic man with two bronze medals became a famous supporter of the LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 – “we are surprised”
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years old last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at an early age,” he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that \"all his views\" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be here to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew this was what I dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – Pride of Heather Smoll – to turn to his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he still struggled.
Discs on a desert island on BBC Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British Summer Time.
Michaelson, the horse is out of shape, was on the bench during the Raider Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays at the 47th Cup of Raider, but will have to change the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Michelson, who played at the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furrick during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as is often represented by the United States, the five-time winner, he divided the time to cheer and practice his game, the range, with the hope of correcting what he is holding back.
He was never the best leader, not even at the top of his career, a 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National playground, where distant rough kicks are a regular punishment for negligence.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Michelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who plays in pairs with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who miss four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Michaelson’s game can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
“He fully understands the role he played today, touches my back and puts his hand around me and says he will be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is part of the famous and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think of him as playing two games.
I imagined more, but it passed, and we thought that's what we had to do.
He likes to play, like everyone else.
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played matches at the Rider Cup on Sunday.
It can be the end of a career at the Raider Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halves, although Furick said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s sensitive, he wants to joke with people, and he’s a great guy at team meetings,” he explained.
“I think younger players were having fun playing with him, as was this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers more than just a game.
European captain Thomas Björn knows the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead ahead of individual matches in the last day of the Raider Cup can easily be turned into a no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
The Dane debuted in a 1997 Valderama match, when Steve Ballesteros led a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but \"crossed the line to the goal only with the noses\" with the smallest lead of 141-2-131-2.
“I remind myself that we had a great lead in Valderama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, when we lost in Valderama, when we won for a little while,” said Björn, the painter, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with Le Golf National’s 10-6 lead.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play it right.
This is not over as long as the game is over.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on it.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opponent side - the best players in the world \"
Björn added: “I don’t want to give early grades on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow, we’re looking forward to individual games, and that’s a different thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then you test all the abilities as a golfer.
This is the message to be sent to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he has to do his best.”
Unlike Byrne, opponent Jim Furrick will ask players to play better individually than they played in doubles, with exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was at both ends of the changes on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser when Europe performed “The Miracle in Medina”.
\"I remember every word there,\" he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, united the players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the midfielders.
We set the line accordingly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to make magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of confronting first and confronting Rory McCleroy the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
“I decided to perform this way with the guys because I think that’s how we’re going to cover everything,” Björn said of the choice in individual games.
The new German warship has been postponed again.
The latest frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be delivered in 2014 to replace the outdated warships of the Cold War, but this would not happen until next year due to the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the \"Rhineland-Falz\" ship from the new class of frigates Baden-Wittemberg has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Di Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but problematic issues after delivery prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wittemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth-technology, as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is the rarest maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent up to two years from the domestic ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships – which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans – will be obsolete by the time they enter service.
Fregated by an unfortunate fate, the F125 reached its front page last year, when the German Navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of key “software and hardware defects” that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly important because ships from the Baden-Wittemberg class would have a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
\"Rhineland-Falz\" weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - a rise from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frigates are particularly important due to warnings of Germany's reduced naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, confirmed that the navy \"has disappeared ships that can be deployed\"
The representative said the problem worsened over time, as the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wittemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust is Listening to the Secret Life of the Bats
A new study of property in the Scottish mountainous regions is carried out in order to discover how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that the findings will give answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help lead protection activities in the future.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano-lilies, as well as the coffee bats with long ears and the daubenton bats at Inverou Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The staff of En-Eich-Ess and volunteers will also carry mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of sounds from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the species of bats.
Then a map with habitats will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, a nature conservation adviser at En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction works and development that affect the beds and the loss of habitats.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as well as adhesive strips for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren’t really blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of echo-location to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Ess, who cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspections of beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Triv estate in Humphreys and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“Here in Triv we have a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us to learn more about what they need to make progress.”
He stressed that it is important to check if there are bats before property renovations are carried out because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Bat Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, “We still need to learn a lot about bats and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape \"fake news\" and added that people \"want to promote themselves\" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which announced the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram live video to 142 million followers, hours after accusations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed reports as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was reported today is fake news,” the five-time gold ball winner told his camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything’s fine,” added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges they called \"unacceptable transfer of suspicions from private life,\" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherz said the player would seek damage because of \"moral damage in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.\"
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a hotel and a Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claimed Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent” “a good boy” but had fallen below that “one percent”.
Ronaldo said he had sex, but there was an agreement.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a non-judicial agreement because she was afraid of revenge – and was worried “that she would be publicly disgraced”.
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to reverse the deal because she has traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid by Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus with a $100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain “will always regret” losing car manufacturers
Britain \"will always regret\" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was \"disturbing\" that Toyota-Britain had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
Japan’s automaker said border congestion in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a stop to production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other car makers in Britain have expressed concern about how leaving the EU without a deal would operate cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-Wee and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-Em-Wee, for example, said he would close his mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the system “exactly on time” with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there can be a break at the border that, according to industry, can cause delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a daily inventory stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was \"precisely made to avoid such border checks\"
“We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will give us not only success in which we will enjoy the present, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 today’s program.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would have been stopped, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the trade union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman: “We have put together a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House said.
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as he continues to fight Bret Kavano’s nomination as a judge at the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the potential violation of the laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thus threaten Miller's independence, prompts gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was in the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he “wouldn’t want to” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash at the Senate Judicial Committee hearing, which both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacey Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI on lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see how things go, and I always try to keep the press properly informed.”
Some journalists challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for reporters at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of briefings were not due to a lack of \"great influence\" on television journalists, although he added: \"I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence.\"
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
\"The president organizes multiple sessions of questions and answers from any president before him,\" she said, adding no evidence: \"We've looked at those figures\"
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but \"if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it's far better than talking to me.
We try to do this more often and you are witnessing that we have been doing it constantly over the past few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace briefings for journalists.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York City, the president may have shown why this is the case with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Secretary by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system on Brexit-related fears
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, an MP to the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the costs of resolved applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Ms Freeman wrote in his letter: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued throughout the summer, in order to make the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of not reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The colleagues from all over the EU share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of useful importance to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombies undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the defensive player of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury to the game on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
\"He reached the side line of the playground and he was just scraping on the ground,\" Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombies outside the playground and then put it in a stretcher and carried it to a further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had gone out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is still no information on the type/degree of the injury” and “Tennesee State” is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombie is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red jersey at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five shootouts on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 knockouts this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK
Under Tory's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will neutralize Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional funds strengthening the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount which, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-residents, which led to price increases and caused difficulties for people buying property for the first time to engage in this process of buying property.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spiritual cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to cut the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of offering high prices to land-holding properties, but did not use it and asked Mrs May to change access home quotas in order to fix the “disgraceful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and ending emigration for no justified reason.
He also wants to give the councils more authority to build new homes.
“Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to the return of the British dream, that is, to make life better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is wrong for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies to be able to buy homes in as easy a way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning a home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of the homeless has become too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland.”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his “end-of-life ambition” was to become the head of Scotland’s national club in the future.
The Scottish man, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which is currently third in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer, he moved to St. Mirren's Stadium of Light after returning them to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it,” Ross told the Scottish Sportsound at BBC.
“But I grew up constantly looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father, and there was always something dragging me back.
However, I could only get that opportunity if I was successful in managing the club.”
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager are Dick Advocate, David Moys, Sam Allardiche, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gas Poet, and Paulo Di Kanio.
Former Alloa Athletic chief says he felt no anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names at such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at the moment is assessed with ‘Can I return this club to the Premier League’.
Given the structure and facilities in this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task for this club to get there, but I’ll probably think I’ve made it here only if I bring the club back there.”
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, in which he entered his career after working as an assistant to the chief at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped “Alloa” recover from falling into the third league and returned “St. Mirren” from the edge of losing the title in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in \"Clyde\" \"Hartlepool\" \"Falkirk\" \"St. Mirren\" and \"Hamilton Academical \"
“It was probably a real crossroads to me,” he recalls the takeover of ‘Alloa’.
“I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because it was going well for me, I made enough of it, and I enjoyed certain high benefits.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I’m still going through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good about being a manager.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in this role than ever in my entire adult life.”

According to a study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profit of British pubs currently in a very difficult situation, but has imposed more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA for business consulting services in determining these figures said: “The sun’s time and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the pub’s profits increased by 2.8 percent, and restaurants fell significantly.
The drop in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where drinks are mostly sold saw a much higher increase than previous years than the restaurants where a drop was observed.
The pubs in which mostly food is sold were also badly affected by solar periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
People just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, and the sale of food by just three per cent.
Paul Newman, a holiday and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events remain to be the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the drop in sales of 4.8% over a period of one year will be particularly devastating as a addition to current pressures that generate costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for local owners who were mainly selling food, and time would have shown whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide the much needed rest.

One in five children has a secret profile on social media that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret profile on social media that he hides from his parents and teachers.
Research involving 20,000 high school students has shown an increase in the number of fake Instagram profiles.
The news has raised the fear that sexual content is published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” profile that they show their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create a social media profile that he hides from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Instagram” profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has raised the fear that sexual content is published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they had a purified “main” profile that they showed to their parents, and they also had other private profiles.

A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elid Doyle will be “the voice of the athletes” on the board of “Scottish Athletics”
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most distinguished athlete and President Ian Beatty described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her wide international experience gained over the past decade.
“Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has a huge respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board,” Biti said.
Doyle said: “I am ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help in the proper direction of sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200-400-meter titles at the Atlanta Games in 1996, in addition to winning a total of four gold medals at the Olympic Games and who now regularly appears as a commentator at the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was agonizing, but I was able to fully recover, I could go again and do agility exercises!

Breast pump advertising in which mothers are compared to cows caused a split of opinions on the Internet
A breast pump manufacturing company has caused a split of opinions online when it released an advertisement in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the product, which is said to be “the world’s quietest breast pump,” the user-oriented technology company “Elvie” released a funny advertisement inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled cow stand on a song whose text sounds like this: “Yes, I lick milk, but you don’t look at a tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed this isn’t viminos, these are my breasts.”
He continued: “pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, lick my chest.”
However, the advertisement that was posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it emphasizes the “horribles” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, with the exception of the fact that their children are being stolen from them after just a few days after they are born,” says one of the comments.
Elvie’s breast pump fits discretely into the breastfeeding bra.
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who keep their babies.”
Someone else added: “Really inappropriate advertising”
Others defended the advertisement, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was really “funny”.
“I think this idea is brilliant.
I would buy a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I think it's honest.
“It’s a great product,” one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement intended for mothers who suck milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like “bloods”.
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were soaked in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes, and discretely fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house while they milk.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR at Mother commented: “Elvie’s pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a brave and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who lick milk and dairy cows, we wanted milk to be licked with the help of a pump and the challenges that it brings to the center of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie’s pump has been present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention increased significantly, although border crossings at the monthly level remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to house children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unidentified immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would need to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official last week testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of people arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and most of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That’s why we continue to persecute those individuals,” said Mr Albens.
In order to deal with children more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not within 60 days, as workers in the shelters say the previous standard passed.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to bring their legal status case before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit to receive relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, workers in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months say.
Lawyers say that such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornilo, where due to its size there is a greater likelihood that signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can increase the traumas most of them are already facing.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish \"occupation forces\" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had illegally resided in Syria on the pretext that they were involved in the fight against terrorism and that \"they would be treated appropriately\"
“They must immediately withdraw without conditions,” he told the congregation.
Mualem insisted that \"the war on terrorism is almost over\" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue \"to fight this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories - from both terrorist groups and \"any illegal foreign presence\"
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of the country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accuse “some of the Western countries” of “strengthening irrational fears” that encourage refugees to stay away.
\"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,\" he said.
“They’re politicizing the question that needs to be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with assistance for reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had \"clear deadlines\" and expressed hope that the military action would be aimed at jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters associated with al Qaeda, who would \"be eradicated\"
The UN representative, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition in order to draft a fast-paced constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to \"examination of the members of the current constitution,\" and warned of the consequences of further interference in it.
Why Trump Wins Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win again in the 2020 election unless the impeachment and scandal prematurely terminates his presidential mandate, which is likely to be most of the liberals' hopes.
“The most dramatic finale in the presidency ever seen”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the impact time rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nielsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in impact time, which is 1.7 million more than the four-year period, and The Rachel Maddow Show at MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news was announced.
“This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” Neil Bayer, the lead television producer of the “Designated Survivor” drama at ABC, told a cabinet secretary who became president after Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skowel, a comedy-writing veteran and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
“He replied, ‘Because I think he’s really funny,’” said Mrs. Skowel.
There’s a lot of fun in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
The exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you’ve been looking at a panel of experts who debate the use of a “deep background” source by Bob Woodward for his book “Fear” a skin coat from Paul Manafort’s Noah of $15,000 “a thick arrogance dress,” as he called “The Washington Post”), and the implications of Mr. Trump’s shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump’s anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
“Part of what he’s doing and what gives you a sense of how to watch a reality show is that every night he brings you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and creator of ‘Pawn Stars’ for Trump’s rotating team and day-to-day twists (NFL tariffs, praises for Kim Jong-un).
Don’t miss a single episode because you won’t be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Fleece this week, it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watched \"MSNBC\" while filming on CNN.
He could not stop looking, at least not when Brett Kavano was due to face the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
“I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” said Mr. Fleece.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Inflow of external funds in the narrowest midterm elections in the race for the upper house
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional district in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional areas from which there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is run by Democratic representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another area of the state of emergency elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th congressional area, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps were amended after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were manipulated in favor of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a difficult campaign financing contest between the main party sponsors, the Democratic Party’s Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Party’s National Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the 18th congressional election in Pennsylvania, which was characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade this place was taken by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area with a difference of 20 points.
Political experts give a small advantage to Democrats.
The US has decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China and then quit.
The diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varella and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only with respect to El Salvador were fines taken into account, which received US aid of about $140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and murder rates in it.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar rally last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials have stressed that they want the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any reflection on the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address the mid-October conference as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the rally, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who also talked about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is the release of a report by Special Advisor Robert Miller about a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently very solid evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia in her attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before the voters, and perhaps even before the jury composed of his colleagues.
There are a lot of insecurities here, and I don't want to suggest Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What would we do if Mr. Trump resigned from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein was on the hot chair after the paper announced that he had proposed to secretly film the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for the job he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
“How will we act if Bret Kavano’s new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that would accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fall into all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I don’t think that’s going to happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath table with a swastika logo.

Graham Dorans of \"Rangers\" with an optimistic attitude ahead of the \"Rapid Vienna\" collision
The Rangers hosted a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and they are aware that after the game's draw against Willarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, the victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in the Europa League.
Graham Dorens, the midfielder because of a knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the draw 2-2 game with \"Villarreal\", but he believed that \"Rangers\" could take advantage of that result as a springboard to greater achievements.
\"It was a good point for us because \"Villarreal\" is a good opponent,\" the 31-year-old player said.
“We have entered the game believing that we can achieve something and come back with a winning point.
Maybe we could give a little more at the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
We have another big night on Thursday.
I hope we win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I am sure with the support of the fans we will return and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that happened, that is, my injuries and changes to the club itself, but now there is some positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, leave it behind last season and achieve success.”
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke with their family members about it.
About half of the study participants conducted by Nationwide said they had spoken with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to talk about it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide you with care if you don’t share your wishes with them early.
Work with your advisor and your family and talk about where and how to get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care policy, a life insurance hybrid policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or secure your own insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Take care of your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take out medical care so that you can empower a person of confidence to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think about your financial resources as well.
In this way, we would choose a person of trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications you are taking and its allergies?
Please note these details in writing to be prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.

Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he returned home from his exit.
The victim of about 40 years of age was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST (British Summer Time) as a “accidental act”.
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are urging witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of casualties expected to increase.
Due to the disruption of communications, aid persons cannot receive information from Dongala County, a region north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Below are a few key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a county that stretches more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) on the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia’s disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them being Achech residents.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawa, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake hit Pidi Jaya County in Acheh, causing havoc and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the fallen buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president's candidate Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is at the Matt-Su detention facility with the possibility of leaving if he pays a sum of $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was \"definitely innocent\" when asked how he was brought to court.
Palin faces three A-Class offenses, meaning he may be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a B-Class offense, fined a day in prison and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaskan Veteran Court is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interference with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after saying her son's violent behavior stems from the PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media is circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in New York City terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saippov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a home Depot truck in October to attack the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the announcement of the intention of seeking a death penalty delivered to the South District of New York.
According to court documents, there is an opportunity to impose a death penalty on both grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury has filed charges against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
To carry out the attack, it took \"detail planning and intention,\" the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as \"horrible, cruel and perverse.\"
“Sifulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss of Diego’s family and friends, Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Kleves, Ann-Lore Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlius, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho,” the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death sentence was prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ettel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of plotting to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to put the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he was innocent of all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
\"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and to impose a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defense has previously asked prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Party MP Tory says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised today to \"mobilize the People's Army\" during a protest at the Tory party's conference.
Former party leader Ukip said politicians must \"feel the heat\" from eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's MPs proposing he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn said on a March in Birmingham that the UK would have been \"out of the EU\" by now - if Mr. Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May in terms of the unification of her deeply divided members was highlighted by the counter-Brexit members of the Tory Party, who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the plan from Checkers despite attacks by pro-Brexit individuals, counter-Brexit individuals and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between her package and “haos”.
Mr. Bonn told the pro-Brexit rally \"Leave Means Leave\" in Solihal that he wanted to \"reject the plan from the Checkers\"
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU by now,\" he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we must reject the plan from the Checkers.”
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars so that we would be subjected to it now.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn has rejected the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay in the EU is completely inaccurate.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory party and pro-Brexit was also present on the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The plan from Checkers is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who are due to our victory in the elections.
Please give up the plan from Checkers and start listening to us.
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians must \"feel the heat\" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class,” he said.
\"They're trying to hand over Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we won't let you get away with it.\"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proudly United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit people marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend wearing banners with the inscription \"Tories against Brexit\"
Lord Adonis, a Labour Party member mocked conservatives on security issues faced at the opening of a conference on the party's creation application.
“These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for a border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to think well about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would \"think about running for president\" after the November election.
\"Boston Globe\" announced that the Democratic Party representative from Massachusetts was talking about her future during the city hall in West Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event in Hollywood on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to office, with a city council format in place.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top”.
Suspect arrested for shooting and death of basketball player Sims from LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dieteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wade Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and as a result of it died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wade interfered to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, owned weapons, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and detained in the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
As a 192-cm-high junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 past season appearances, i.e. an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 caps per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is closer to world title after his team secured victory over Sebastian Vetel
Since Saturday, Walter Bottas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's orders will play a major role in the race.
From the pole-position, Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on a strain while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vetel entered the box first and left Hamilton to fight the turmoil at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action one on one that forced Ferrari's driver to reluctantly leave the inside of his free risk of staying aside after the double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the network and ended his 21st birthday at the end of the first round in seventh place.
He then ran for most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and outrun Kimi Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the box in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the other eight rounds, so Raikonen came fourth.
Today is a hard day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman that let me go.
The team made a really extraordinary decision to have their own couple in the race,\" Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blacey Ford accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate’s Justice Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “evil and rude and dishonest”.
“There’s only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and reckless and dishonest,” he said.
“When you see posts and leaks of information, they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you post this information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the document - \"Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t post it.”
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... No, we did not publish it,” he added, mimicking the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein with information about the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford as early as July, but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t post her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked.”
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same at the rally on Saturday: “I’m going to tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but it was the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested Democrats are using allegations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their malice, their malice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they need to trample to regain power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: “Dundee Stars” 5-3-Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in the match against Dundee
Dundee Stars paid for the loss of the Elite League match on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 win in Dundi on Saturday.
\"Giants\" has been given the advantage of two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took advantage of the host before Dwyer returned the lead to Giants.
François Bushard equated Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat of the season within the Elite League for the boys of Adam Kiffy, who fought back with the victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, i.e. at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFall, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bowilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's lead at 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host re-grouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in a late-second match, and he secured the victory of his team in half of the final period of the fifth match.
Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next match on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Flight Controller Died Helping Hundreds of People On Plane Save From Earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people fly safely.
More than 800 people have been killed, and many have been missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong successive earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are stuck in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position at the Muthiara Sis Al-Jufre Airport in Palu, which was constantly being shot down.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air flight number 6321 which was at the time on the runway would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was breaking down.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision had likely saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news broke our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
\"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many cannot even be accessed,\" the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves that have reached six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News, “Quick help carries bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
The mini-markets have been robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
The president of Indonesia, Yoko Vidodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work both day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? – CNN
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline that operated on the plane that fell into the lagoon in the Pacific in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared after saying that the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they could not find the male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details of the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” said Janes.
Janes said he and others were able to cross the water that reached half and head for emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the stewardess were in panic and shouting, and that he suffered a minor injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped rescue them, with the help of an inflatable ship carrying people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the aviation safety network shows that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registration accidents in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst sets a time frame on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended up presenting the case on Saturday for a retrial of a man accused of having been burned alive by a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He said he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data on the location of several mobile phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, \"The Clarion Ledger\" reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was \"lying because my truck was in Nashville.\"
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from her phone.
“He deleted her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
\"The High Breed: What Is A Conscious Hip-Hop?\"
Hip-hop trio wants to refute the negative attitude of this genre by including positive messages in its music.
“The High Breed” from Bristol claims that hip-hop has distanced itself from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and The Common have recently experienced their revival through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York nurse sues couple for being fired after sending “racist” message
A New York nurse sues a married couple for being fired on grounds of discrimination after being mistakenly sent a message from a mother complaining about the fact that she was “another black woman”.
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually a “extortion”.
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when, after the first working day of the new nurse, Giselle Morris, found out she was black.
“NEEEEEEEEEE another black woman,” wrote Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what Plasko-Flaxman did, she felt \"discomfortable\" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, had been doing her job badly and that she had expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and seeking compensation for the $350 layoff per day over a six-month period, an engagement that will involve her living with the family, what she was originally engaged to, but without entering into a deal.
“I want to show them that these things should not be done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the lawsuits that they were racist, saying Mrs. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasko told The Post.
“But would you trust your children to a face you were rude to, even by mistake?”
Your newborn?
Let's be real -
Claiming that the lawsuit was “an extortion” Plasko said that his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was “in a very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?”
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the married couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Pudington publishers fear readers won’t be able to connect to a talking bear, a new letter says.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter who was born shortly after accepting the book, said in a letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of \"Padington\"
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before getting inspired to write a book from a small toy in the form of a bear, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was \"both bitter and sweet\" after his death last year.
For “Padington” whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she adds that her father felt a quiet pride about his potential success.
“He was a really quiet man and he didn’t want to boast at all,” she said.
“But because you felt Padington was so real, it was almost like having a child who had reached something in life: and you are proud of it, even though success is not due to you.
I think Padington's success has seen it this way.
Although it was the creation and fruit of his fantasy, he always attributed the merits to the \"Padington\" itself.
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
“Nad called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected not to survive,” said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
“Then Nad called to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, \"Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications given by doctors to keep her heart pumping was slowly decreasing and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all of her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay calm.
In the end, Mrs. Edenan-Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I bowed my head and the tears stopped.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt an immense compassion for Over.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her.
A sad woman puts cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as an infectious smile.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People have always said that his smile can light up any room.”
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place”.
His brother, then 11, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid it will have a consistent effect.”
Mrs. Davis makes the cards \"to let others know that there are people out there who they can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to start talking.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davis' longtime friend, lost her partner Mark with whom she was married 15 years after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was unhappy or depressed, or he didn’t say anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the day of Christmas when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eye at all and made no contact with them.”
She said his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “This kind of thing is destroying the family.
It remains broken.
But we have to keep going and fight.

Bret Kavano's future is uncertain after FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, that is, a limited-time investigation, with a limited scope, we might be able to achieve a small unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee “is falling apart” in conditions of the rooted Partisan state of no escape.
Why didn't Kavano and his Republican party supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their flexibility is due only to timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on November 6 and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavano, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to change the pending result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has declined under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Bjeong-seug Park, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The majority of North Korean refugees have been granted citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing across China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, which can be easily crossed compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on halting denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal of the Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
But North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday accused the U.S. of stagnation in progress since then.
\"If there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first,\" Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavano \"hysteric\" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader at the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano \"hysteric\" and said that taking his temperament into account, he was inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
\"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman did this, she would say she was \"hysteric,\" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassie Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his introductory exposure, sometimes even shouting and tinkering as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also made clear condemnation by Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him \"a grouting and coordinated destruction of his reputation\" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavano's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he proved to be biased against the Democrats.
“I think she’s disqualifying herself with those statements and the way she’s attacking the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say the following: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not even fit to serve in the court where he is in office at the moment,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible rulings that Kavano will pass against the Law on Accessed Health Care or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavano did not answer questions about whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to go into court and expect us to say, ‘It’s really wonderful, isn’t it?’” Pelosi said.
Women should also use it.
It’s a really sharp criticism, months and years of gathering anger that she can’t get rid of herself without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
\"I don't think that's unusual, do I?\"
She continued, “A woman who performed an executive role helped me a lot, who told me she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she is talking to, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.\"
And then she continues to cry.
I think it’s brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first office jobs where men dominated was when I started crying with inexpressible anger and an older woman, a cold manager from whom I always had a certain fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the ladder.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they’ve been able to touch you.”
Patricia Schröder was a Democratic congressman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
\"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision,\" he told me 30 years later through laughter.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\"
Given the fact that the campaign was launched a long time ago, it did not have enough funding, so it promised not to enter the race if it did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, would only give her $250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During a speech announcing that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions, i.e. gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
“If you had seen me, you would have probably thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schrader remembers how the media reacted to the incident.
“You would have thought that ‘Clinex’ was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my tombstone.

How the trade war between the United States and China can be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the start of the trade war between the United States and China has been stifling, and despite the battle being far from over, the conflict between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long-term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning early this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly this week with the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has always returned to nature, i.e. recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to return the United States to the same extent, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up on it soon.
To get Washington to step down means to accept his demands, but public worship in front of the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, pressures from the US trade war can result in positive support for China in the long-term as it will reduce the interdependentness of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions to start a sharp economic decline in any of the countries is much more dangerous than what was previously established by observers,” said Abigail Grace, an associate for research focusing on Asia at the New American Security Center, which is a think tank.
Syria is \"prepared\" for the return of refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
\"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, due to progress made in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilaterally imposed economic measures that have grown up on their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe has won a significant victory at the Rider Cup in Paris
Europe's team beat the U.S. team in the Raider Cup 2018 with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a European field and has not won the Rider Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its primacy after Danish captain Thomas Björn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, in his first blow from a hole, sent the ball into the water in a pair of three to the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has become one of the four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 from the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Torbjörn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, who may have last played the Rider Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Rider Cups, became the European who won the most tournament titles with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
This year was really hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I am very happy to have the title back.
The team game is the most important and I’m happy to be able to help,” said the emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He now gives way to his compatriot John Ram, who beat one to one on Sunday, Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a score of 2:1.
“I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play,” Ram said.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It is an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking for Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to low-grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furrick, following his team’s disappointing game, said, “I’m proud of these guys, they really fought.
In the morning, we had a hard time with the team in Europe.
We fought.
He's got a hat down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
They've outplayed us.
New information about the red tide: concentrations decrease in Pinelas, Manata and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, conditions of uneven algae bloom are observed in the areas of Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, suggesting a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide, due to the flowering of red algae, stretches about 130 miles on the coast from the northern Pinelas district to the southern Li district.
Red tide parts can also be seen at about 10 miles on the Hillsborough County coast, but the number is still lower than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the district of Pasco.
During the last week, the following concentrations were observed: average concentrations in or on the coast of Pinelas County, low to high concentrations on the Hillsborough County Coast, common to high concentrations in or on the Sarasota County Coast, common to middle concentrations in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations in or on Lee County Coast, as well as low concentrations in Collier County.
In the districts of Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, cases of respiratory irritation continue to occur.
