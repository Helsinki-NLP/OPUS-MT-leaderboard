Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity with “Mapetovci”
Some members of the assembly were harassed by the proposal to change their title to “members of the Welsh Parliament” (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that they might become the object of ridicule.
A Labour member of the congregation said his group was concerned “because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers van Wells: On Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means garbage.
A member of the Plaid political party said the group was \"not satisfied\" in general, and proposed alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was “open” about changing the name, but noted that the small difference between the terms MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of a letter in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Commission currently working on the draft law on the introduction of the name changes stated: “The final decision on the descriptions of the title of members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves,”
The government law of 2017 gave the assembly authority to change the name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in a large support for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to the title of members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly reportedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could give headaches to chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Commission's system plan.
Members of the assembly will have the last chance to vote on their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\"
The popular vote was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbour is a possession of its territory and persistently opposes its EU and NATO membership requirements.
Macedonian President Đorđe Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in the name is a simple price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin are silent as the churches of Harlem fight for survival
“The older people I talked to said that there used to be bars and churches on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
“There is no one else today.”
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People are different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer quarterly daytime residents where people go on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the managers expect, \"and sooner or later, he will return to where they started,\"
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who will not help preserve the remaining quarterly shrines.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the closure of these churches will be accelerated because it is unlikely that people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that served nearby took possession of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's priests made a plan to rebuild, they ordered the organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the organ “the bells of the poor”.
The expert who played the organ in July called them a different: \"cultural treasure\" and \"unreplaceable historical instrument\"
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organ in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to larger organ in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church had not found a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church in the last few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been brought by church chiefs and other episcopal dioceses.
The bishoprical administration – the administrative body of the diocese, composed of church chiefs – wrote to the bishopric in July, expressing concern that the diocese “will seek to convey the costs of the bishop’s administration, although the bishop’s administration was not included in the rental of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishopric.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old during lobster hunting in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday with his friends he dived for about half an hour when he heard a boy calling for help and then drove along with the group to him and helped get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was about excitement for catching lobster, but then \"he realized he was yelling 'She bit me!'
She killed me!”
The whole key bone was torn apart – Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘The shark is in the water!’”
The boy is transported by helicopter to Rady's pediatric hospital where his condition is being treated as critical.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press address that the shark had already been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the area of the upper body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's Beach in Ecinitas for a period of 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains to department cosmetic products in the style of department stores where professional assistants work.
As a result of a significant penetration into the beauty market in the UK worth £2.8 billion, which is on the rise as sales in fashion and home equipment markets fall, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be expanded to more stores next year if they succeed.
There is an investment in cosmetic products because supermarkets find ways to use shelves that were once used for televisions, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its cosmetic range by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brand products will also get more space in departments similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its Boutique make-up line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly looking for younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test out sales at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, and the second will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and moving towards a daily purchase of smaller amounts of food in local stores means supermarkets have to make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of the Sainsbury's chain, said stores would increasingly look like department stores in supermarket efforts to strike back with large-scale Aldi and Lidl discounts, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s opened the department store Argos in hundreds of its stores, and also introduced Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, saying it increased the sale of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has ended infamously.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended with a dispute over the share of pharmacies in their stores.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds has been said to play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury’s chain, said: “We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and an attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an indispensable destination for the beauty market that sets new standards compared to the old way of buying –
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is “angry” after television host Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal with his 11 million-pound personal brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and accessories Truly.
The company of this pair is compared to the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand.
This Morning (37) announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has enraged Dragons' Dan Peter Jones star by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was \"angry\" when a gold girl admitted to television during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant there was no more time to devote their brand of home and accessories to True.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop, and it was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) posted her departure on Instagram, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his cottages.
The source said: “Holly put Truly at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would secure her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to step down stunned everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a lot of products ready to sell at the Marlow headquarters.
Experts believe that the departure of the head of the This Morning show, which is among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as the company's director.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become M&S's ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin as the ITV host for I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We wouldn’t comment on his business.”
Hard words, “And then we fell in love”
He joked about criticism he could get from the media over comments that could be described as “unpresidential” and a positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said in his funny voice, “The reader of the news.”
“I didn’t give up at all.”
Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an “adequate response” from the United States to North Korea’s initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have great relationships now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - by suspending missile tests, freeing hostages and returning the remains of U.S. troops.
And he stood up for his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s easy to act presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok is displaced, the state of national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult,” said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team that will travel to Pal, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Pal to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the assistance.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is sad how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently there was no siren for the tsunami on the island of Pal, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship docked in Lombok to provide assistance to the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia’s depleted infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has hit Mr. Joko's administration while expecting new elections next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the street struggles of Christian and Muslim groups, who used swordsmen, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, a footballer of Liverpool, scored a deep-seated goal against Chelsea football club.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to the Premier League by hitting the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri on about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal club while his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left and then kicked it to the outside.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, turning to the upper right corner of the grid.
Eventually she fell over Kep Arrizabalg who was in the jump and fell into the net.
“It was only up to positioning, until receiving the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanta coming, I touched her once, and I didn’t think much, I just hit the ball.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue striker added the ball to Mate Kovačić in the fifth attack before running from the middle of the field into Liverpool's half.
Kovačić quickly touched and returned the ball in the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful cross, citing Khazard into a criminal space.
Hazard was faster than the defense and ended up near the posture by inserting into the net with his left foot past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli at the group stage of the Champions League in three hours on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the Europa League on Thursday.
Indonesia's tsunami's death toll reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people were reported buried in the ruins of buildings that crashed an earthquake of 7.5 which occurred on Friday and raised waves of up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with the remains of the destroyed buildings.
Police Arrest Man (32) After Woman Was Killed
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in the Merseyside area this morning.
A 40-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people who had seen or heard something coming.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I invite everyone near John Street Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded some cameras on the car control plates, to contact us as they may have information that is important for the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found from Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived at the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He ran out of text when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to go back inside.
They heard a police officer tell one man that the whole zone was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene of a tearful crime.
She said, \"This is so terrible.\"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van next door.
A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon monitoring the apartment building.
All who have any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 citing the 247 case from 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament has become the latest monument in the midst of a “revision of history” argument.
Its removal would be poetic justice because of the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England, carried out by his Puritan followers in the manner of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's proposal as \"the madness\" and \"the attempt to review history\"
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the context of the current debate on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Palace in Westminster would become a target.
Cromwell did not order or conduct iconocracy during the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his predecessor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of the character that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many to be, perhaps, at the end of the nineteenth century rather than today, a protector of parliament from external pressures, in his case of the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely true is the subject of a lasting historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell was a recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of glory and remembrance.
The killer pig inflicted death injuries on a Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man who is known to have been named Yuan was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pig market in the city of Lipanshui in the Guizhou area, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was prepared to inject pigs into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
Apparently, he arrived with a cousin from the Yunnan district on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood around her mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 libri had inflicted fatal injuries on a farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and dismembered,” said the cousin, who introduced himself to the name Wu, according to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera record shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent an attack on other people while police were collecting evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are reportedly negotiating damages for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
The pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-grained pig brought a Welsh farmer along with his tractor until his wife frightened her and drove her away.
After the pigs ate the Oregon farmer in 2012, a manitobe farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
“They’re just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has weakened as it moves above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods due to showers across northern Mexico and the United States in the next few days.
Rosa's first-class hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles per hour of five o'clock a.m. on Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gap in the Pacific Ocean is forming and moving eastwards and west coasts of the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture along with the upcoming gap will create widespread rainfalls in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, rainfalls and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in rainfall that will instantly reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of the sudden deterioration of weather conditions and the typical spread of tropical rain.
Walking on foot in the desert would be extremely thoughtless with the danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains in canyons could result in wild rivers, and thunderstorms with local strong winds and sandstorms.
The upcoming gap will bring local showers to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation of over half an inch is possible, which could cause application and slippery Augusts.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue all Wednesday.
In October, there may be large fluctuations in temperature throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remains of summer heat will try to accumulate and expand again.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announced a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s exciting testimony in court Thursday, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly happened in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political repugnant continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasts over the latest plot on Friday: a deal that Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that he was 100 percent sure that he had touched Kavanaugh and tried to break up at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company has computerised viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network channels.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties listing people who monitor transmission from the office.
To make it better, it’s an audience similar to one that follows the football elimination matches or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led ahead of other networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protesters shouting at him after trying to get into the elevator to attend a hearing of the judicial commission.
He stood down for a few minutes while he was offended, with live transmission on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the earth?
He was told, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, he had more to say at the commission hearing.
Cable and television networks had a live broadcast hours later as the judicial commission voted whether to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigates the charges against a named next week, which is what a minority of Democrats are calling for.
Flake was partially persuaded by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"playing politics\" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of \"playing politics\" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times daily.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a second interview with her on the cover of the journal, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying the proposal for the UK and the EU to take tariffs on each other is “absurd”.
The murder of Wade Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspect in LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of a dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Simpson had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took glasses from the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB network's CBS channel.
After the Simpson investigation, the police said he confessed to killing Wade.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East District M.E., Baton Rouge, issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a shot from a gun to the head and neck.
The department said the credits belong to the Louisiana Refugee Police Task Force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the residents of the area who helped in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement agency for “the diligence and aspiration for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
A 6-foot-high and 6-inch striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said the team was \"desperate\" and \"in shock\" because of Wade's death.
“This is what we worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano tosses ash in Mexico City
The ash flashing volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Protection Center warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased after 183 gas and ash emissions were registered at 24 hours.
The center followed several earthquakes and rumblings.
The images on social media show a thin layer of ash that covers car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increased activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protesters, independence supporters, clashed with a special police force, when thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to mark the anniversary of a polarizing Catalan secession referendum.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special squad of police, shot them with eggs and powder paints, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, riots broke out with police who used pendrekes to stop the fight.
Independence supporters chanted for several hours, “No forgetfulness, no forgiveness,” and clashed with supporters of the union who shouted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people received a medical treatment for minor injuries they suffered in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions are still high in a region that has been committed to independence a year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters largely chose independence, although turnout was low as opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in violent clashes across polling stations across the region.
Groups advocating independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and give support to national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they changed the route.
Narcissist Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we’re in a rush,” he said.
Although they took a key but tight victory in the local elections last December, Catalan independence parties had difficulty holding momentum because some of their most famous leaders were in self-imposed exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a police-backed protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
\"It's getting tense,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament next year.
\"The bid in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities,\" he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crash
Three men (33, 34, and 39) were arrested after being hit by a car multiple times in a Londonderry house.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday around 19:30 a.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There is a possibility that at some point a car was shot from a crossbow.
Menge hit Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menge's first goal secured victory for Livingston
The improved Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only a second loss for Steven Gerard in 18 Ibrox matches.
The Dolly Menge goal was key, while Gary Holt's club was equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's club has not won any Premier League guests this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts behind which eight points fall behind next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna in a European League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of league victories to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Missed Opportunities Against Guests
The Holt team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt went past the goal, then Alan Lithgrove's attempt went past the goal after he slipped in to receive the ball Craig Hallkettt had head-on to the goal.
The hosts were asked to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for free-strike guests.
And that is how a key goal was scored.
A free kick against the Rangers was given, Livingston made a pass, and Nolan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who received the ball and hit it from the middle of the criminal space.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but the host's defense remained impenetrable and Liam Kelly's goalkeeper had little trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman's feet were stopped by goalkeepers Allan McGregor, and Litthgow shot too wide from another free kick for Livingston.
The Crosses were constantly arriving at Livingston's penitentiary and were constantly defended, while the two penals they were looking for - one after the foul against the substitute player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the hand game - were not awarded.
Phenomenal game – Livingston – analysis
BBC journalist Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni Arena
A fantastic game and a result of Livingston.
They were all great to one and continue to exceed expectations on the ascending path.
Their style of play and players have almost not changed since their return to the top, but great merits belong to the Holt that gives it energy to the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga throughout the match gave peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were from time to time under Gerard's bat, they didn't reach that level.
The final blows were missing – they only broke through the ranks of the hosts once – and this is a kind of wake-up call for Rangers in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of smiles and blue skies as leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair NATO's relations.
They diverged on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks living outside Turkey lives.
Police have cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan – many of them Kurds – were also vocal, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect the division in the opinions of a guest that some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others resent him for being an autocrat.
Deptford: Bicyclist killed in car crash
The cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 a.m. in British weather.
The car driver stopped and intervened an ambulance team, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after another cyclist was killed in a crash in which the driver left the crash site, on Childers Street, about a mile away from the scene of Saturday's accident.
London police said they were working to identify the victim and inform the family.
The streets are closed, buses are diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in high-security riots for men, the prison office said.
The riots broke out in the Long Lartin prison in the Worcestershire area on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. in British weather and are still ongoing.
A special task force of tornadoes has been called on to calm the riots involving eight protégés in one wing of prison.
The officers suffered minor injuries to their faces and were given assistance on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison administration said: “We have deployed specially trained prison personnel who are engaged in an incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received medical attention for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that they will be transferred to the police and that their prison sentences could be extended.
Long Lartin prison has housed more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special unit was called to prison for serious riots in which personnel were attacked by billiards' balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be of benefit in drought affected areas)
Rarely when tropical depression hits Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa passes through its remaining energy through desert southwestern areas, carrying with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Administration has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will announce a rainfall on Monday night.
The National Weather Administration in Phoenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!”
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other regions of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin, it will most likely be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no fear of flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought control agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit at least by extreme drought, the second highest category,” said Weather.com.
First, on its way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a landslide on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have hurricane power on Sunday morning with 85 miles per hour winds, will be 385 miles south of Punt Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and will begin to soar.
Mexico is expected to hit by a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The showers in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a high risk of flooding.
“The total precipitation of three to six inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and maybe even up to 10 inches,” reports Weather.com.
Rosa will then head north over Mexico by force of a tropical storm before reaching Arizona early in the morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday late evening.
“The main danger expected of Rose or its lags is the large rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the American Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rainfalls are expected to cause lush floods dangerous to life and apply in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4am in British weather.
He was taken to the hospital and in “stable” condition.
The 17-year-old, two eighteen-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials are urging those who have any recordings of the event by mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered subordination and anger – democratic party”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered subordination and anger – the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasey Ford’s claims that he had been sexually assaulted a few decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw shine, quality and courage – Kavanaugh that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most created legal minds of our age, a lawyer with great public service achievements,” a group of supporters in West Virginia said.
The president directly touched on Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I’m not running for office, I’m actually running,” he said.
\"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates all over the place.\"
Trump says Democrats are trying to “offer resistance and interfere”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican party official told CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase.
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Pal on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) hit the coast at dusk, bringing many to death and destroying everything they found their way.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the danger of tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, and they got hurt,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster resolution agency in Jakarta.
“Cunami did not come alone, he carried cars, balvans, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Pal.
Photos from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a host of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and demolished bridges and a water-stricken mosque.
The earthquakes continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of the massive earthquake was 200 times higher on Friday than the power of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city located on the edge of the long, narrow bay increased the power of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as “major” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, sales centers and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications \"were completely cut off without any information,\" Donggala said.
“More than 300,000 people live here,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to vulnerable areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse,” they said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report that the tsunami had hit Pal, although officials said the waves had arrived at a time when the warning was issued.
Amateur records shared on social media show a man on the upper floor who warns people on the street below of the upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the wall of water struck the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palua, making it difficult for the authorities to rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport is only reopened for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palou on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has risen above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision staff must have arrived from Donggala in Pal, where employees were placed in tents erected in the yard of the office, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Mr Dosseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take the first steps to alleviate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is possible only if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster on the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘all right, this is a national disaster’, we will be open to international aid, but that status has not yet been declared.”
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami falls on the Pale on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their shocking story in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was buried under the ruins next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the circles of the paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palou who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves reportedly stole $26,750 from a Brinco worker who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
The car driver emptyed the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “run behind Brinke’s employee” and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, according to a statement, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper changes name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Posting a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “It will be previously known as Kanye West”.
West (41) has been known for some time as Ye and has used the name for the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where his new album Yandhi is expected to be promoted.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s author said.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
“I believe that ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It originated from Kanya, meaning the only, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are.
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, Jay-Z, also used versions with or without lines and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico has sworn not to use an army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that “he will never use an army to conquer the Mexican people”.
The army fired at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education were pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double artificial intelligence funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in the field, said the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. authorities issued announcements on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally lacked an official artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A double artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances of a further major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” released by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, was the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that proved superior to the top-ranked U.S. Othello player, and was later CEO at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged earlier technology competitions by the U.S. government such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when the next competitions could be planned to identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to make enormous efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s what corporations do,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired great individuals from the university to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States solidify its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think we should automatically offer green cards to PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense formed a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to involve partners in industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Election Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to form the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\" a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims their northern neighbor's name is a claim to its territory and vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue this could compromise the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Đorđe Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether a minimum of 50 percent would come to the referendum, which is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot read: \"Are you for membership in NATO and the EU while accepting an agreement with Greece?\"
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would be guided by the result of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required to change the name.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when a total of 66 per cent of voters went to the polls.
“I came to vote for my children, it’s our place in Europe,” said Djose Tanevsky, 62, a voter in Skopje’s capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a Macedonian name change referendum, which could pave their way for NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and drew chairs in front of the tents that were crucified by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor but proud country.
If they don’t want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia whose unemployment rate is higher than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote ‘for’ because more than 80% of our population is for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the ticket was inserted.
He said the result would be a \"confirmation of our future\"
A poll released Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – below the required turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would vote “for”
In order for a referendum to be successful, a 50 percent turnout plus one vote is needed.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the full defense of Brighton and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling got rid of Brighton's defense in a 2-0 Manchester City victory against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was very easy when Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defenders of Brighton before he was on the open ground.
Aguera was then surrounded by three green shirts.
He pushed around one defensive player and was faster than a few more on the edge of Brighton goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English striker took advantage of his first blow in the criminal space to return the ball to Aguera, who overcame the goalkeeper Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right side of the network.
“Aguero had some problems with his feet,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what it was.
We're lucky he scored the goal at that moment--
But Sterling was the one who gave the sky blues the initial advantage of the Premier League.
He scored the goal in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton's field.
He beautifully added Leroy Sane to his left flank.
Sane touched several times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The sky-blue attacker threw the ball into the net before it slipped off the field.
The city is fighting Hoffenheim at the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game with no competitive significance against Rockys
Since Nationals was eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another game.
But rival Scherzer hopes to take office on Sunday against Colorado Rockys, but only if the Rockys, who have a match over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still outplaying.
At least they have a direct pass for a 5:2 win against the Nationals on Friday, but they are still trying to win their first league title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, at least we can get out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams is likely to be at the highest level compared to all the other years.
Why I don’t want to compete in these conditions –
Nationals are still due to announce the start-up team for Sunday, but they are reportedly willing to let Scherzer throw into the situation.
Scherzer, to whom it would be the 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will throw on Sunday when he usually rests.
D.C. right-handed mended 18:7 this season for an average of 2.53, 300 Stakaut wounds in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation over the election of his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important choices of our lives.
These are some of the big, big -- even though I didn't run for office, I'm actually a candidate because I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere,\" he said.
Trump continued, “You see these terrible, terrible groups of radical Democrats, this is happening right now.
And they are determined to restore power using all possible ways, see malice, dirty games.
They don't care about who they're going to hurt, who they're going to run over in order to get power and control, power and control are what they want, and we won't give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of “resistance and distraction”.
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, evil, evil and dishonest.”
He cited a Democratic senator and a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Dianne Feinstein, with a name that prompted the audience to make a loud disdain.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting - it was really a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen -
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
They are intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party branch voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour members to be told they are not welcome and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreements with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notification from the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East on Friday reads \"we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive\"
During the eight years I spent as a local Labour member of parliament, Friday night meetings were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the same and the promise “more kind, more tender – politics has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I believed shared similar political views began to expect me to make a 180-degree turnaround and take positions I would otherwise never agree with, whether it be national security or the European Union's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – it’s accompanied by a torrent of insults on social networks, calls for removal from the party, condemnation of the center’s policy, and they tell me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with the flow of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not retreat.
The most disappointing thing about this political age is how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different attitudes and with every voice of mistrust or change of the rules of selection of the party narrows down.
I got a lot of advice and for the last two years, they've been trying to get me to bow my head, be less vocal, and then \"I'll be okay.\"
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Prime Minister Thatcher’s government, which literally left my primary school classroom collapsed, I have sought to advocate for better public services to those most in need, whether as a local councilman or minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, including my last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say that when the country comes to Brexit that will endanger households, jobs and our public services, I don't understand why someone would waste their time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the main message that I have is not addressed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that threats by removing me from the party or political mirage will not prevent me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr won a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of the Tennent's Premier League day.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undefeated of the ten teams.
In the end, the domestic team won the victory thanks to superior defense, as well as a number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robbie Christie of Melrose said, “Ayru, good luck, they took their chances better than us.”
Grant Naderson's 14th-minute attempt to turn Frazier Climo gave him the advantage of Ayra, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, whom the Warriors had let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage, and Jason Baggott captured an unconverted attempt.
The Climo penaloma increased Ayr's leadership before, just before halftime, he achieved a solo attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose began the second half well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knotto, who was carried out on the stretchers, and below Ayr increased his advantage by trying to transform the Climo by Stafford McDowall.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the numerical superiority with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned and when Struanhutchinson got a yellow card because of the foul over the climate without a ball. MacPherson reached touch down from the penal line behind the upcoming Ayra mall.
Climo turned it, as he had done almost since the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's blow into a penitentiary and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt at the host.
Star of the Still game is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in a popular BBC series he writes for and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although a source of the journal Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in a “growing restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours: Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean.
Sailors patrol a sea headquarters in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags in public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued with the slogan: “We have a right to sea.
Returning to the sea is our duty.
All over the mainland Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast they have lost in favor of Chile in a bloody breach around natural resources in the nineteenth century – as well as the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, while Bolivia expects the verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of counseling.
“Bolivia has captured the momentum, in the spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the verdict of the international court of justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia and claim that – after decades of convulsive negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin, who is about to fight for re-election next year, also plays a big role when it comes to Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is pronounced only six months after the last arguments have been heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have taken him back.
“The problem of the exit to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zarate said.
Morales's wartime rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivian representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring a “extreme opportunity for Bolivia to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “put a point of 139 years of disagreement on mutual satisfaction,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the issue of exit to the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to exit the Pacific,” he added.
“A judgment is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not lift nuclear weapons until they trusted Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between the conflicting leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the border to restart nuclear negotiations more than three months after Singapore and meet Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that the continuation of sanctions and opposition from the United States will ever end the Korean War to put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree to the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, the government of universal skepticism when it comes to the seriousness of Pyongyang regarding the denial of the nuclear arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit of Kim and Trump.
In Paris fashion shows presented the latest line of huge hats that you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely hide the sun, you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of wacky giant hats on the runways of their spring and summer 2019 magazines, overshadowing everything on the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have won Instagram this summer, and these designers have shown their impressive creations on the fashion runways.
Valentine's most prominent piece was an over-emphasized hat with a wide feathered perimeter that swallowed the heads of the model.
Among other bulky additions, watermelons with decorative stone, wizard's hat, and even pineapple, have been found, but their purpose is not to keep your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks on time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips found and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a breather and a mask, and the other resembled a cornette with melted ice cream.
And if you’re among those who follow the trend of attracting attention – you’re lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
Huge hats came after La Bombe – a straw hat with a two-foot perimeter that was seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which designed this very impractical hat that flooded social networks, sent on the runway another big creation – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model that wore it.
The Zasitonarange Rhafia Bag with Resins and White Leather Lunch was a prominent detail of the Jacques La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of the famous Luke Armitage told FYROM: “I expect that big beach hats and bags will arrive at the shops in time for the next summer, since the designer has made such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-named fashion accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding exam results, which is further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seeks to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and more education, a chosen career and a place in the society of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject of students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that understands it, it pleases him.
If you speak to him in his own language, it pleases his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of the exam this year, we see that the languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a grade A in the high school finals.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A from Mandarin in high school finals, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish, also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will no doubt be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as elective subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, mechanical engineering and mathematics) and in independent schools programs, and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that in 17 percent of the reasons why employers cited difficulties filling jobs are precisely the lack of those who know foreign languages.
So, knowledge of foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary in order for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs that require knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is necessary in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they know another language, they will have a true advantage in the future because it is a skill for a lifetime.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically place a person who speaks more languages in front of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by more than 4,000 Britons in 2013, 75% did not speak a second language well enough to have a conversation, while France was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
This is why investing in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to languages that are taught.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests are, you will always find several languages from which you will be able to choose in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing learning environments that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary to succeed, whatever awaits them in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are of key importance to the future of the country, so this must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered \"international communication skills\"
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien just faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said he would play James in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still don't know how many minutes he's going to play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about plans in six games during the Lakers preseason.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings in the coming week, including visits to friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his vote to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
When is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven o'clock tonight in Eastern Time, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trump set in West Virginia under live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearings this week regarding Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court, which has been strained by allegations of sexual harassment, and the Senate's expected vote has been postponed for seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans achieve better results in the November elections.
President Trump’s campaign said the rallies are being held this week to “give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman who refused to present himself told Reuters.
Scheduled at Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight’s rally could gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw attention to the media from Pittsburgh – according to a report by West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time this month that Trump will visit West Virginia, a country where he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, who doesn't stand well in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president came to try to raise his rating in polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Struggle to Keep Hope Before Individual Matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, four on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing of the pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sport, but one of the ones that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who do they think has momentum right now?
“They ran six points, and now four, so it can be said that the swing is on our side,” Jordan Spieth said on his departure.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points more, with another twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there is much that gives them encouragement, among other forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each has taken three points out of the possible four.
Spieth was great from the first to the last punch and leads by his example.
The exclamations of the celebrations were getting louder during his round, in order to eventually play a key blow for an unresolved score in the fourth match when he and Thomas fell behind two after two.
His final hit with a match with 15 holes was met with a similar exclamation, one that reflects the faith that there is hope for the American team.
“You just have to do your best to take care of your match,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with multiple points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but irresistible European couple won all four matches and a no-mistake game.
“Molliwood was the only couple who did not hit God on Saturday afternoon, and they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game, which has been shown so far and the way they exchange energy with noisy audiences, has solidified them in the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take the potential European victory as the sun sets over the fields of the Le Golf National Club.
It would be best for both at the same time on different holes.
It’s too early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero that morning, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
One god shot and two doubles in the first nine holes buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole from which they could not even spring to the end.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-ball game is so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips they give and which they don’t give, and the way strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a big advantage over the final day, but this four-day session has also shown that the U.S. team has a desire for a fight that some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 ahead of last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's games with four balls and fours it has gained an advantage of 10:6 over the United States.
Inspired by the couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the first to win two victories over the moody Tiger Woods, increasing the score so far in the Le Golf National field to four points.
Europeans Thomas Byron in a fight to regain the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise Americans in a four-ball morning game and won a 3-1 series.
The United States provided greater resistance to the four tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the lag.
Jim Furyk must win eight points in 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debuter to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari were named \"Molliwood\" after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they did a great job of composing tired Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who made it through two games on Saturday, flashed at moments, but now lost 19 out of 29 games in a four-ball game and four and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during a four-ball morning game, returned to his partner Henry Stanson in the four tournament and suffered a 2:1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
Europe did not all go according to the plan of this pleasant bright day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner of the main Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas tournament set a two-point goal for Americans on Saturday.
They won a 2:1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, to return later and beat Paulter and Rory McIllroy 4:3 in four, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has some team returned after a four-point delay in front of individual matches, although the Furyk side defending the title is enough to hold the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, it seems that they could not carry out the counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says there is “no talk” about unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that extending sanctions deepens its mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said North Korea has taken \"significant measures over the past year to demonstrate goodwill - such as nuclear and missile tests, nuclear ground dismantling, and promises not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“There is no response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no mention of the first unilateral disarmament.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's resistance to a \"step-by-step\" approach to denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, the significance of his statement was that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri called for a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with a security guarantee.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States says Pyongyang must first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also responded to calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States does not give up ‘denuclearization first of all’ and increases the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposed to ‘proclaiming the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can throw us on our knees is to let the dreams of people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If we were to negotiate this problem with South Korea, not with the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come to such an unexited position.”
However, Rio's tone of speech differed dramatically from last year's speech, when he said at the UN General Assembly that shooting US land with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after \"Mr. Evil President\" Trump called Kim a \"rocketer\" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much more needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea carries out denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, “If necessary, let it last for two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council sanctions must remain strictly and without ceasing to be implemented until complete, final, confirmed denuclearization takes place.”
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006, in an effort to prevent funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with the words that progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him after just a few hours for making “gangster demands”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “proper measures”.
He told him Kim told him that “resisting measures” that require the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to more sleep in an effort to eradicate an increasingly popular macho culture of learning “all night long with the help of caffeine”.
One academic noted that students of the world’s leading university are often ignorant of basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created a course he believes is the only one of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to start this course was given after a speech he gave about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
In the end, a girl came to me and said, “Why are you only telling me this right now, in my absolute year?”
She said that no one ever told her how important the dream was – which surprised me – she told The Telegraph.
This year’s course presents the basics for students on how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports results, as well as improving their general condition.
Paul Barreira, a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was noted that students suffered from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, the picture of the room in the dorm and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of the routine before bedtime.
In the other part, participants were told that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the student’s behavior at the moment.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects it has on smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride because of the “awakened night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a lack of sleep becoming an increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and a high-quality one, should be a “secret weapon” – students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess weight, since due to lack of sleep the brain passes into a fasting regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate for his entire campus-level maintenance.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to pass a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting alarms on time to sleep and wake up, and take care of the harmful effects of blue light, which emit electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeats Gerrard team
The Rangers experienced another depressing loss in the guests when Dolly Menga shot down Steven Gerard's dissatisfied team to a 1:0 defeat from Livingston.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first win in the guests after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerrard in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the uninspired Rangers line-up never came even close to leveling.
While the Rangers now fell sixth, Livingston climbed third and behind Hibernian only because of the goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the line judge Calum Spence had to show help when he was being shot by an object on the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Ayr and placed in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was awarded the same eleven Livingston players who took a point last week to Hearts and would be delighted with the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
Little was missing to score only two minutes after Menga first added to empty space Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed a big chance and kicked next to the goal.
The deep free kick of Keaghan Jacobs was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defending Alan Lithgow just managed to kick past the goal, end of the tripod.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have gotten a penal in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombians' request.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but the former goalkeeper of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, defended Lassana Coulibaly's head without any problems and tamed the shot directed by Ovie Ayaria.
Although the first goal of Livingston in the 34th minute may not have reflected the real power ratio in the course of the game, no one can dispute that it was deserved, if for nothing else, then because of the effort invested.
The Rangers again could not cope with Jacobs' deep free kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when he added the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard responded to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately resulted when the wing player hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to get guests to play just as it suits them, with long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor held well and defended Jacobs's attack so that Lithgow would send the ball to the goal from the corner of his head.
The substitute player of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, sought another penalty at the end of the game when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not react again.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
And now, the station from our “Sunday Morning” almanac: September 30, 1882, on today’s day 136 years ago... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually become a device known as a Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main strongholds of science, Geiger's counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Bell of Coronada, starring seemingly amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is it?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: \"Yes, it's a shoot-up.\"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of therapy.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory
They can thus “see” a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-injected
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the ovaries of the woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves the removal of immune cells from the patient, the reuptake of them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein and re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Malignant Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2-supports the growth of several cancers – including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and “learning” the same as how to target malignant cells was effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a strong speech of support to Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance on SNL.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was scouted in a studio during Saturday Night Live show after a show praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that evening, he wore a cap with the inscription “Make America Great” insulting Democrats and again talking about his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked to white people so many times that they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?
If I didn’t care about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began a sketch show starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission on allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, a recording of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to make fun of West by uploading the tape.
West also complained to the public that he found it difficult behind the scenes because of the hat.
“They teased me behind the scenes.
They said, \"Don't go out with that hat on your head.\"
They teased me!
And then they say to me that I collapsed,” he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see what it looks like?” adding that “Superman’s cloak will be dressed because it means you can’t command me. You want the world to progress?
Try Love
His comments prompted the audience to whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL show were visually embarrassed, Varianty said, while one person who was present said: “The whole studio has completely quieted down.”
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by performing a song I love it disguised as a bottle of Perriere.
Westa was supported by TPUSA’s conservative group leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted, “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not stepping down in front of the abusers.”
But Karen Hunt tweeted that West was simply “what he truly is and that it is absolutely beautiful”.
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe he has embraced and spread an ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
“We did,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now “it will be previously known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the “artist previously known as Prince”.
Charge of attempted murder after a person was stabbed at a restaurant in Belfast
A 40-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington condemns toxic macho culture
Keith Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who beat the sword in a violent medieval fantasy, the HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor (31) has come up with a macho hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys often think they need to be rough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture in the #MeToo era.
A whale who recently married a partner from the Game of Thrones, Leslie Rose (31), admitted that he had a “strong need” to address this problem.
“I’m personally currently quite troubled by the question – what we’ve been wrong about presenting masculinity,” he said.
“What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading toxic macho culture because of the depiction of characters who present themselves as men.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is inducing?
What is it they teach us on TV and on the streets why do young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of behavior of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the main questions of our age – how do we change that?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the boys--
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the presets or sequels of the Game of Thrones series after its end next summer, saying that he \"completed with battlefields and horses\"
As of November, Keith will star in the play by Sam Shepherd True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that had happened in the Game of Thrones series.
“In this series, I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, a love partner of Keith's character Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won the Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which is a change from the previous state of affairs.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual relations is a pressing problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative understandings in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus often occurs due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff had released information about Republican senators, condemning “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”.
U.S. MP Maxine Waters has denied any of her staff has released personal data from three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia’s website.
A Democratic MEP from Los Angeles says the claims are being posted by experts and the “ultra-right wing” website.
“Leaders, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a Twitter post.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a hearing by the Senate committee on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications is linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of its staff, Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie,” she continued.
“My staff member – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims – is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This baseless statement is a completely false and absolute lie.
Waters' statement soon sparked a conviction on the Internet, also made by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial exhales anger,” Fleicher wrote.
“This concludes that she does not have the temperament required for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't be angry.
He can't be impertinent.
He can't question the defendant's motives.
They must be calm and calm.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the critics of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of acting too furiously at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to remove Waters in midterm elections, also tweeted.
“The big thing if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned “the appropriate competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims”.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, “and that they are accountable before the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English's Review Again in Action - A Soft Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext on Brexit in every new film with British themes, which can also be applied to this continuation of the satirical action comedy franchise on Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of “Johnny English” and returned to the screens in 2011 with the continuation of “Johnny English: Reborn”.
Will irony autosatize how obviously useless we are be the new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, the obnoxious, incompetent Johnny English rubber face got a new opportunity to blow something up – with his name telling more than anything that it was a general comical creation designed for territories with a cinema audience whose English is not the native language.
It is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite the bizarre claims to the highest glamor, carries little Clouseau, a crumb of Mr. Bean and a crumb of that guy who played only one note in the theme tune of the “Chariots of Fire” event at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
It is also originally based on a traveler and an international man wrapped in a veil of secrets that Atkinson once starred in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval knightly armor and when the rotor knives briefly clapping about his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way superfluous, especially now that “serious” film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission confidently add comic elements.
The impression is that it is about humor for children, not for adults, and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's gogs in the style of silent films in the image of Mr. Bean.
Now it is a very topical topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
Hacker infiltrated a British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the terror of an agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop in a full glass of water for a prime minister, a pomp and beaten-up character who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to a decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson has played this character maestro as a role model for Theresa May, but the script is rather scarce.
Her intelligence consultants have informed that all active spies are compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the cocky Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a classy institution, but unofficially gives lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gigs when English holds an academy for spying in the manner of the film “School of the Rock”.
English is quickly returned to Bethlehem for emergency instructions and reassembled with former immeasurably patient partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bowe is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and noisy role Vicky Pepperdine is little spent.
So Batman and Robin are back at Her Majesty's secret service and fortunately the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelia Bullett, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the villainous Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of comical events: disguised as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, making a mess of hiding on Voltina's luxury yacht, and English launches a real anarchy trying to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house using headsets for virtual reality.
It is obvious that the great effort has been invested in this last sequence, but no matter how sweet and cheerful, the entire film seems to have been made for children.
It's quite a central quality.
As with other films about Johnny English, I can’t help wondering: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan in which the British would work four days a week but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to transfer time to workers who save thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by giving them another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea \"would fit\" into the party's economic agenda and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: “The new policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits into a party approach to economic rebalancing for workers, as well as a party industrial strategy in general.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.”
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour Party conference last week to expose his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of “unspoiled directors” and “profiter” in utility companies.
The plans of the opposition chancellor also mean that current owners of shares in water supply companies may not recover their total investments because Labour could impose “rejections” based on perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in the board of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10 percent of the value of private sector companies to employees who seem to collect annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy Talks About “60 Minutes” – Could The FBI Investigators Change Their Mind?
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's investigation could get some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, show correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I think, of course,” said Kennedy.
“Before the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, I asked, \"Did you do it?\"
He was unshakable, determined, unambiguous.
Senator Graham's voice, however, appears to have been decapitated.
“My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh was formed and a strong accusation would be needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And anyone she appoints can’t confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.
What is the Festival of Citizens of the World and did it do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the host city of the Festival of World Citizens, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of Citizens of the World will gather tens of thousands of people on the large lawn of Central Park who will not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The citizens of the world festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group that advocates the abolition of poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight against it.
To get a free event ticket (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, sending emails to the world’s leader, telephone calls, and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the citizen of the world with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another kind of so-called “cliktivism” – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the citizens of the world have said they have recorded more than 19 million “actions” of their supporters who have advocated for a range of different goals.
They say these actions have led world leaders to announce promises and policy directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 promises and announcements resulting from their actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and realists from the UK who promised to “help children grow to their full potential” by promising that Rwanda would allocate $35 million to care about the end of malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historical footnote,” said UK Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman, who visited live concerts in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the Food Power Project, whose interventions would touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, which reads “why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
The citizen of the world answers: “It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall down and fall down.
However, like all major civil rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Navy Could Block Russia in Energy Export – Home Affairs Secretary
Washington can “if necessary” use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, Ryan Zinkke, the U.S. Secretary of State of the Interior, said in a statement.
Zinkke claims that Russian engagement in Syria – namely, they are there at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe and the center of Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
“The United States has the opportunity to ensure, together with our navy, that the sea corridors remain open or block them if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at an event which was organized by the Energy Consumers' Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself \"the voice of energy consumers\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, saying it was the same thing.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less about fuel use and replacement,” he said, saying that Russia owns only one card, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration's mission to increase exports of ingested natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a far more favorable option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that would, according to Trump, make Berlin a “conqueror” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which needs to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s reasons for fierce opposition are purely economic in nature and that this is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of applying pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers,” Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has sparked a reaction from Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Industry Alliance (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously think” about the 2020 presidential bid, Massachusetts state senator said.
Masachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would \"seriously think\" about running for president after the next midterm elections.
During a meeting at a city council in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman on top,” the source said.
“After November 6 I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city council, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was called for criticism of Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet on Friday, Warren said “of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote”.
However, the results of a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of the electoral body voting for Warren does not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will “probably” vote in Massachusetts state said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed that there is more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of voters backing a potential candidacy and 48 percent against the candidacy.
Other sound names from the Democratic Party discussed in terms of their potential bid in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About Trauma Track Palin at Donald Trump's Support Meeting
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence following an incident that took place on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s come back, can be linked to what’s happening to other families suffering from the effects of PTSD and the vulnerabilities with which our soldiers are returning,” President Donald Trump said at a rally in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a burning topic” and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, added “they come back a little different, they come back more firmly, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their comrades soldiers and pilots, and all the other military members gave for this country.”
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence - an attack on a woman, disrupting the reporting of domestic violence and possession of opiate weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a review of a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who challenge this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal police, has not been revealed.
She said she was abused by her partner \"and violent members of his gang,\" but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come in the United States, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the 2014 Immigrant Appeals Committee’s decision to allow immigrants who do not own documents and flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"neglects decades of state, federal and international law\"
“The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and that the chamber thus violates that principle,” the friendly report said.
Lawyers further argue that the police that disables entry to immigrants are causing damage to the U.S. economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “ensure the necessary workforce”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in cases related to migrants not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Azil is only available to those who leave their home countries for persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or for their political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Pal as the death toll doubles in search of survivors
The survival situation is getting worse.
“It’s very tense,” said Risa Kusum’s 35-year-old mother, comforting her sick little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Pal.
“Every minute, the ambulance delivers the bodies.
The government lacks clean water
Residents return to their ruined homes, go through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees have suffered.
Some of those injured as Dwi Harris with a broken back and shoulder are located outside the Palua Military Hospital, where patients are given help outside due to continuous strong side-effect earthquakes.
His eyes are full of tears as he talks about how he felt a powerful earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall,” Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help and then for silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my kid.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of \"violence with propaganda\"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted an ad on four pages in the U.S. newspaper Daily praising the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid addition to Des Moines Register, the country’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6th U.S. Congress election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marks, as U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where tariffs on imports are increasing.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war targeted exporters in countries such as Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime mayor of Iowa, who is China's main exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstadt wrote in a comment published in Sunday's newspaper Des Moines Register, \"now doubling this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.\"
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstadt wrote.
“In contrast, on a kiosk located here down the streets of Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any real reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China’s troubled economic path, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the firm stick of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused an offer to publish – his article, although he did not state what newspaper it was about.
Republicans stop women from voting ahead of mid-term elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans defending and standing with Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions that relate to this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to give their vote.
There is no going back in these things,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse, in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that having Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) last minute requested an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming” during demonstrations in the Senate corridor, while Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to pursue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will be huge,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he’s tall, which is true.
But he could be taller, especially among the indecisive female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of an alleged sexual assault on a Supreme Court judge, analysts felt there could be negative reactions if Republicans persisted.
“This has become a big mess for the Big Old Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it’s also about the way Republicans have addressed this issue and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priority Group, which supports the choice of Democrats.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, gently leaning aside from Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought it was the same for Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who brought the indictment, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez allegedly claims that the Supreme Court judge's candidate showed her his genitals while attending a party during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, whose creator is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupta's \"world domination\" was intention.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal data store” or “PD” (personal online data store).
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they’re all available in one browser and everyone at the same time.
What is unique to a personal data store online is that it entirely depends on the user who can access what types of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data”.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt will provide resources, processes, and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM Security Platform, a number of staff of development engineers engaged in working on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models will be completely destroyed overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on the Media platform Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid”.
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in discussing net neutrality.
Although launched by Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Open Data Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria's Cross awarded to a priest in World War I
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for attacking the towns of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won Britain's largest military recognition.
At a parade held in Rushden on Saturday, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that “the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the feat for which his grandfather received the award.
According to the newspaper London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Channel Saint-Quentin “through a very dense fog and under heavy fire from the battlefield and machine gunfire”.
He later rushed to the firing line, and with the \"greatest heroism\" he led the water forward before, without anyone's help, rushing to the Polish cannon and slaughtering three of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna was executed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were \"something I know I could never reach, but also something that provokes obedience.\"
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he \"feels honored to be part of the parade\" and added that \"the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give.\"
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellar 206, instead get Pepa Pigs
Imagine that, you stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206, to eventually prevent you from watching the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and was broadcast live during the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., just as George Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were amazed when the transmission interrupted Pepa Pigs.
Many were not impressed that they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning due to the struggle.
A fan on Twitter described this cut-off with a cartoon as “a kind of sick joke”.
“It’s about a government regulation where it says that at 6am the content was inappropriate and had to be replaced by a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator for Marketing and Communications, on a transfer issue.
“Peppa Pig,” yes.
Bellator President Scott Cocker said he would work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I talk about reprisals, I think we can probably handle it,” Cocker said.
“But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday comes, when they will be there on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the interruption occurred, there were correspondences and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't like that, it was about the government's jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt \"inferior\" about sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that it was only in high school that he realized that “not everyone is like me”.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs representing Lauren Laverne, he said he was openly talking about gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular leader of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months due to illness.
Appearing as a renegade on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt \"less valuable\" than others, because \"it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls\"
He said, “To this day, these feelings of less value and the feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that “someone,” he said, so people don’t get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals has become a very important fighter for the LGBT population and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 \"surprisingly\"
Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years old and said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you live so much while you’re so young,” he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, “it’s hard to find someone in the same years who’s experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple played the role of Robert Ray Black-Daley's parents in June, and Daley said that his \"whole perspective\" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was only about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be there to sit in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – swimming in front of a local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of the first song - Proud of Heather Small - which echoed in it as he was preparing for the Olympics and was still passing through by.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. in British summertime.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game on the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his form so that this is not an unfortunate turning point.
Mickelson, who plays at the record-breaking Biennial for the 12th time, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench in Saturday's games with four balls and four games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time main winner spent a day cheering and improving the range of the game, hoping to correct what bothers him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the height of his career, is not an ideal choice for the demanding field of Le Golf National, where long uneven terrain regularly punishes stray blows.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their matches with beginner Tommy Fleetwood this week on Sunday.
If Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely critical.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say anything more.
“He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the shoulder and embraced me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He believes in himself very much.
He's a member of the House of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I had no idea he was playing two games.
I imagined there were more of them, but that's how it went, and we thought it had to go that way.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully achieved the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought a certain intangible value to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, likes to joke with people, and it’s great to have a guy like that on the team,” he explained.
“I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game.
European Captain Thomas Björn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Björn, a European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant experience.
Dane first appeared in a game played in the town of Valderrama in 1997, when the side whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but they finished the competition with a narrow difference of 141-2-131-2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won,” said Björn, conceived after watching the 2018 team that won the 5-3 win on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this trophy and that remains the focus.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's across the street on the other side - the biggest players in the world -
Rejoiced by the performance of his players in a difficult golf tournament, Björn added: “I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual games, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you test the extreme possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
It’s a message that you have to pass on to the players – give the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he has to do the best he can.
Unlike Björn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of those big turnarounds the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed “a miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When he sets off with such a swing, he creates great pressure on midfielders.
We've formed our lineup accordingly and we've got the boys ready so we can try and perform some magic tomorrow, you know--
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to counterattack and confront Rory McIllroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
“I went with this group of guys in this lineup because I think she can cover it all the way to the end,” Björn said of choosing a singles player.
Germany's new warship is on hold again
The new frigate of the German Navy was due to be launched in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but will not arrive in at least another year due to system failures and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz,” the leading ship in the class of brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoted by the military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Navy ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, there will be a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to schedule the latest frigates up to two years without returning to the birth port.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were supposed to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete at the time of its use, Die Zeit said.
An unfortunate F125 frigate arrived in the paper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media listed a number of key “software and hardware flaws” that would make the ship, if deployed on a combat mission, unusable.
The software disadvantages were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who operated the old Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it turns out that the ship is significantly too heavy to reduce its effect and restricts the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship, the Rheinland-Pfalz, is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of a complete project, including training staff, also becomes problematic.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
Problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defense Commission, admitted that the Navy was actually “running out of ships that could be deployed”.
The official said that this problem has grown over time, as the old ships were written off and no replacement ships were purchased.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on an estate in the hills of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will be accompanied by ordinary bats and a species of soprano Pipistrelle, and a brown long-eared bat and bats of the Daubenton species in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
Employers and NHS volunteers will also do mobile research using manual detectors.
Professional analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls of bats and what types they do.
Then a map of habitats and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at NTS, hopes that the results will show what areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This data will help to determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as creating meadows, and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by works on construction and development, which negatively affect the litter and loss of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when capturing prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, inspection of litter, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threeave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“We have a large area for bats here,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all good habitats.
But there is so much more unknown about bats, so what we do here and on other estates will help us to better understand what they need to advance –
He emphasizes how important it is to check if the bats are on the property, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother's litter will kill up to 400 females and young people, which is likely to result in the extermination of the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and the law prohibits them from killing, harassing, harassing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to get involved and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how the population of most of our species develops.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers file lawsuits against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has announced the charges.
A striker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Katrina Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to stop the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his followers, whose 142 million in Instagram Live video, hours after the indictments report, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports calling them “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said in the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get glory from talking about me, but that's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything’s fine,” he added, smiling.
Ronald’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “non-material damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents delivered to Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got down on his knees after an alleged incident and told her he was “99% good guy” who failed those “1%”.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had a sexual relationship, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorga also claimed she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a non-judicial settlement because she felt \"a fear of retaliation\" and worried that \"she would be publicly humiliated\"
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking an annulment because she is still traumatised by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will \"forever regret\" if it loses its world leader status in car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that \"worrisome\" is what Toyota UK has said about the BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clark.
Japan’s automaker said the impact of delays on borders in the event that Bexit remains without an agreement could cause job losses.
A factory made by Toyota Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a halt in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the principle of “on time” where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there can be a break at the border that can lead to delays and shortages of parts towards the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock for longer than one day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the Chequers plan, which offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU, was “precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
“We need to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow as I say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he said in today’s Radio 4 program on the BBC.
“An example not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been an extremely successful series of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but warned that the long-term cost would reduce the competitiveness of the factory in the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the president of the Union Union union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, when such jobs close, they never return.
The government spokesman said: “We need to put forward an accurate and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU”.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House officials say
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be \"delayed for another week\" as a fight continues over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidate, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy general prosecutor or not, endangering Mr. Mueller's independence for months is a topic of speaking in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also discussed the sound to record talks with Trump and the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday he was at the White House, amid rumors that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he \"wouldn't like to\" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judicial Commission hearing testified by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into the case against Kavanaugh for a week, further delaying the full-fledged Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this has not yet been established, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week, considering all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press always informed --
Some journalists would deny this claim: Sanders did not hold a brief address for reporters at the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a smaller number of short speeches were not a result of the repulsiveness of the “teatral behavior” of TV journalists, although she said, “I will agree with the fact that they are exaggerating.”
She then said that direct contact between Trump and journalists would be strengthened.
“The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him,” she said without stating any evidence: “We have seen these numbers,” she said.
A brief address will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it as much as possible and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and these talks with the president of the United States will replace brief press calls --
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences when visiting officials.
Self-contained press conferences are rarity.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of a crowd of journalists unrestrained and occasionally strange.
Health Secretary writes to EU employees in National Health Service (NHS) Scotland about Brexit fears
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude to the state and a desire to stay after Brexit.
Scottish Parliament member Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to settle the costs of resolving requests for the status of EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: \"The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued during the summer, and the decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know for all of you this has been a very restless time.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Members from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
State Tigers Tennessee, Chrission Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday's defeat at 31:27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
“He reached the field line and just crashed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on the stretcher and taking it for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had finished his operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet about the type/ scope of the injury” and that Tennessee State is trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red jersey, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five total knocks on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 knockouts in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher fees for buying real estate in UK
Customers from foreign countries will be charged higher fees when buying real estate in the UK, where additional funds will be used to help homeless people according to new conservative plans
The move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Higher taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged higher fees when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will be announced today.
This step will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn, seeking to attract young voters to promises to provide more affordable housing care and to focus on those who earn more.
Higher taxes will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money strengthening the government's intention to fight outdoor sleep.
An additional fee, which, in addition to the existing tax, including higher levels, was introduced two years ago to another property and purchase for rent, could amount to as much as 3%.
The Treasury expects the move to increase revenue to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are buying people who do not have a UK residence, which is why prices are rising, and customers who first buy real estate are becoming more difficult to become homeowners.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirit cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a taxi reduction to help a larger number of young people reach their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices by buying first-time land they don’t use, and asked Mrs May to give up quotas for affordable homes as soon as possible to end Britain’s “disgrace of housing policy”.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rent and the suspension of nothing caused by the actions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new houses.
“Last year, I said I would dedicate my prime minister’s mandate to returning the British dream – that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes easily as well as valuable British.
The dream of ownership of the house has become too distant for many people, and the inhuman sleep in the open is still very real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.”
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his “extreme ambition” is to be the manager of the Scottish national team at some point.
The 40-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of the club from the northeast, which is currently in third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading one.
He moved to Light Stadium this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was in the B-team, and that was it,” Ross told Sportsound BBC Scotland.
But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be provided if I were successful in running a club –
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club chief Alloa Athletic says he didn’t feel any restlessness because he came after such big names at such a large club, after refusing to offer the clubs Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The measure of my success at the moment will be, ‘Will I be able to bring this club back to the Premier League?’”
Judging by the structure and capabilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,\" he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only be considered successful if I can get the club back where it belongs.”
Ross was only in the third year of his managerial career, following a period he spent as an assistant boss at Dambarton and 15 months as part of Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Allo recover from falling in the third category, and St. Miren pulled from the fall to the lower league until the Champions' Champions' winner next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” recalls Allo’s takeover.
“I truly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I made decent money and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I’ve always wanted to be in management and now I’ve been doing it, and I haven’t felt more comfortable in my entire adult life than I am now.”

The perfect time for a cup is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., a study reveals
The summer heat wave increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
A group of pubs and bars saw sales growth of 2.7% in July, but restaurant traffic dropped by 4.8%, as figures show.
Peter Martin, a consultant at the CGA, said: “The permanent sunny weather and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup contributed to following a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when pubs achieved an increase of 2.8%, and restaurants had an even higher drop.
The drop in traffic in restaurants of 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and drink-focused bars have achieved by far the best result with higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period, than there was a drop in traffic in restaurants.
Food-focused pubs also died from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6% in a month, with the drop in food sales by three percent.
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment and Hospitality of RSM, said: “These results continue the trend that we have witnessed since the end of April.
Weather opportunities and the impact of major social and sports events are still the main factors when it comes to selling on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although the drop in sales of 4.8% at the annual level will be particularly painful with already present price pressures.
A long hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for food-focused hosts, and time will show if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a little bit of an over-the-counter relief.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting a slower introduction of new brand growth.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales monitoring service for bars, pubs and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and represents an accepted industrial standard.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that hides from their parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret order on social networks that hides from their parents and teachers.
A study involving over 20,000 upper-school students found an increase in the number of “fake Instas” pages.

Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” order that shows their parents
Every fifth child, of whom only 11 years old, makes social media accounts that he hides from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 upper-school students revealed a sharp rise in the “fake Insta” account, which is related to the Instagram photo sharing page.
The news has increased fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “main” order that showed their parents, but they also had private orders.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret page revealed a teenage girl calling for “crap me”.
A survey conducted by the UK Digital Consciousness Organization and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It upsets the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be \"the voice of an athlete\" on the Scottish Athlete Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athlete Committee as the non-executive director of the annual assembly of that administrative body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from her rich experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from its membership on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I want to be the voice of an athlete and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic golds, including 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and is now a regular expert on the BBC, remained motionless after he had a transitory ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time can tell if I will recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!

Ads for a traitor in which mothers compare with cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that produces the traitors shared opinions on the Internet with an advertisement that compares the nursing mothers to the cows of the musari.
To mark the launch of a product described as “the first silent traitor,” the Elvie consumer technology firm released an advertisement inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom that the new pump provides to milk-producing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between a hay and a cow with a song that reads, “Yes, I do, but I don’t have a tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, but it’s not a udder, it’s my breasts.”
“Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, pump, husband to myself.”
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions from viewers, while many said it sheds light on the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and give birth just like we do to produce milk, but they take their babies away a few days after birth.
Elvie Discreetly Stands in Breastfeeding Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a traitor for mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added: “Advertise without any sense”
Others have stood up for advertising, and one woman has admitted that her song is \"urneous\"
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy this if I were still breastfeeding.
My betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercials are a little silly, but I got her right.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at milk-producing moms (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and they feel like “cows”.
This is not an advertisement that praises or gives rise to the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who issue milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wire or pipe and stands in the breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even go out while they issue milk.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “Pump Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By pulling the parallel between the breastfeeding and the cows of the muzar we wanted to focus on the milk issue and all the challenges that go along with it, presenting in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has come into the headlines.
During the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to find guardians for children.
Traditionally, most of the guardians themselves were immigrants without documents who were afraid to threaten their ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs official, told Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The department later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had not been convicted before.
“Nearly 80% of people who are either guardians or household members of the guardians are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we're going to keep looking for those people, Mr Albence said.
In an effort to make children go through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules under which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, workers at the shelter say.
Many will report a video call instead of personally, in order to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who are found not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain closed, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to an outbreak of anger or an attempt to escape, according to employees of the shelter and reports coming from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks are raised in larger institutions like the one in the city of Tornillo, where because of its size it is much easier to overlook signs that indicate that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish \"occupation forces\"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the war in the country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegal in Syria, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and \"will deal with them appropriately\"
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said in a session.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism” in Syria was almost over – where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “a holy fight until we have wiped out all Syrian terrorists – including terrorist groups and “every foreign presence”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly in charge of training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed \"some Western countries\" for \"expanding irrational fears\" that encourage refugees not to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue,” he said.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal has deterred a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia in a province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had \"clear deadlines\" and expressed hope that a military action against jihadists and fighters from the Nussar front would be launched, linked to al Qaeda, \"to be eradicated\"
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare a path to the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions of the government of Syria for participation in the work of the committee, saying that the work of the body should be limited to \"considering the members of the current constitution\" and warning of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
Under this logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, what many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the impeachment and scandal have previously suspended his mandate.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to the presidential term of all time”.
So far, there is no indication of the fatigue of the viewer.
Since 2014, the strike-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in impact terms, unlike four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and the Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC exceeded the cable channel rating with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with impact news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of the drama “Choose Survivors” on ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of “Only funny parts: and a few harsh truths about getting into a Hollywood boys club,” has a different theory.
She remembers taxi rides in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos also has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of abortion laws from Roe v. Wade, whether immigrants will be able to connect and what the state of the global economy will be.
Turning it off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you had been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the “deep background” sources for his book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s Noah’s leather jacket worth $15,000 (“the suit with a thick set of ingress,” wrote the Washington Post) and the implications of the picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump, given by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I will never look at Super Mary again with the same eyes.
“Part of what he makes you see him as a reality show is that he feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “The pawnshop” by commenting on the rotation of the cast and the daily plots of Trump’s show (criticizing the American football league, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai was sunny at a temperature of about 80 degrees (27°C), but he shut himself in and watched MSNBC and simultaneously recorded CNN.
He could not separate himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Big cash inflows from the side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a cash flood, thanks to the re-allocation of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent border crossing in the suburbs of Pittsburgh led to the election of Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who came to the head of the second district after the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a fight to fund a campaign between the main party fund collectors, the Committee that raises funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a widely watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts gave little advantage to Democrats.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdrawing.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include reducing financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have been difficult to hit this Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was supposed to be a continuation of a similar last year's summit that was a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and in fact stopped any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next issue could be a report by special investigator Robert Mueller on a possible Trump obstruction of the judiciary, which now has significant evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation into discovering a possible link between the Trump campaign and Russia’s attack on the election.
If a majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to re-enter the voters, and perhaps even the jury.
It's very quiet, and I don't want to suggest Mr. Trump's fall, or those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to strike Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breaking points, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing more of these breaking points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Chief Prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unenviable position since this newspaper reported last year that he had proposed a secret shooting of the president and made speculation that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times testimony is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of that, are we going to vote in midterm elections for a Congress that Mr. Trump will hold accountable?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep for a long winter's sleep.
But I don't think we're going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I was ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with a cowardly cross.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapido from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel, would put them in a good position to qualify from the G European League.
Knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until the draw-off match with Villareal 2-2, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use the result as a springboard.
“It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We got into the game believing that we could achieve something and we went with the point.
We may have been able to take them to the end, but all in all, the unresolved result is probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second and we were better.
We are expecting a big European evening again on Thursday.
We hope we can take three points, but it will be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, although with the support of the audience we can surely push through and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly hard, starting with everything that happened to my injuries to changes in the club itself, but now we are satisfied with what we have now.
The team is in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we train well.
I hope we can continue, leave last season behind and be successful.
Women Can't Sleep With Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be taken care of, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people covered by the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they talked to their children about it.
“People want someone from the family to take care of them, but they don’t want to start a conversation on the subject,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance sector.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to give you care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family and consider where and how to be given him, because such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you and figure out a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance hybrid policy with cash value to help you cover those costs or self-sustaining with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Create an authorization to make medical care decisions to have an authorized person of trust who will monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider and conclude a financial power of attorney agreement.
This means that you choose a person from a trust that will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain powerless.
Do not forget the small details: imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and that he is being taken to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.

Who will take care of the dog?

Man shot with multiple shots from Ilfracombe air rifle
One man was shot with multiple shots from an air rifle as he walked home from his evening out.
The victim, in her forties, was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. in British summertime, as a “accidental act”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called on witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
As ties broke, aid officials could not get any information from the Donggala province, areas north of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a county that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit Western Donggal in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that plunging the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, which caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jay region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of 2004 earthquakes and tsunamis.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed in the demolition of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 people dead, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily captured.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wassilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructed domestic violence and resisted arrest, according to a report released by the Alaska State Police Agency on Saturday.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin was detained in the Mat-su detention unit and was given a probationary bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that “it was certainly not his fault,” the network said.
Palin is faced with three A-class offenses, meaning he faces a prison sentence of up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B offense, punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time any criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, has called on police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disrupting domestic violence and possession of alcoholized weapons linked to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed following an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a disruption of connections and electricity supplies, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake epicenter was right next to the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Pal when the tsunami clung to the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a death penalty request filed in the southern New York District.
Both of these points allow the death penalty to be pronounced, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saip of 22 counts of murder and racketeering charges, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and premeditation,” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried him out as “disgust, cruel and corrupt”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaewic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erri, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca,” said in a request for sentencing.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the southern district of New York last had a case in which the death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in some federal case in New York was executed in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both of the Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 on an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed – by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of acquittal for the admission of guilt, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saip's defense has previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage has pledged to \"mobilize the People's Army\" during protests at a Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said politicians had to \"feel dissatisfaction\" with Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's lawmakers suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would \"exit\" that Mr. Farage was the Brexit secretary so far.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in an attempt to unify its deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who advocated staying in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks by both supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she continue to try to make an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “haos”.
Mr. Bone said at an event to go is to go to Solihull that he wants to “reject Chequers”.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I’m going to fight for Brexit, but we have to kick Chequers out.”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be subjective.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone has rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely inaccurate.”
Brexit supporters Andrea Yankees, who also attended the rally, told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The plan from Chequers is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
\"Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening\"
In Mrs May’s harsh message, she added: “Premiers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage told the crowd that politicians must “feel dissatisfied” if they are about to fail the 2016 referendum decision.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to play Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that won’t work out for you.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel dissatisfaction.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-confident, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A few activists waved to the banners \"Tories against Brexit\" after forming a group this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security issues they had with the party's app at the opening of the conference.
“These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canada Plus plan for an unhindered state of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s all a complete farce.
A good Brexit is not possible,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts native spoke about her future during a participatory meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, again ran for the November election against Republican representative at the House of Representatives of Geoffrey Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation to face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors using a participatory meeting format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, and that included a woman in the lead.
The arrest after LSU Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday a suspect's arrest for a shooting that killed basketball player LSU Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. at a press conference.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released, asking for help finding a man on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday.
Wade Sims was shot in the head as a result of which he died, police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of the weapon, and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and detained at East Baton Rouge County Police Station.
Junior of the 6-stop-6 who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played 32 games with 10 starts and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 hits, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his order ensures victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and urged Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton behind to engage in traffic at the start, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered boxing one round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel made Ferrari reluctant to leave the free interior at the risk of falling behind after a double move in the defense of the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran most of the race relying on his tyres to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally reached boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight rounds until Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Waltheri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was the real gentleman who let me through.
The team did a really great job of achieving one or two formative finishes,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Feinsten at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not release a letter to Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly testify to Ford’s Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, mean and lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and mean and lying, he said.
When you look at the publications and the information that leaked to the public, and then they say, \"Oh, I didn't do it.\"
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information to the public?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public - no matter what?
Oh, no.
I didn't let the public--
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
In July, Ford sent a letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh, which leaked in early September – yet Feinsten denied that the information had leaked from her office.
I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t let her story out,” Feinstein told the committee.
She asked me to keep it a secret and kept it secret, as she asked me to.
But her denial did not come upon the approval of the president, who at the rally on Saturday night commented: Let me tell you, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, whom three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president has insinuated to use the Democrats for their own purposes.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see meanness, wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control, \"The Mediaite reports the words of the president.
Elite league: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made amends for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elte League on Friday with a 5-to-3 win in a back match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants at the very beginning gained an advantage of two goals by shooting Patrick Dwayer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the equality before Dwyer regained the leadership of Giants.
François Bouchard was equal to Dundee before two of Lunvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
It was the third loss in the Elte League season for Adam Keef's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting in the season of the two sides, and the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwayer opened the match in the fourth minute, 3:35, with the assistance of Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvilier and doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a crowd at the beginning, Sullivan returned the home team to play at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie for equalization at 15:16 a.m.
Until the first break, Dwyer secured the lead of Giants by the second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home team overgrouped, and Bouchard once again led them to equalization in the goal force measurement at 27:37 minutes.
Cownie and Charles unitedly helped Nielsen bring Dundee to the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored the fifth goal in the middle of the final period to ensure his team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four games so far, welcome Milton Keynese in the next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid an earthquake.
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died, ensuring a safe flight of aircraft with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, launching a tsunami.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
Despite his colleagues fleeing trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu Airport, which rocked heavily.
He stayed to ensure a safe take-off of the Batika Air Flight 6321, which at the time stood on the runway.
When he realized that the control tower was breaking down, he jumped off it.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
Our heart breaks because of this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state disaster relief agency says the approach to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow as many bodies remain below the ruins, and many cannot be reached,\" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
Waves reaching height and up to six meters have devastated the Pale, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: \"The ambulances are delivering bodies every minute.\"

Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is working fast to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.”
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the army of the country: I ask you all to work all day to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? – CNN Report.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
The plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini announces that after the plane crash in the lagoon, one person is being run as if they were missing.
An airline whose aircraft crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one person is being run missing after it said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon they were unable to trace the passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to inquiries for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline said six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had ended up in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane flew over the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to get through to the emergency exit through the water that reached their waist on the sinking plane.
He said the crew was in a panic and were yelling, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working nearby to repair the dock also helped rescue the boat with an inflatable boat that transported passengers to the coast before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
The data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in the crash of airlines registered in PNG in the past two decades, but none of them have been involved in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the sequence of events on the night when a woman is burned alive.
The prosecutor's office ended the case in a repeated procedure against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
American Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has been an expert in intelligence analysis for hours.
Before the jury, he said he was using cell phone data to take a picture of the movements of accused Quinton Tellis, 29, and victims of Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford said he was not in town that day.
Asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers had met about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information after Chamber's death from his phone.
He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects a jury trial to take place later in the day.
The High Breed: What is an Aware hip-hop?
Hip-hop seeks to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when dealing with political messages and social topics.
They want to return to their roots and restore popularity to the conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fuguees and Commons again gain popularity in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York's nanny sues the couple for quitting after a racist text message.
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was another black person.
The couple denies being racist, estimating the lawsuit as extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when, upon her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she realized that she was the new carer of children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
Another black woman wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
When she became aware of her gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was an African-American, had been doing her job badly and expected a Filipino woman instead.
Mrs. Maurice was compensated for a day's work and was sent home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for dismissal, as well as a $350 a day fee for six months, to how she was originally hired to live with her family, although without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding that this is discrimination.
The couple on charges of racism responded that canceling Maurica's engagement was reasonable because they feared that once they offended her they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told Post husband.
But would you trust your children with someone you offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on.
Occupying the lawsuit as extortion, “Plasco said that his wife received only two months of maternity leave and that she was in a very difficult situation”.
Are you going to pursue someone like that?
That’s not very nice,” added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court was quick to condemn money on social networks, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
Puddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: It’s hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publishing.
It’s very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington’s success.
Saying that her father, who, before being inspired by a little stuffed bear, would have worked for the BBC as a cameraman, would have been positive if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of puddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family.
He was a quiet man, he did not like to boast,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something to you and you were proud of him, even though it was not really your merit.
I think he looked at the success of puddington in some way.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination , he always credited all the merits to the puddington himself . . .
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was immediately transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
Above regularly called to say that it was bad, and that they did not expect to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be with you soon, too.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep the heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She died just a few moments before that, and it all went away.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered...
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now in mourning for her daughter's death, boarded a plane along with other passengers, who did not even dream of the torment she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I bowed my head, and my tears kept running down my face.
Well, that's hard to explain, but in the summer, I was overwhelmed by sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The grieving women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the Welsh bridge set up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression to commit suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want a parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would light up every room.
Before his death, however, he left work because he was in a very dark phase.
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, \"I'm constantly worried that this will leave consequences.\"
Mrs. Davis designed these cards to let people know that there is someone you can contact and who you can talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Do not sit down and shut up - talk -
Mrs. Humpreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, or anything else,” she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he was at the very bottom - when the children opened their gifts he did not look them in the eyes or anything else -
She says his death for them was a huge trauma, but they have to get through it: It leaves a huge gap in the family.
That's what's tearing us apart.
But we'll keep going and fight--

With the opening of the FBI investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought if we could really pull something out of what he was looking for -- an investigation of limited duration and scope -- maybe that would somewhat unite us,\" Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding he fears the board is falling apart - due to intransigence of party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is caused by the choice of the moment.
The elections for Congress are held in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if Republicans go bad, as expected, their attempts to elect their man to the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
On Saturday, George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The Senate will vote, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavnaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court by his vote.
The number of crossings from North Korea is falling under Kim.
The number of North Korea's breakaways to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Referring to data from the South Korea Unification Ministry, Byeong-seug Park said last year that 1127 escapes were recorded compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said the two decisive factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs people traffickers charge.
Pyongyang didn't go public.
The vast majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people are fleeing China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often brings them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have been noticeably improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss halted denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, which reached a broader agreement to work on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on the lack of progress so far.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we do not take into account that we are the first to arm ourselves unilaterally,” RI said in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical, saying he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader at Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives called Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate hysteric \"and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help thinking that if she ever acted like that, she would have called it hysterical,” Pelosi told the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both teenagers.
During his introductory presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and biting when he talked about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, estimating allegations against him by a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality – organised by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not hold office in the Supreme Court as it showed his bias at the expense of the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he goes against the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Asked if he would try to recall Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats were to get a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi insisted.
I will say the following: if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but not in the court he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the judge of District Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about any rulings made by Kavanaughi against the Law on affordable health care or in the case of Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether to reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It’s not the time to put a hysterical, biased person in court and we’re expected to say that’s not wonderful,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justified anger, anger that has been gathering for months and years, and it cannot be resolved without wages.
We cry when we are angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was somewhere an executive, and who said she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that implied that when she got angry and started crying, the person she would talk to said you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry--
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great.
Tears are allowed a way to get rid of anger in part and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in an office where most of the men were men, is that once I cried because of indescribable anger, an older woman - a cold boss I was always afraid of - grabbed my neck and pulled out of the staircase.
I never let them see me cry,” she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
When Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the ship Monkey Business in 1987 and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
That wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me through laughter 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another one.
“Someone called it Snow White and seven dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already a long way off, she was falling behind in raising funds, and she vowed not to enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions - with gratitude to the people who supported her, with frustration over a system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and with anger at chauvinism - from which she got stuck in her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown, \"remembered Mrs. Schroeder how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were gonna put on my monument?
She cried, “
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canonads of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and while the end of the battle is not yet seen, the rift between countries in the long run can be of benefit to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export items including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest blow happened this week with new tariffs hitting $200 billion (£150 billion), which practically taxed half of all goods coming from China in the United States.
Beijing has responded with the same measure each time, and the latest tariffs are five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond with the same measure, and the second-largest global economy seems to be not going to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to meet the demands, but public worship would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, U.S. pressures in the trade war can support China in the long-term by reducing the dependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a devastating economic decline in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding a war-torn country that has been going on for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and existence.
Since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be able to help rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that assisted the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 on the Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown while Danish captain Thomas Björn's team won the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, threw the ball into the water at 16th hole of the pair, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds, becoming one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament started in this format.
Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Throbjörn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 of Ian Poulter from England to whom this may have been the last Ryder Cup.
Veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of the tournament of all time with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy to have won the Cup again.
Here is an important team and I’m glad I could be of help,” said the emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He handed the relay to his countryman John Ram who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in individual matches on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a record career of 13-21-3 on the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the best players of all time who won 14 top titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had been struggling all weekend to find a way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team’s disappointing performance, US captain Jim Furyk said, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, there were times when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup board, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're outplayed--
Latest news about the flowering of the sea: concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Mantee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Commission on the conservation of fish and natural habitat of Florida shows a general decline in the concentration of seafloor in parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, sporadic flowering has been reported in areas of Pinellas, Mentee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which indicates a decrease in concentration.
The surface of the flowering sea extends to about 130 miles of coastline from Pinellas County to Lee County in the south.
The booming surfaces appear about 10 miles from the shores of Hillsborough County, but in smaller places compared to last week.
