Last month, there were large protests in Poland after the state signed ACTA, as a result of which the Polish government decided not to ratify the agreement so far.
Latvia and Slovakia have slowed the process of joining the Trade Agreement on Counterfeiting (ACTA).
The Society for the Liberation of Animals and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (RSPCA) once again called for the mandatory installation of video surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
Observations and inspections of slaughterhouses must be common in Australia, the head of RSPCA New South Wales Chief Inspector David O'Chancey told ABC.
“The surveillance system will certainly send a strong signal to people working with animals that their well-being has the highest priority.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey Office’s international map of earthquakes, there were no earthquakes in Iceland last week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Service has also reported that there has been no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours.
The significant earthquake activity, which led to the phase change, took place on March 10 in the northeastern part of the volcano’s caldera.
Dark clouds are reported at the foot of the mountain, unrelated to volcanic activity.
It was possible for clouds to cause confusion about whether there was really an eruption.
The moon had 120 to 160 m3 of fuel on board, when the strong winds and waves pushed it into the wave.
All 12 crew members were rescued by helicopters and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter ship was about to take its usual cargo of fertilizers, and the authorities initially feared that the ship could spill its cargo.
The amendment to the proposal was already adopted by both chambers in 2011.
A change was made in this legislative session when the second sentence was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then adopted in a similar form by the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes a ban on same-sex civil marriage, could likely open a door to civil marriage in the future.
Following the process, the HJR-3 decision will be reviewed again in 2015 or 2016 by the next elected legislative body to continue the process.
Outside the directorate, Votier's achievements included a hunger strike in 1973 against what he considered political censorship.

Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory, who claims to have trained 9,000 students in the midst of his career.
Some parents consider the harsh words used by him in the notes, and it is claimed that he used a mockery in class.
Modern education accused him of printing large bus ads without permission and lying, saying he was the main English language teacher.
He was previously charged with copyright infringement, but was not charged.
A former student said that “he used jargon in class, taught skills to walk meetings with notes, and was just like a friend of the students.”
China has developed a market economy in the last three decades, although it has officially remained a communist state.
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were carried out.
Since then, China’s economic size has grown 90 times.
Last year, China first exported more cars from Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest car market.
Up to twenty years of Chinese GDP may be higher than that of the United States.
The tropical storm Daniel, the fourth known storm of the 2010 hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, some 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum constant winds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that by Wednesday, Daniel will become a hurricane.
As the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the Caribbean or the United States.
Bobek, who was born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, became famous while playing for “Partizan Belgrade”
He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.
He scored 403 goals in 468 appearances over time with the team.
No one else has participated and has scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was named the best player in the history of Partizan.
The celebrations began with a special show of the famous worldwide corpse Cirque du Soleil.
The following performances were then on the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Yanisar Orchestra and singers Fatih Erkozich and Muslum Gures.
Then the spinners came out on stage.
Turkish wild Sezen Aksu sings alongside Greek singer Harris Alexiu and Italian tenor Alessandro Safina.

13-year-old motorcyclist Peter Lenz died after being involved in an accident on the Indianapolis track.
Lenz fell off his bike as he warmed up and was then hit by his fellow racer Xavier Zayt.
He was examined immediately by the medical team on the runway and transported to a local hospital where he died later.
Zayt was harmless after the incident.
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero continued, saying that the financial system is an essential part of the economy.
We have a one-year financial crisis, whose sharpest moment has been in the last two months, but I think that now financial markets are starting to recover.
Last week, the broadcast “Night News” announced that it would dramatically increase its international language mandate for news coverage with three new broadcasts.
Teaching in English and Japanese, the global organization is launching programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, Internet and mobile devices.
“Nothing happened to me, fortunately, but I saw a horrible scene because people were trying to break windows to get out.
People used chairs to hit the windows, but the windows didn't break.
Survivor Francis Kowal said that one of the windows had finally broken and they started coming out of the window.
Because of the energy generated by the unification of hydrogen atoms (or their merger) to form heavier elements, the stars emit light and heat.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can produce energy in a similar way.
However, this is a very difficult task to solve and it will take many years before we see the construction of useful synthesis reactors.
The steel needle is held on the surface of the water due to surface tension.
The reason for the surface tension is that the water molecules on the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules create invisible skin on its surface, which allows things like the needle to float from above.
The blade of the modern hook has a double edge with a dent in the middle. The two edges provide better grip on the ice, even on a slope.
The edge, which is in contact with the ice, also curves, as the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, while it tilts towards one side or the other.
This allows the skater to turn. If the hooks tilt to the left, the skater turns left, if the hooks bend to the right, the skater turns right.
They need to get rid of the extra energy they receive from the light to return to their previous energy level.
They do this by radiating small particles of light called “photons”.
This process is called by scientists \"stimulated radiation radiation\" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing photons to emit, and light is a kind of radiation.
The following photo shows broadcasting photons atoms. In fact, of course, photons are much smaller than those in the photo.
The photons are smaller than even the matter that builds the atoms.
After hundreds of hours of work, finally the spiral in the bulb burns and it no longer works.
The bulb should be changed afterwards. You should be careful when changing the electric light bulb.
First, the switch for the lighting body or the cable should be turned off.
This is obtained because the electricity flowing into the contact where the metal part of the bulb is located can cause a strong electric shock. This can happen if you touch the inner part of the contact or the metal base of the bulb, while it is still partially located in the contact.
The main organ of the blood system is the heart, which has the function of a blood pump.
The blood moves away from the heart of a tube called “arteries” and returns back to the heart of a tube called “vains” – the smallest pipes are called “capillaries”.
The triceratops could chew with their teeth not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, triceratops ate cicadas, which are a type of plant common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants are like miniature palm trees with a crown of sharp, barbed leaves.
The triceratops may have used their healthy man to peel off the leaves before eating the stem.
There are also scientists who argue that these plants are very poisonous and it is unlikely that any dinosaur has eaten them, although nowadays the sloths and other animals like parrots (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would I be attracted to the gravity of Jo? If you stepped on his surface, you would weigh less than when you were on Earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will be about 36 pounds (16 kg) of Jo.
Unlike Earth, the Sun doesn't have a crust you can step on, it's all made of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas sinks away from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the Sun that we see when we look at it is called “photosphere” or “ball of light”.
The Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, just like the moon about 3,000 years later, in 1610.
The phases occur because only the sun-turned side of Venus (or the moon) is illuminated. The phases of Venus support Copernicus's theory that planets orbit the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, the English astronomer Jeremiah Horox observed the transit of Venus.
England is experiencing a long period of peace after the retake of Danlo.
However, in 991, Etelred faced a Viking fleet larger than any other of the time of Gutrum century earlier.
This fleet is led by Olaf Trigvason, a Norwegian with ambitions to free his country from Danish rule.
After the initial military failures, Ettelred was able to agree on the terms of his return to Norway, who was trying to win the kingdom with mixed success.
Hangul is the only targeted alphabet popular in everyday use. The alphabet was created in 1444 during the reign of King Sejon (1418 – 1450).
King Sejon is the fourth and most respected king of the Choson Dynasty.
Initially, he named the \"Hunmin Jeongeum\", the Hangeul alphabet, meaning \"the right sounds for instructing people.\"
There are many theories of how the Sanskrit appeared, one of which is for the migrants from the West Aryans who brought the language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Sanskrits, the Sanskrit simply faded due to a hierarchy.
As Latin is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish, Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that has been used as a source of many modern Indian languages.
With the end of the battle for France, Germany began preparing to invade the British island.
The codename of Germany's attack was Operation Siilayan, most of the heavy weapons and ammunition of the British army were lost during its evacuation from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German fleet (Kriegsmarine) and could destroy any invading ships sent across the Channel.
However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were located near the likely route of invasion, as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by the German airstrikes.
Italy was mainly the “little brother” of Japan and Germany.
There was a weaker army and a weaker fleet, although they had built four new ships just before the start of the war.
To conquer these countries, they had to own a platform so that the troops could cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
It was therefore necessary to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, Italian warships did not have to do anything else.
Like Britain, Japan was an island country.
The submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and stay there for a long period of time.
The submarines were used during the First and Second World Wars, then they were very slow and had a very limited firing range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the surface of the sea, but when the radar began to develop and become more accurate so as not to be noticed, the submarines were forced to sail underwater.
The German submarines were called \"submarine boats\" - the Germans were very good at navigating and managing their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans with the submarines, after their war they are not trusted to own many of them.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes called King Tut or “The Boy King,” is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian pharaohs of the time.
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in antiquity and was not listed in most lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 turned him into a celebrity. Although many tombs of the past were robbed, this was left almost intact.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun are well-preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of wheels with spikes made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster and more well-prepared to outrun the soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows of their deadly artillery can break through the armor of rivals. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The Cavalry is an army that fights a horse. The Assyrian Cavalry fought on the bare backs of its horses, as the saddle was not yet invented.
Omir - the legendary blind poet who created two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems “Iliad” and “Odysseus” are probably the most famous representative of this culture.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular dramatists and their plays are considered to be some of the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, best known for his famous theorem on the connections between the sides of the rectangular triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is believed that it is between the second and fourth most commonly used language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether the very closely related dialects are counted or not.
The estimated estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary, but they are written differently; those who speak both languages can usually understand each other in everyday conversations.
In the 15th century, Northern Estonia was under the strong cultural influence of Germany.
In their desire to bring God closer to local people, some German monks invented the Estonian literal language.
It is based on the German alphabet by adding one letter to the German alphabet.
Over time, many words borrowed from the German language merged. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
More tradition, the heir to the throne enters the army directly after completing school.
Charles, however, enrolls the University of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studies anthropology and archaeology, and later his history and gets 2:2 (lower second grade).
The first member of the British royal family, awarded with a degree, was Charles.
Three percent of the country is covered by European Turkey (East Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula).
The territory of Turkey is more than 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) long and over 800 km (500 miles) wide, with the rough shape of a rectangle.
The area of Turkey, including the lakes, occupies 783 562 sq. km (300 948 sq. km), of which 755 688 sq. km (291 773 sq. km) are in southwestern Asia and 23 764 sq. km (9 174 sq. km) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and has the size of city France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by three seas: Aegean to the west, Black to the north and Mediterranean to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history but has been independent since 1839.
The present-day parts of Belgium became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of 1830, but were part of Luxembourg in the past.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but it was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
Luxembourg became the founder of the organization, known today as the European Union, in 1957.
Drukgial Dzong is a Buddhist monastery and a destroyed fortress in the upper part of the Paro region (Pondi).
It is rumored that Jabdrung Ngawang Namgiel built the fortress in 1649 to mark his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian army.
In 1951, only some of Dzong Drokgial's relics survived, such as the image of Jabdrung Ngawang Namgial.
After the fire, the fortress is preserved and protected and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational landmarks.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was pressed between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais captured Cambodia several times in the 18th century, and Phnom Fene was destroyed in 1772.
In the last years of the 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
18% of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those employed work in the field of the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans are employed in the service sector, nearly a quarter are employed in the industry, and one-fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans, and the country is a net exporter, although only one percent of people are employed in the oil industry.
At the beginning of the independence of the country, the expertise of the Singapore Botanical Gardens helped the island become a tropical City-Garden.
Vanda Miss Hoakim, a hybrid orchid, was chosen as the country's national flower in 1981.
Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million lawns move to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River through the hills to the north because of the rains.
And then back to the north, passing through the western territory and again crossing the Mara River after the rains around April.
The territory of Serengeti in Tanzania includes the Serengeti National Park, the protected Ngorongoro area and the Maswa hunting reserve, as well as the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires common and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive classes (storyboard, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate your perceptions of media production and learn to think non-linearly.
Interactive design requires the components of a project to connect with each other, but also to make sense as a separate unit.
The focal complexity and the number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than in ordinary lenses, and this is the lack of magnification lenses.
This problem is getting smaller as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This allowed the zoom lenses to produce quality images, which is compared to what has been achieved with the lenses with a fixed focus length.
Another disadvantage of the enlarged lenses is that usually the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is lower.
This makes cheap scalding lenses difficult to use without flashing at low light levels.
Among the most common problems when trying to convert a film into a DVD format is overscanning.
Most televisions are designed to please the general public.
Therefore, everything you see on TV is with cut edges on top, bottom and side.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called an image that exceeds the frame of the screen.
When you make a DVD, its ends, unfortunately, will most likely be cut off and if the video has subtitles too close to the bottom end, they will not be fully shown.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, citing images of King Arthur's tennis, feasts, and knightly spirit.
While standing among the millennial ruins, it is not difficult to hear the sounds and smell the smells of long-lasting battles, you almost hear the tapering of the hoofs on the paws and smell the fear rising from the underground pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why are castles built at all? How are they designed and built?
The Curby McSlow Castle is typical of this period and more like a fortified house than a real castle.
Large glass windows and thin walls would not be able to withstand a decisive attack for a long time.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings was engaged in its construction, the country was relatively calm and needed protection only against small groups of wandering marroders.
The balance of powers was a system in which European countries sought to preserve the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European nations must strive to prevent a nation from becoming strong, and national governments often change their alliances to keep the balance.
The first war, the main issue of which was the balance of forces, was the war on the Spanish heritage.
This is an important change, as the European powers no longer have the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War will be the last war called \"religious\"
At the fire carried out by Herostrate on July 21, 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed.
According to history, his motivation was at all costs to achieve fame. The outraged epics announced that the name of Herostrate had never been entered.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, and so we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night Alexander the Great was born.
As king, Alexander proposed to take over the cost of the restoration of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
While you’re still hitting all the notes correctly, make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible; also try not to make very inconsistent movements with your fingers.
So you will get tired as little as possible. Remember that you do not need to press the keys strongly for the extra power of the sound, as is the piano.
To get an extra volume in the chordeon, use more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the search for communication, identification, or conscious awareness of complete reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
Direct experience, intuition, or insight into the divine reality / deity or deities, seeks the believer.
Followers adopt certain life practices designed to nourish these experiences.
Mysticism can be recognized among other forms of religious belief and worship by emphasizing the direct personal experience of an unrepeatable state of consciousness, especially with a peaceful, insightful, blissful or even exultant character.
The Sikh religion is from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century from the Punjab region from a sectarian division in the Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs consider their faith to be a religion separate from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion \"Gurmat\", meaning \"the path of guru\" in Panjab, is a fundamental aspect in all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has gained meaning, forming the core of beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539).
However, in June 1956 Kruschev's promises were tested. At the same time, the revolts in Poland, where workers protested the lack of food and the reduction of wages, became a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he accepted some economic demands and agreed to appoint a new prime minister, the popular Vladislav Gomulka.
Covering most of present-day Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan is the civilization of the Indus Valley, which is a bronze civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.
Civilization flourished in the Indus River region, where its name originated.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization existed in the pools of the already dried Sarasvati River, it must be called Ind-Sarasvati civilization, while some call it Harapah Civilization of the Harapa name, the first of its objects to be excavated in 1920.
The development of medicine was aided by the military character of the Roman Empire.
Emperor Augustus began to recruit doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corps to be used after the battles.
The surgeons knew various sedatives, including morphine from poppy seed extracts and scopolamine from herbal seeds.
They gain extensive experience in amputations to save patients from gangrene, as well as the use of turnickets and arterial clamps to stop blood flow.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire has led to enormous advances in medicine and has formed much of our knowledge today.
Purland Origami is an origami with the restriction that only one fold can be made at a given time, more complex folds such as reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced pushers or people with limited motor skills.
Children develop an understanding of race and race stereotypes, and these stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify themselves with a racial minority, which is stereotypical, not doing well in school, after learning about the stereotype associated with their race, usually do not do well in school.
MySpace currently has 54 million user profiles and is the third most popular website used in the United States.
These websites have attracted a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites have positive aspects that include the ability to easily create a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other features.
You can get easy access to this page by providing only one web address that makes it easier to remember and write for students who would have problems using a keyboard or spelling.
It can be customized to read easily and also with many or little color, according to your desire.
Attention deficit syndrome is a neurological syndrome whose classic triad of symptoms includes impulsiveness, a tendency to distraction and hyperactivity or excess energy.
This is not a learning difficulty, but a learning disorder; it affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps up to 2 million American children.
Children with attention deficit syndrome (ADD) find it difficult to focus on schoolwork, but can concentrate on things they like to do, play games, or write sentences without a point, or watch their favorite animations.
These children tend to get involved in a lot of trouble because they “have risky behavior, go into battle, and seek authority to stimulate their brain, because their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
Attention deficit syndrome affects relationships with other peers because other children cannot understand why they behave this way, or why they spell in this way, or that their level of maturity is different.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed in the above-mentioned way, the basic speed at which knowledge is acquired has also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There is no pressure anymore within the framework of individual cancellation, now the focus is on the possibility of canceling text.
In general, through the Renaissance, the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge has changed significantly.
Unlike other primates, hominids already use their hands to carry weights, swing trees and move.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight when walking with a bone.
The human hand has more phalanges and is shorter than the foot.
The fossil bones of the hand from two to three million years of age reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from movement to processing.
Some people believe that the frequent experience of many artificially induced conscious dreams can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is due to clear dreams that increase the time between fast-moving eye conditions (REM).
With less REM at night, this condition in which you actually sleep and your body recovers becomes too rare and becomes a problem.
It's just as exhausting as waking up every 20 or 30 minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain is trying to dream clearly at night.
In North Africa almost from the beginning, things haven't been going well for the Italians. Within a week after the declaration of war by Italy on June 10, 1940, the British 11 - this Hussar regiment conquered Fort Capucho in Libya.
The British captured the main engineer of the Italian 10th Army, General Lastucci, in an ambush east of Bardia.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, governor general of Libya and successor to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire during a landing in Tobruk.
Contemporary sports fechtuk is practiced at many levels - from students next to the university, to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is practiced mainly in the form of a duel, with one fan duel with another.
In the game of golf players use sticks to hit the balls against holes.
18 holes are played during a regular round, with players usually starting from the first hole of the field and ending at the age of eighteen.
The player who takes the slightest hits or moss with the bat to finish the track wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass next to the hole is cut low and is called green.
Probably the most common type of tourism is the one that connects with travel by most people: recreational tourism.
When people go to a place that is very different from their normal daily life to relax and have fun, we talk about it.
The beaches, theme parks and campsites are often the most visited places by holiday tourists.
If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to get to know its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can look at different attractions in the country or choose to focus on only one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonizers also called for support.
The troops, strengthening the front positions, included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 men under the command of Colonels James Reed and John Stark (both later became generals).
On the fence at the northern end of the colonist position, Stark's men took up positions.
When the outflow opened a gorge along the Mystic River River River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall to the north, ending at the edge of the water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a stake about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered that there be no shooting until civilians crossed.
The U.S. plan envisioned coordinated attacks from three different countries.
General John Kadwalder would launch a rogue attack on the British garrison in Bordentown to block possible reinforcements.
General James Ewing will take over the 700-strong Trenton ferry, take the bridge over Asunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main storm force of 2,400 people will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one under Greene's command, and one under Sullivan's command to take an attack before a doubt.
With a change in running from a quarter mile to a half mile, the speed becomes much smaller, while endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, a first-class 800-meter runner, a person who can run the distance in less than two minutes, should have a high speed, but endurance should be trained at any cost.
Several cross country runs in winter, combined with gymnastics exercises for the upper body, are the best preparation for the refugee season.
Only proper eating practices can not give an excellent result, but they can significantly affect the overall good health of young athletes.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, having effective hydration habits and understanding the different aspects of the use of supplements, athletes can improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports.
There are many misconceptions about the small equipment, which is required to participate in the running of average distances, which is a relatively cheap sport.
If necessary, products can be purchased, but most of them will have little or no real impact on the result.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a particular product even when it does not bring real benefits to them.
The atom can be regarded as one of the main building blocks of all matter.
This is a very complex unit, which according to the simplified model of Bohr consists of central nuclei and surrounding electrons around it, something similar to the planets around the sun - see Fig. 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: protons and neutrons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, while neutrons do not have at all. The charge of electrons is negative.
Before you check the victim, you should first check the site and make sure you are safe.
When approaching the victim, you need to notice his or her position and any automatic red flags.
If you hurt yourself while trying to help, you can only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and black-eyedness mediated the relationship between pain and disability in those suffering from lower back pain.
Only the consequences of disaster, not depression and fear depended on regular weekly PA sessions.
Participants in regular activity needed more support in terms of negative perception of pain, to distinguish chronic pain from the feeling of discomfort in normal physical movement.
The vision or ability to see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different eye structures with different complexity according to the requirements of the body.
Different structures have different properties, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness. They also require different processing to make sense of incoming data, as well as different numbers to work optimally.
The collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographical area is a population.
When all individuals in a given population are identical to a phenotypic trait, they are defined as monomorphic.
Individuals are polymorphic when they demonstrate several variants of a particular trait.
The colonies of ant soldiers also march and nest at different stages.
In the nomadic phase, soldiers' ants march at night and stop camping during the day.
After the available food has been reduced, the colony approaches the nomadic phase. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these nomadic rebellions or campaigns lasts about 17 days.
The word cell comes from the Latin word “cella” meaning “small room” and was originally created by a microscope that observed the structure of the crust.
The main unit of all living beings is the cell, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and important to the study of life that they are often defined as “the building blocks of life”.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis, sending nerve impulses through the body to maintain the flow of blood and its indissolubleness.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body that it helps protect itself from any potential threats.
The tornado hits a small area compared to other raging storms, but it can destroy everything on its way.
The tornado eradicates trees, tears out boards from buildings, and lifts cars high up in the sky. The fiercest 2% of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms come with winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/sec; 300 miles/h).
For thousands of years, people have been making and using lenses to increase.
However, the first real telescopes in Europe were made in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects look closer and larger.
The greed and egoism will always accompany us and the nature of cooperation is that when the majority wins, in the short term there will always be something else to win if we act selfishly
Our hope is that most people realize that the best long-term solution is to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when people will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some people wonder what is there, others believe that aliens or other life can live on another planet.
But if this happens at all, it's probably not going to happen for a very long time. There are trillions of kilometers between the stars that are \"neighbors\" are so scattered stars.
Perhaps one day your grandchildren will stand at the top of an alien world, wondering about their ancient ancestors?
The bodies of animals consist of many cells. They eat different things and grind them in their stomach. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (although not all; they do not have medus, for example).
They dig underground, swim in the oceans, and fly in the sky.
One cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the living organism.
The cell comes from the Latin word \"cella\", in a translation \"small room\"
If you look under the microscope at living creatures, you will see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw with a microscope small squares in a crust.
He was the first person to observe dead cells.
To move from one state to another and not change the elements and compounds.
Nitrogen in a gaseous state also has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. The composite water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, it has the same molecular structure.
Although its physical state can undergo a change, the chemical is preserved without change.
The weather is all around us and it affects everything we do, but it is difficult to understand it.
Time has been studied by scientists in the field of religion, philosophy and science for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that flow from the future to the present and then the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark the past time yourself by observing recurring events. Cyclic is such an event that happens again and again at regular intervals.
In our time, computers are used to manipulate photos and videos.
Complex animations can be created on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly used in television and movies.
Often music is recorded with complex computers for processing and mixing sounds.
For a long period of time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first settlers of New Zealand were the Maoris who hunted giant birds called moa.
The theory then suggested that the Maori migrated from Polynesia with a large fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriores, establishing a agricultural society.
But new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of māoris from the land that migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own recognizable, peaceful culture.
On the islands of Chatham there was another tribe, the Maori, which migrated far from New Zealand.
They were called Moriories, and there were a couple of puzzles, and finally the moriores were destroyed.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions, while at the same time we can honestly assess the difficulties and even failures.
As we listened to people share their personal, family and organizational stories, we received a valuable understanding of the past and some of the personalities who influenced the culture of the organization.
Understanding history at least helps people get an idea of where they are in the history of the organization, although it does not imply an understanding of culture.
Individuals and all participants discover more deeply the values, mission and driving forces of the organization by evaluating successes and realizing failures.
In this case, what helped people to be open to new changes and new guidelines for the local church was to recall previous cases of entrepreneurial behavior and successes.
Such examples of success have reduced fears of change, while also creating positive tendencies for change in the future.
Convergent thinking models are techniques to solve problems combining a variety of ideas or areas to reach a solution.
Speed, logic and accuracy are the focus of this thinking, as well as the discovery of facts, the re-implementation of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important condition for this way of thinking is that only one answer is correct. It is thought of only two answers, namely faithful or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain standard procedures or such in science.
People with this kind of thinking possess logical thinking, can easily remember patterns, solve tasks, and work on scientific tests.
In reading the thoughts of others, people are by far the most talented species.
This means that we are able to successfully predict the perceptions of other people, their intentions, beliefs, knowledge, or desires.
Understanding the intentions of others is crucial among these abilities. Allows us to resolve possible uncertainties of physical actions.
If you see someone snap a car window, for example, you’ll probably think he’s trying to steal a stranger’s car.
If he had lost his car keys and tried to break his own car, he had to be tried differently.
The MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear-magnetic resonance, discovered in 1930 by Felix Block (Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
The magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit miniature radio signals in this resonance.
Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered in 1970 the basis for the use of magnetic-resonance images as a means of medical diagnostics.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which was the world’s first awarded patent in the area of the IMR.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MRI scanner - for the whole body - which he called \"Unbreakable\"
Asynchronous communication encourages you to take time to think and provokes a reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace as well as control the pace of obtaining information.
In addition, there are fewer time limits with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
By using the Internet and the world network, students have access to information at any time.
At any time of the day, students can also ask the instructors questions and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting until the next live meeting.
The postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from absolutes. There is no good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn. Learning is done through the experience between the student and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all the training TV shows as “do it yourself” and presenting information illustrates this.
Most of us watch a television broadcast informing us about a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never repair a car, make a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to look at ancient ruins or re-model the neighboring home.
Greenland is well connected to 93% of the population, which has access to the Internet, thanks to underwater optical cable connections with Europe and a broadband satellite.
Your hotel or host (if you are staying in a guesthouse or a private home) will probably have wifi or PC with internet connection, and all settlements have internet coffee or some place with public wifi.
As we have said above, although the word “eskimos” remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered offensive by many northern peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada.
Although you can hear the locals of Greenland use the word, foreigners should avoid doing so.
The locals of Greenland in Canada are called “inuits” and in Greenland itself “kalalek” (including “kalalit”), or “greenland”
Crime and bad intentions towards foreigners in general are practically unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no “dangerous places”
Cold weather may be the only real danger that the unprepared will face.
If you go to Greenland during the cold seasons (note that the more you are in the north, the colder it is), it is vital that you wear warm enough clothes.
Many long days in the summer can lead to sleep problems and health problems associated with it.
In the summer, be careful about the Scandinavian mosquitoes. Although they do not carry diseases, they can be irritable.
And while San Francisco's economy is linked to the fact that it is a world-class tourist attraction, this economy is diversified.
The largest sectors of employment are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
The frequent presentation of the city in music, movies, literature and popular culture made it and its sights known all over the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and convention facilities of the highest class.
One of the best places in the country for another Asian cuisine - Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese - is San Francisco.
Traveling to Disneyland is a great tribute to many American families.
A typical visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus trip to a Disney Hotel, a week-long trip without leaving Disney’s property and returning home.
Infinite variations are possible, but that’s what most people mean when they talk about “going to Disney World”.
Many of the tickets sold online through auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day parking tickets.
Although this is a very common practice, Disney forbids it: tickets cannot be transferred.
A permit is required from the province for each camping under the edge of the Grand Canyon.
For the protection of the canyon, permits are limited and can be obtained on the 1st issue of the month, four months in advance.
Such a permit for a closed area shall be granted on 1 January for each starting date in May.
Places for the most popular sites, such as the “Bright Angels” camp close to the “Fantom” ranch, are usually exhausted after requests from the first day after the reservations are opened.
There are a number of permits reserved for incoming requests, which are given to the principle “first came, first served,”
Getting into South Africa by car is an amazing way to get to know the beauty of the entire region, as well as to reach places that are away from the famous tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning, but 4x4 is highly recommended and many locations are only available at a distance between the wheels 4x4.
While planning, keep in mind that while South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are.
Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and depend on the country you come from.
Each country also has its own laws on what emergency products should be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city in western Zimbabwe that is very close to the border with Livingston, Zambia and nearby Botsuana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers many opportunities for a longer stay for both tourists and adventurers.
During the rainy season (November to March) the volume of water will be higher and the waterfalls will be much more impressive.
You will surely get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails curved around the waterfall.
On the other hand, precisely because the volume of water is so large, your view of the actual waterfalls will be darkened by all this water!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the site of the discovery in 1922 by Howard Carter at the nearly intact royal burial of the young king.
Compared to most royal tombs, however, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth a visit, as it is much smaller and poorly decorated.
Anyone who wants to see evidence of the damage to the mummy committed during attempts to get her out of the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The stories of treasures from the tomb were transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
Visitors with a limited stay should spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Rip. This temple was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The dark atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap make the climb of the hill worth it.
Visiting the site can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
The Angkor pass is necessary to enter the temple, so remember to take your passport when heading to Tonle Sap.
Although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize Jerusalem as the capital, it is the capital and largest city of Israel.
The ancient city of the hills of Judah has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.
The city is sacred to the three main religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Because of the religious importance of the city, and in particular of the numerous sights in the Old Town area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.
Along with bustling and crowded shopping centers, cafes and restaurants Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador at international airports or border crossing points.
This letter must meet certain requirements and be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
These requirements are designed to provide an organised migration flow between the two countries.
Citizens of Cuba, who own a green card from the United States, should visit Ecuador’s consulate to get relief from this requirement.
You must have a passport valid for at least 6 months after the date of travel. To prove the duration of your stay, a two-way ticket is required.
The tours are more beneficial for larger groups, so if you travel alone or with just one friend, try to meet other people and gather a group of four to six people for a better price per person.
However, this should not really be beyond your concern, because tourists often move around to fill their cars.
In fact, it seems more like a way to lie to people to think they need to pay more.
This steep mountain, often used for the background of many photos of ruins, rises above the northern end of Machu Picchu.
Most reasonably fit people should succeed in about 45 minutes, although it looks a little scary from below and is steep and difficult to climb.
The stone feet are located along the larger part of the road, and the steeper sections are equipped with parapets of steel cables.
That said, expect to be breathless, and be careful in darker places, especially when wet, as it can quickly become dangerous.
Near the top there is a small cave through which to pass. It is quite low and narrow.
The objects and wildlife of the Galapagos Islands can be seen best by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships with a capacity of 8 to 100 passengers water the waters of Galapagos.
Most people book their place much earlier (as boats are usually full in the midst of the season).
Make sure that the agent you are using is a Galapagos specialist with good knowledge of different ships.
This will ensure that your specific interests and/or limitations are in line with the ship that suits them most.
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the control of the Incas, while the indigenous population of the Araukans (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
The maps are also one of the last independent American local groups not fully absorbed by Spanish-speaking government until Chile’s independence.
Although in 1810, Chile declared independence (in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, which left Spain for several years without a functioning central government), no decisive victory over the Spanish was achieved until 1818.
The Caribbean State, which occupies the eastern half of the island of Spain, which shares with Haiti, is the Dominican Republic (in Spanish: Republic of Dominicana).
Apart from mountain landscapes and white sand beaches, the country is home to the oldest European city in America, now part of Santo Domingo.

Cook Islands have no cities, but they consist of 15 different islands. The main ones are Aytutaki and Rarotonga.
Today, the provision of a luxurious bed and breakfast in developed countries has been raised to a form of art.
After all, accommodation with bed and breakfast is obviously competing mainly on two main things: sleeping and breakfast.
In the best such establishments, respectively, a person can find the most luxurious bed linen, perhaps a hand-made yurgan or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delicacies from the region or the host’s specialties.
The setting can be a historic old building with antique furniture, skillful meadows and a swimming pool.
There is a hidden charm in the inability to get in your own car and take a long journey.
Unlike larger vehicles, you’re probably already familiar with your car’s management and know its limitations.
Stretching a tent in private property or in a city of any scale can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, using your car is a great way to travel, but rarely in itself is a way to “lager”.
Autocamping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or car van with removable seats.
The Golden Age of Steam Railroads and Ocean Liners is inherited by some hotels; before SVII, in the 19th or early 20th century.
The rich and famous currently stayed at these hotels and often ate a nice dinner and enjoyed the nightlife.
Some of their character are also old-fashioned belongings, the lack of the latest conveniences and a certain grace age as well.
While they are usually private property, they sometimes house state and other officials on a visit.
A traveler with lots of money can think about a worldwide flight interrupted by stays at many of these hotels.

These events take place at sites no less than 50 hectares and usually last between three and six months.
There are many different formats of film that have been used over the years. The standard 35 mm film (negative 36 per 24 mm) is the most common of them.
Usually it can be filled relatively easily, in case it is finished. In addition, it gives a resolution, approximately close to the current DSLR.
Some medium-format film cameras use negative in format 6 to 6 cm, more precisely 56 to 56 mm.
This gives a resolution almost four times larger than that of 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
Among the most challenging motives for the photographer is wildlife and it needs a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wild nature is often taken for granted, but just like photography in principle, a picture costs as many as a thousand words.
Photographing wild animals often requires a long teleobjective, although things like flocks of birds or some small creature need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and sometimes in parks they have rules for taking photos for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. It is possible that the environment is cold, hot or hostile in another way.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty-five million or more practitioners.
The written word is often easier to understand than the oral one. This applies especially to addresses that can often not be pronounced understandablely.
Many whole nations have excellent English, and even more so, some limited knowledge can be expected - especially among younger people.
Imagine, if you would like, a mancunian, a Bostonian, a Jamaican and a Sydneyian to sit around a table and have dinner at a restaurant in Toronto.
They share stories from their hometowns, and tell them with their distinctive accents and local jargon.
Usually buying food from supermarkets is the cheapest way to eat. But without cooking options, the choice is limited to ready-made food.
Supermarkets are increasingly deploying more diverse areas for ready-made food. Some even offer a microwave oven or other food heating options.
In some countries or types of shops there is at least one restaurant on the spot, which is often relatively unofficial and at affordable prices.
Make and carry copies of your insurance policy and contact details.
For consultation/authorization and submission of claims, they must show the insurance company’s e-mail address and international telephone numbers.
Keep a copy in your luggage and online (email to you yourself with a attached file, or stored in the cloud).
If you are on your way with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy in your memory or disk (available without internet).
Also give copies of the policy/information to the satellites and relatives or friends at home who wish to help.
The moose (also known as the aggressors) are not aggressive by nature, but will defend themselves if they feel a threat.

Possible long-term effects of excessive drinking on health may include damage to the liver and even blindness and death.
It is possible that illegal spirit drinks contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which causes blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses may cost cheaper in another country, especially in low-income countries where labour costs are lower.
Especially if the insurance covers it, consider not to do an eye exam at home and take the recipe elsewhere to perform.
The frameworks for high-quality brands offered in such areas may have two problems: some may be mints, and real imports may be more expensive than at home.

There are a lot of things to think about before and during your trip somewhere.
When traveling, expect things not to be like home. Maniers, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, language, etc. will differ from those where you live.
This is something you should always remember to avoid disappointment or perhaps even disgust from the local way of working.
Tourist agencies usually offer good travel options and enrich previous experiences related to nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies tend to make most standard reservations, many agents specialize in certain types of travel, budget ranges or destinations.
It is better to work with an agent who often book trips that are similar to yours.
Pay attention to what travel the agent promotes, whether on the website or on the store’s window.
If you want to see the world cheap, because of necessity, because of your lifestyle or as a challenge, there are several ways to do this.

Some cross-border trains carry out checks on the moving train and you must have a valid ID card with you when you board one of these trains.
In night sleeping carriages, the conductor can collect passports so that you do not wake up at night.
An additional requirement for the visa process is registration. In some countries you need to register your presence and address at which you are staying in front of the local authorities.
It may be necessary to fill in a form in the local police or go to immigration services.
In many countries with a similar law, the registration will deal with the local hotels (do not forget to ask).
In other cases, only those who stay outside the accommodation for tourists should register. But this makes the law even more vague, so check in advance.
Architecture as such is for the design and construction of buildings. Often in itself, the architecture in a given place is a tourist attraction.
The view from a tall building or from an intelligently located window can be amazing, as many buildings offer a beautiful view.
Architecture overlaps with other areas, including urban design, construction engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given how remote the Pueblos are, you won’t be able to find an intense nightlife without traveling to Albakurki or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and a few of them offer brand-name entertainment (most notably the big ones that are close to Albakrki and Santa Fe).

On the one hand, in North New Mexico there are serious problems with driving in an unpretentious state, and the concentration of drunk drivers near bars in small cities is high.
Unwanted drawings on the walls or scratches are known as graffiti.
Although far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth vandalism over public and private property, using spray paint.
In modern times, however, there are established artists of graffiti, events related to graffiti and “legal” walls. In this context, graffiti, in this context, often resemble works of art, rather than unreadable labels.
A popular skill many tourists want to acquire is to throw boomerang.
If you want to learn to throw such a boomerang back into your hand, you must necessarily have a boomerang suitable for return.

Due to the constant exposure of local microbes at home, it is very likely that you are already immune to them.
But it is much more likely to face problems in other parts of the world, in which the bacteriological fauna is new to you.
Also, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body in a warmer climate.
Which explains the attacks of Delhi Bell, the Revenge of Montesuma, the curse of Pharaoh and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in a colder climate, intestinal problems in the hot climate are common, and in most cases they are obviously irritable, but not really dangerous.
If this is your first trip to a developing country – or in a new part of the world – do not underestimate the possible cultural shock you may experience.
Very stable and experienced travelers are gripped by the novelties in the journeys in the developing world, where very small cultural adaptations can quickly be accumulated.
To help you acclimatize, think, especially in your early days, about hotel spending, food and services in Western style and quality.
In areas where you do not know the local fauna, avoid sleeping on a mattress or pad on the ground.
Bring a walking bed or hamac to protect you from snakes, scorpions, and others if you intend to camp.

If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to pubs or bars in neighborhoods where you don’t walk often.
For those unknown to the medical jargon, the words “infectious” and “infected” have different meanings.
An infectious disease is caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or other parasites.
An infectious disease is one that is easily transmitted when you are near an infected person.

These requirements may often depend on the countries the traveler has visited or intends to visit.
The abundance of high-quality opportunities for families is one of Charlotte’s strengths, North Carolina.
Residents of other areas often point out a favorable environment for a family as the main reason for their move there, and visitors often find that the city is pleasant to go around with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of easy-to-understand options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are not usually used by families in Charlotte, although they can be useful in certain circumstances.
There is an extra charge for more than two passengers, so this option may be more expensive than necessary.
The Antarctic, which extends around the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Tourist visits are expensive, require good physical shape, can only take place in the summer from November to February and are largely limited to the peninsula, the islands and the sea Ross.
Several thousand employees live here in the summer in about fifty bases, mostly located in these areas; few of them remain in the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desert plateau covered with ice 2-3 km thick.
Accidental specialized air tours go on land, for alpinism or for going to the pole, on which there is a large base.
The route (or highway) of the South Pole is a road from 1600 km from McMardo Station at the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It is compact snow and cracks are filled and marked with flags. Crossing is possible only with specialized reptiles, pulling slats with fuel and commissions.
They're not very frisky, so the trail goes around the Transantarctic Mountains for a long time until it reaches the plateau.
The most common cause of incidents in winter are slippery roads, sidewalks, and especially the feet.
As a minimum, you need shoes with proper soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are inappropriate.
The material should be soft enough at low temperatures, and the hinges deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more.
Some boots have spikes and have additional equipment for sliding conditions, which is suitable for most shoes and boots, for currents or the whole walk with current.
The heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered along roads or paths for better grip.
Avalanches are not an anomaly; steep slopes can retain only a certain amount of snow, and excess volumes are drawn in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that the snow is sticky and it will take some action to lower down, and the snow fall can trigger other events.
Sometimes the initial event, which acts as a trigger, is the solar warming of snow, sometimes additional snowfalls, sometimes other natural phenomena, often caused by man.
The tornado is a rotating column of air with very low pressure, which sucks the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They cause strong winds (often 100 – 200 miles per hour) that can lift heavy objects in the air and carry them in the direction of the tornado movement.
They are formed in the beginning as a function that descends from stormy clouds, and when they touch the earth, they become a tornado.
The providers of virtual private networks (VPN) bypass in an excellent way both political censorship and commercial IP-geofiltration.
They excel web proxy servers for several reasons: They redirect not only http, but all Internet traffic.
They usually offer a wider bandwidth and better service quality. They are encrypted and therefore it is more difficult to spy.
Media companies lie regularly for his purpose, claiming that it is “preventing piracy”.
In fact, regional codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; little by little a copy of a disk will play well on any device where it is original.
The real goal is to give these companies more control over their markets; it is about turning money.
As calls are routed online, where you live or travel you don’t need to use a phone company.
In addition, it is not necessary to get a local number from the community in which you live; you can acquire a satellite internet connection in the wild nature of Chican, Alaska, and choose a number according to which you are in sunny Arizona.
You often have to buy a global number that allows PSTN phones to dial you. For the people who call you, it matters where the number is.
Real-time text translator applications – applications that can automatically translate from one language to another whole segment of text.
Some of the programs in this group can even translate texts into foreign languages on characters or other objects from the real world when the user directs the smartphone to them.
Machine translation improves dramatically and now often gives more or less faithful translation (and less rarely nonsense), but be careful as everything is still possible is wrong.
One of the most famous applications in this category is the Google Translator, which allows you to translate offline after downloading the desired language data.
Using GPS apps to navigate your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you’re out of your country.

These services are often available via a free phone number, with which most phones can connect for free.
Standard photography rules apply to videos, perhaps even more strictly.
If even taking a picture of something is not allowed, you should not even consider recording a video.

Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know other cultures, meet new people, get to know yourself, get a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
This may be a good way to stretch the budget, which would allow for a longer stay somewhere, as for many jobs as volunteers provide room and food, and some pay a small salary.
Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes are still usable. Check if special permits are needed, which can be difficult to get.
The White Sea Channel – the Baltic Sea connects the North Ice Ocean to the Baltic Sea through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mainly through rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is connected to the Volga, so crossing from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
Be sure that once you reach the port, everything will be clear. You will also meet other operators who will share their information with you.

If you want to fly around the world entirely only in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited, as there are no overseas routes.
No airline union covers the intersection points of the three oceans in the Southern Hemisphere (SkyTeam does not cover any of the intersection points).
The Star Alliance, however, covers the entire area except for the eastern part of the South Pacific Ocean – from Santiago de Chile to Taiti, where LATAM Oneworld is flying.
If you want to miss the South Pacific and the west coast of South America, this flight is not the only option.
In 1994, the Armenian ethnic region of Nagorni Karabakh in Azerbaijan began a war against the Azerbaijanis.
A new republic was created with the support of the Armenians. However, no established nation - even Armenia - does not officially recognize it.

The diversity of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differs slightly from the French language spoken in France, although they are similar enough to be mutually understandable.
In particular, the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some minor features other than the French language in France, and the utterance of some words is slightly more special.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss will have studied standard French at school, so they could understand you even if you used the standard French numbering system.
In many places around the world, the wave is a friendly gesture that means “healthy”.
In Malaysia, however, at least among the Malays of rural areas, this means “come here,” like a body-strengthening indicator, a gesture used in some Western countries, and which should only be used for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain may be mistaken for a hand-to-hand shake involving a palm facing the bouncer (not the person to whom he moves) as a gesture for him to return.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages designed to facilitate communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are separate from lingua francs - natural or organic languages that have become, for one reason or another, the dominant means of communication between spoken other languages.
In the heat of the day, travelers can get scents with the illusion of water (or other things).
They can be dangerous if, dusting valuable energy and other water, the traveler pursues the dowry.
Even in the hottest deserts can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real danger if warm clothes are missing.
In the summer, you will need to be careful of mosquitoes if you decide to walk through the tropical forests.
A few seconds with open doors until you enter the vehicle, it is enough for mosquitoes to board the vehicle with you, even if you are driving through the subtropical rain forest.
Bird flu can infect both birds and mammals.
There are fewer than a thousand cases in humans, but some of them were fatal.
Most have included people working with domestic birds, but there is also a small risk to birdwatchers.
The steep fjords and valleys, which unexpectedly give way to a place of high, more or less equal plateau, are typical of Norway.
They often call these plateaus “vidde,” which means wide open space without trees, infinite breadth.
They are commonly referred to as “hee” in Rogaland and Agder, meaning a wasteland without trees often covered with pyrene.
The glaciers are not stable, but descend down the mountain. From this, cracks, clefts, which can be closed by snow bridges.
The roofs and walls of the ice caves can collapse and cracks can close.
Huge blocks loosen on the edge of the glaciers, fall and maybe jump or roll further away from the edge.
The tourist season for mountain stations is usually the most busy during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm in winter, when many mountain stations accumulate with a stable amount of snow and offer activities such as ski and snowboard.
Only a few airlines still offer prices for mourners who are slightly reduced compared to the cost of a trip at the last moment for funerals.
