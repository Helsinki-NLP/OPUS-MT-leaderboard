At this stage of world history, in America there is not one such thing as an independent press. You know this and I know it. There is not one who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, he would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I get my salary regularly to keep my honest opinion out of the newspaper I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks, would find himself out, on the street, looking for some other job. If I allowed my real opinion to appear in only one edition of the newspaper for which I work, I would get fired from work in less than 24 hours. The job of journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie, to slander, to slander, to invest a monster in front of whose feet lies, to sell this country and its people for their daily portion of bread. You know this as well as I know it, and then we do not cure any other innocent journalist. Our talents are our talents, our talents are our talents, and our talents are our talents.
