Welsh parliamentary representatives are concerned that they will \"look like Muppeti\"
Some parliamentary MPs (Assembly Member, AM) shocked the proposal that they might be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentarian MPs from all political spectrum are concerned that they may become a subject of ridicule.
A Labour party parliamentary MP said his group was concerned that the name \"is rhymed with Twp and Pwp\"
For readers outside Wales: on Welsh twp means dumb, and pwp shit.
Parliamentary MP from the ranks of the Wales Party (Vel. Plaid Cymru) said the group was \"not satisfied\" in general, and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was “open” to change its name, but that MWP could quickly turn into Muppet in its speech.
In this context, the Welsh word “w” is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter “u” in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing the law for the introduction of the name change, said: “Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary representatives will be titled will be on them,”
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that met with broad support for the change of the name of the Parliament in the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what will be called MPs in the Parliament, the Committee was inclined to refer to the names of “members of the Welsh Parliament” or MWPs, but the MWP option received the highest support during the public consultation.
Parliamentary MPs propose alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus could bring headaches to Parliament Speaker Elin Jones who is expected to submit a bill on changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the Council operates, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, MPs will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\"
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a re-incorporation of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for changing his name, said he would not accept a referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is a simple price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
They shut the bells of St. Martin while the churches in Harlem fight for survival
“The older people I talked to said that there could have been a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” said Mr. Adams.
“There is no one else today.”
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People hang out in a different way today,” he said.
“Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people stay regularly.”
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and “earlier or later will be found again at the beginning”.
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people will live who will not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so the day will come faster when these churches will completely close because it is unlikely that residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which held worship nearby, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson led by a retailer boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or improving blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but as the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned its rebuilding, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of poor people”.
The expert who played on carillon in July used the second name: \"cultural treasure\" and \"unreplaceable historical instrument\"
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing at the larger carillon in Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of which were brought by the lay leaders of the church, and other episcopal dioceses.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish composed of laymen, wrote to the children in July due to concerns that the children's \"will seek to shift the costs - to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of the construction works sent by the Decease.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the side of the Decease.
The shark injured 13-year-olds while diving for lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he dived with friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call to help, and then drove the group to the scene to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was excitement for the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me.
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone had been torn apart.
“I was afraid that everyone would come out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach at 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct an investigation and safety of customers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the beauty market in UK
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic countertops in the style of department stores and hiring specialized vendors.
As part of a large UK beauty market entry worth 2.8 billion. GBP, which continues to grow compared to the drop in sales on the home clothing and equipment market, larger cosmetic countertops will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if they show up successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use space on shelves that was once intended for televisions, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the supply of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees companies will get more space with areas for certain brands like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its range of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first to open in Croydon last week in southern London and the second to open in Sally Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said outlets would increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist favorable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced outlets Argos into hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because two years ago he bought both chains, claiming to stimulate the sale of live foods and making these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended with a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmacies in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s three years ago for $125 million sold his pharmaceutical business at the 281st Celesia, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy.
He claims Lloyds will have a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and impression of our cosmetics departments to give our customers a more comfortable environment.
We also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at the hands of customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old buying habits.
Peter Jones: Angry after Holly Willoughby quit her $11 million contract
The Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones star left to “dry out of anger” after TV host Holly Willoughby dropped a $11 million contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with the Marks & Spencer and ITV store chain.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand is compared to the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand.
This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones star to cook with rage by withdrawing from a joint profitable job to focus on her own new great deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was “worry” when the gold girl televisiond during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant that there was no longer enough time to devote to their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
The job was compared to the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would have ensured it for the next few decades.
Her decision to step back surprised everyone involved in the job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the entire line.
At the headquarters of the Marlow warehouse is a lot of goods that are ready for sale –
Experts believe that due to the departure of the head of This Morning, one of the UK's most cost-effective stars, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the possible additional delay in starting the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, were close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016, Willoughby founded Truly with Capp, and Jones (52) joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend their holidays together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the head of ITV’s I’m a celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business activities.”
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would get in the paper over comments that some might consider “indecent president” and because he has such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump give so many concessions?”
Trump said, mimicking the voice of news leaders.
“I didn’t give any concessions.”
Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stuck.
More than three months after a June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea’s chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice a “proper reaction” to North Korea’s disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the United States did not lift sanctions aimed at further pressure.
In his speech at the event, Trump took a much more optimistic stance.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We have been threatened by war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – a halt to missile test launches, help free hostages and bring the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people out there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people directly ahead of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were said not to be necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it’s all a little problematic,” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children’s organization is putting together a team to travel to Pal, it’s still not sure that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the Office for National Disasters, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palou to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in efforts to provide assistance.
Given the constant shaking of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared for carrying with the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis are built in Aceh, it is not something that is common in other parts of the coastline.
The lack of sirens for tsunami warning in Palou, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best of times, traveling between a number of Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to take care of earthquake victims is on its way to Pal, but it takes at least three days to reach the scene of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's decayed structure was the basis of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yoko is struggling with a lack of funding, and next year new elections are held.
Joko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting on the streets with swordsmen, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool Player Daniel Sturridge scored a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating the Premier League against Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an add-on from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea goal at a 1:0 score for Chelsea.
He switched the ball to his left leg before kicking her towards the opposite posture.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepai Arrizabalagai, who jumped towards her and entered the net.
“It was hard to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close as possible to the goal, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn’t think too much about it and I just shot.”
Chelsea led at 1:0 in half after the hit of Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue striker passed the ball back to Mate Kovačić during that game before turning around somewhere in half the field and running into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he pointed out a beautiful passing ball that led to Khazarda naked.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot in the net on the opposite rack next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool is playing a club match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton to the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of people killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state disaster office said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that it was reported that a large number of people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that felt on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters high.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of the demolished buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) on suspicion of murder after a woman was fatally stabbed.
The murder investigation was launched after a female body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people from the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I’d like everyone near John Street in Birkenhead to turn to us, and they’ve seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found in Birkenhead and found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who think they know this woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said the process of informing the victim's closest relatives is ongoing.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him that no one can get in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants are now told that it will take several hours until they can return to their apartments.
A police officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He keeps saying, “That’s so terrible.”
At 14:00 in the fenced area were two police vans, and another one was parked directly outside.
A large number of police officers stood within the fenced area and monitored the apartment block.
All who have any information were asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers organisation at 0800 555 111, citing the minutes 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the midst of a debate on “the end of history”.
His persecution would be poetic justice for the almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt \"stupid\" and \"I'm trying to break history\"
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In a debate currently being debated about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of Westminster Palace would become the subject of discussion.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th-century way of thinking and part of the history of a person who many still find worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century rather than today, the defender of parliament from external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Is that a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector are still worthy of honour and celebration...
The killer killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
A man named Yuan was found dead and covered in blood near a stand in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou on Sunday.
The pig breeder was about to vaccinate pigs in a pig on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic test confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilos bit the breeder to death.
The evening news of Guiyang states that a cousin named \"Wu\" said: \"My cousin's legs were bloody and maimed...
Security footage showed Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent it from attacking someone else while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are reportedly negotiating a fee for his death.
Although this rarely happens, attacks on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, the pig attacked her wife and her wife at their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig besieged a Welsh farmer next to a tractor until his wife drove an animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a manitobe farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
“They’re just played.
They're biting, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
All they need to do is show them respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rain to the south-west of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flood rains in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
At 05:00 Eastern time, Rosa was blowing at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is being created above the Pacific and moving towards the West Bank of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to suppress a deep layer of tropical moisture in the north towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low-pressure area will cause severe precipitation to occur in much of the southwest.
In local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous lush floods, muddy torrents and possible landslides in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of rainfalls that will amount to approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible to flood with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunder showers will bring local storm winds and dusty wind.
Approaching low-pressure areas will bring local heavy rains to parts of the coast of southern California.
Rainfalls are possible in a quantity greater than 12 mm, which can cause less mud torrents and landslides.
It will be the first rainfall in the wet season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late in the evening and on Monday early in the morning before they cover the wider area at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the border area of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools down, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at low distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
In most central and eastern U.S. countries, the beginning of October is expected to be as warm as 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks a tense testimony from candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political accounting continued, and the rapporteurs broke the regular program to notify the reversal at the last minute of Friday: a deal reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate court board that she was completely sure that Kavanaugh was in a drunken state touching her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a fervent testimony that he was completely certain that this did not happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people watching the content in the offices.
To make it better for you, it’s about an audience that’s similar in number to that of playing American football or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained large even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded him being yelled at by protesters as he tried by elevator to go to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
For a few minutes, he looked down while live in front of CNN's cameras, the protestors gave him a hug.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to this country?”
They said to him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had released a statement before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were being watched live when the Justice Committee was due to vote to refer Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigates the allegations against the candidates next week, which was demanded by the Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partially convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"playing politics\" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of \"playing politics\" with the future of the UK and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit in a second interview with her in the same issue on the cover, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs duties “complete nonsense”.
The murder of Wade Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Waide Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and detained on charges of police shooting, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS branch.
After the Simpson investigation, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killed him.
A guarantee of $350,000 has been requested.
East Baton Rouge's coroner's office on Friday issued a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound through the neck.
The police department thanks the task force for the fugitives of Louisiana state police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for \"persistentence and search for truth\"
Sims was 20 years old.
A wing player 183 cm tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was \"desperate\" and \"in shock\" for Wade's death.
“That’s what we always worry about,” Wade said.
The volcano throws ash at Mexico City
The ash ejecting the volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
Saturday’s National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of volcanoes located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since the magnitude earthquake of 7.1 rocked central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The conflict between police and Catalan separatists meets the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocated independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined the anti-demonystrations to mark Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists barred by the intervention police began to shoot the cops with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fighting broke out later in the day when the police used the bats to calm the fight.
Over the course of several hours, the groups that advocate independence chanted, “No forgetfulness, no forgiveness,” and the Unionists shouted, “Long lived Spain”.
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, the local press said.
Tensions in the region that seeks independence have not diminished even a year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, which Catalans are celebrating.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, although turnout was small because those who boycotted the vote against secession were mostly boycotted.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent conflicts last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstrations took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcissist Termes (68), an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia will gain independence.
“We’ve had one of the best moments of the year.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a crucial, though narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties are having a hard time holding momentum this year because their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention in which they are awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of police, said the conflict prompted politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has announced to the investigation prison since the end of last year that he will run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
“Candidatement for the European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and repression we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after being hit by a car multiple times in a Londonderry house.
The incident took place on Thursday around 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Insp. Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself was damaged.
It is possible that at some point an arrow was fired at the car from a crossbow.
The Menge hit brought Livingston a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston wins
The new club of the Scottish Premiership League of Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerard to admit his second defeat of eighteen games at the head of the Ibrox stadium.
The Dolly Menge hit proved decisive while Gary Holt's team settled with the Iberian in a second.
Gerard's team is still unbeaten in Premiership guests this season, and next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind which eight points are behind.
Earlier, the Rangers will host the club Rapid Vienna as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his series of wins to six games, and Chief Coach Holt still hasn't had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Missed Opportunities Against Deadly Guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they scored that goal, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole range of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was too slow on his way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only broadly point the ball after he slipped in to intercept Craig Halkett's head against the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests
This is how a key goal was scored.
The Rangers missed out on a free kick, and Livingston designed the opening, with Nolan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Menga, who scored in the middle of the goal.
By that point, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but faced an impenetrable domestic defense, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly had no business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
Allan McGregor's legs of goalkeepers came to Scott Pittman, and Lithgow made a broad blow from another organized attack on Livingston.
Long additions failed to cross the goal line of Livingston, and no two eleven men were awarded – after Hallkett’s confrontation with deputy player Glen Middleton and one for hand-to-hand play.
“Great” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Great game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, thus they continued to exceed expectations on this entry path.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return to major clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hallkett was great at the head of a well-organized defense, and Menga throughout the game did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Vorral to rest.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from standard that set a good game under Gerrard.
They didn't make it to the end, only once they opened a hole in the home team, and it's a kind of call to snap for Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Koeln
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leader of the Tours and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – the goal of which is to repair relations between NATO allies.
They diverged in their opinions on issues involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of the president's supporters came to see him nearby.
And hundreds of opponents of Erdogan -- a large number of Kurds -- voiced their voices by condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him with welcome to the country.
Confronted demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor whom some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others attack as an autocrat.
Deptford Road Clash: Bicyclist Killed in Car Collision
The cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on a road with dense traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place several months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the driver's escape from a crash scene on Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
Police said police officers were trying to identify a man and inform his closest family.
Due to the accident, roads were closed and bus traffic was diverted, and motor vehicles drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a man's prison.
The riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special tornadoes were brought in to combat riots involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were given assistance due to minor injuries to the face.
A prison official said: \"A specially trained prison staff has been hired to solve an incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have been given assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all the responsible will be handed over to the police and that they can spend a long time behind bars –
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager had ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were called to prison to solve a serious situation in which personnel were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with lush floods (potential benefit for dry areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but there is a likelihood that this will happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa passes through the Desert Southwest with the remaining force and threatens to flood.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued alerts on lush floods for Monday and Tuesday in the area of western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities of Phoenix, Flagstuff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is due to approach Phoenix late on Monday with rain and cross over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix said in its tweet that, since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Rocky and the Great Basin, there is a probability of precipitation from 25 to 50 mm, with a possible isolated total of up to 100 mm.
For those outside the threat of lush floods, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a major danger, some of these precipitations could be beneficial because there is currently drought in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. map of dry areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is hit by at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” said Weather.com.
The hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm has hit colder waters of the Pacific and has weakened.
It is therefore expected that on Monday afternoon or evening it will approach the coast of Mexico with the power of a tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and poses a significant risk of flooding.
“The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from Baja California to northwest Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, a possible maximum of 250 mm,” said Weather.com.
Rosa will then head north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then cross Arizona and South Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is very heavy rain in the Baja California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening lush floods and mud streams in the deserts and landslides on the mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton was found injured teenager.
He's hospitalized and in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset police said 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called for everyone who has a recording of the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered evil and anger from the Democratic Party
\"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said at a pre-election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh \"suffering malice and anger - the Democratic side during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and decisively and emotionally dismissed Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegations several decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing about the charge she made.
On Saturday, the president said that “the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.”
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service,” he said in a statement.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nominations as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
I fight for great candidates everywhere.
Trump said it was a mission of Democrats to “create resistance and obstruction”.
A Republican leadership assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise.
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people had died, with a large number of them pulling off the huge waves that hit the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Pal on Friday when at dusk waves up to six meters high hit the coast, dragging many of them to death and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the danger of tsunamis emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t run right away and they were killed,” said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster relief agency at a press conference in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he pulled cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at an open speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people were climbing trees to escape the tsunami and they survived,” he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palou.
Photos from the air released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges and a water-stricken mosque.
The subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the twofold power of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as \"extensive\" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He also said the bodies of some victims were captured under the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palou, in an area called Donggala and which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
“Communications are completely interrupted and we do not have information from Donggal”
“There are more than 300,000 people in this area,” the Red Cross said in a statement adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse,” the statement said.
The agency received a lot of criticism on Saturday for failing to provide information that the tsunami had hit Pal, although officials say the waves came as a warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building panic warning people down on the street about an upcoming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall collapsed on the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communications to be cut off around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the competent military, it began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city airport is only open to humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palou on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia took more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although World Vision staff from Donggala have successfully arrived in the city of Pal, where employees are placed in the yard of their office in Tarpaulin, they have passed out scenes of destruction along the way,” Dosaba said.
\"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses,\" he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched aid wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Pal.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
\"It's still a disaster at the province level,\" said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Okay, it’s a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but such a situation has not yet been declared,’” he said.
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on the Palace on Friday, friends and families of those still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that alleviate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, the rescuers freed a woman who was trapped under the ruins next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
“Given the many years spent paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread to the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitions from Palu that took part in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray clutch instead of two blue clutches.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 in cash at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from Brinck's employees on Friday morning at Newport on the Levee, Newport Police Department said in a statement.
In a statement by Detective Dennis McCarthy, the car driver was empty in a fun complex and prepared to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy doing so, another man “came to the race with Brinco’s employee behind his back” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses have spotted more suspicious people fleeing the theft site, but police have not listed the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change its name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “The living will be officially known as Kanye West”.
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of its eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his hosting on Saturday Night Live, which is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show’s authors said he replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for “emotional reasons”.
In addition to being the short of his current artistic name, West had previously stated that the word had religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It came from Kanya, meaning “the only one – in only Ye – is a reflection of the good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is a reflection of who we are.
He's the one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And one of West's former associates, Jay-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a dash and a line and written in big letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military against citizens
Mexican Presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square that “he will never use an army against the Mexican people”.
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in that square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as left-wing student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those who study and open up a number of free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attract young criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“Since China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it invests in research in the area,” said the investor in artificial intelligence and expert Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in terms of the number of AI innovations by 2030.
“A double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and are looking for the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
\"A double increase in investment could double the chance that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence will take place in the United States,\" Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book: “AI Velesile: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon on an AI system that defeated the best American player of the game Othello, and later served as director of Microsoft’s research department and president of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous tech competitions by the U.S. government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be held next to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that the PhDs in the field of artificial intelligence should be offered automatically to green cards,” he said.
The Chinese State Council announced the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial resources to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations providing financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve partners in the activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment worth $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday to change their country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\" - a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and has blocked Greece from opening accession negotiations to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claiming that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50% needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: \"Are you for NATO and EU membership while accepting an agreement with Greece?\"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because that means safer lives for all of us,” Olivera Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said that no irregularities were reported until 13 hours.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said Gjosa Tanevsky, 62, a voter from Skopje’s capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, joined a referendum on changing the country's name in Strumica on 30 September 2018, which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of parliament in Skopje placed a small stage and received chairs in front of the tents set by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not as servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integrations –
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where unemployment rates exceed 20%.
\"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,\" Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a “positive” result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, which is under the necessary response.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since taking office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and won a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguero made the victory insanely simple, scoring a score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three players of Brighton's defense and then reached the open ground.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opponent players in green t-shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders and then overcame several more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguera, who threw the right-hand digging ball into the right side of the grid and defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some difficulty with his foot,” reports Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.
“We planned to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he got a hit at that moment--
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues a start to the Premier League.
That shot was scored in 29 minutes.
Aguero during this game the ball got deep in Brighton's field.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling towards a tripod.
Sky Blues' attacker put the ball in the net just before sliding into the car.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim in a group game of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable the advancement of Rockyes
Since Nationals players were eliminated from the gameplay, there was not too much reason to insist on a new start.
But she always hopes to win against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of a single game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, get to play.
On Friday night, the Rockies won a 5-2 win over the Nationals at least secured a place in the wild-card gameplay, but they still hope to win their first title.
“Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw away knowing what the atmosphere here in Denver is with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would have witnessed this year.
Why I don’t want to compete in this –
The Nationals still have to announce Sunday's starter, but they are reportedly willing to offer Scherzer to play in that case.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up Thursday in a pitch room and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
This season, the right-wing Washington has achieved a score of 18-7, an average of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds.
Trump to meet in West Virginia
During the speech on the importance of the turnout of Republican voters in the general election, the president always commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge.
“Everything we’ve done will be tested in November.
It's five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the big, big -- I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over in order to take power and control; so they want power and control.
Democrats, as he says, have a mission \"to resist and interfere\"
“You’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “wrong, evil, corrupt and lying”.
He called Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee a name, which sparked a loud outrage from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document--it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen--
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
He does not tolerate personal attitudes.
I wasn't too surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I'm the last in a series of Labour Party MPs told they're not welcome -- all because we said what's on our mind.
According to me, the interlocutor, Joan Ryan, acted similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
On Friday, a meeting of the Labour Party’s Nottingham East party said that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the eight years during which I worked as a local Labour Party representative, the main council meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, in today’s day, a lot of meetings go on in a different tone, and the promise of “kinder, gentler” politics has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as the associates I thought shared similar political opinions began to demand a drastic change of mind and an attitude I would otherwise never agree with - whether it be national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a stream of offensive words on social networks that call my recall, which are denied the policies of the center and are telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I was more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that were addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the avalanche of sexist or racist comments on a daily basis, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is tolerating offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal on mistrust or change of electoral rules, we become an increasingly narrow party.
Many times in the last two years I have been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud and told that everything would be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, prompted by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school’s multi-purpose classroom to decline, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councilman or minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would like to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country grabs towards Brexit, which will negatively affect households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituency, whether it be members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political benefit will deter me from acting as I consider it in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr heading for top
Two late attempts may have somewhat influenced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they have reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated of ten teams.
Finally, superior defense and better exploitation of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in every game so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: “Every honor to Ayru, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
An attempt by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute realized by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to raise the results, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's leadership to the eleventh-century before, at the very half-time, he scored a goal and realized an independent attempt to change the Ayr score to 17:5 on the eve of the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which realized Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then a long break came due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knotto, which they carried on the stretchers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, and this was an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struanhutchinson received a yellow card to bring down the Climate that did not have the ball; from the penalty line, MacPherson performed laying behind Ayre in full swing of penetration.
Climo realized that he had done it almost since the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregory Henry in the fifth attempt by the domestic team.
Star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue work in service activities after it was discovered to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in his favorite BBC series, whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to be shown, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to engage in “a growing restaurant activity in Glasgow”.
\"The sea is ours\": Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes the court will grant it an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a marine center full of cranes in La Paz.
In public buildings, the flag of the color of the ocean was laid out.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with wings: “We have a right to sea.
It is our duty to return it.
In all of Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in favor of Chile during the 19th-century conflict is still alive – just like the longing for the resurgence of the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1st, following a five-year procedure, hopes may be at the highest level in decades.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, is optimisticly awaiting the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians across the country will look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia's view that after decades of demanding negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of a sovereign exit to the sea to Bolivia.
Here's Morales, Bolivia's charismatic autochthonous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from a verdict on Monday.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia’s favor and that little would change if so.
The U.N.-based body in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final hearings means that the case “was not complex,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting the interests of Bolivia, the last four years may have taken them back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been adopted by the current Bolivian leadership,” Zárate said.
Morales's wartime rhetoric has buried every good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has made an unusually quick decision.
Monday, Bolivia will bring “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement with each other,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s favorite presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“A judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't take place if it can't trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm nuclearly if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be inclined to restart diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, which comes more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said the sanctions continued because of \"desperate fantasies\" and that the U.S.'s opposition to the end of the Korean war would not throw the North on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to support the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to give up the arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal That The Last Line Of Big Head Covers Is On The Road To Luxury Trade In Your Neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely hide the sun, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion runway presented a line of unspoiled huge head covers for their spring and summer collection 2019 and impressed fans of style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer have been swept by Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention to the runway.
The example that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it was a large beige hat decorated with a wide-ranging feather-like perimeter that took over the model's head.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than pieces of high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a breather and a mask, and the other looked like a cornette with melted ice cream.
If you follow a great fashion saying – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury shops in your neighborhood.
Huge hats perfectly fit the heels of La Bomba – a straw hat with a perimeter of about 60 cm wide that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the extremely impractical hat that conquered the social media on the fashion runway sent another big creation – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia and white leather lunch, was an exhibition copy in the summer collection Jacques' La Riviera for 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of the famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told the FYROM: “I expect big beach hats and bags in luxury shops for the next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories –
John Edward: The Language Skills People Need
Scotland’s independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, and additional weights give individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement said school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes into his heart.
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot only use English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year’s final exams show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by independent school students.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent rating for Mandarin language, while 72% of students studying German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of Spanish learners also received the highest possible grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey found that 17% of employers could not fill jobs due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for preparing young people for careers.
Because more and more jobs require language knowledge, and skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choices, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives it an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in 2013 involving more than 4,000 adults, 75% of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to be able to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of respondents, more precisely 15% of them.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will opt for languages that are thought to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are professional in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools provide children with an environment where learners will prepare and arm themselves with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future is preparing for us.
It cannot be ignored that today’s global business knowledge of language is very important for the future of each country, so it must also reflect on education.
Therefore, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien just faire.
John Edward is the head of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools
LeBron will be playing in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego for the first time
Fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don't know how many minutes they're going to play.
“More than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton told Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudrell tweeted that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training early this week, James answered questions about his plans for the season in Lakers, which consists of six games.
“At this stage of my career, I really don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign of numerous meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five planned meetings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does this evening’s Trump meeting start in West Virginia and how can you look at it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump meeting in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidates who have sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain an advantage for the November elections.
Therefore, Trump’s presidential campaign headquarters report that five meetings scheduled for next week aim to “stimulate volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Most in Congress is so important for the president’s plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a tumultuous campaign,” Trump campaign’s anonymous spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally to be held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, winning more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to help him improve the ranking in polls,” political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Leaves Heart on the Field Before Individual Offshoots on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, breaking couples on Sunday afternoon might be exactly what was supposed to reverse the Ryder Cup.
“The wheel of happiness is turning – a saying that is especially true in sport and in which athletes believe, especially in competitions such as this.
To whom is the wheel of happiness favored now?
“They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is on our side right now,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europeans are ahead with four points, while there are still 12 points left until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouraged him to play alongside Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after a day of play.
Spieth played killerly from teen to green and could serve as an example to others.
The cheery celebrations were getting louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, and everything culminated in the key road to which Spieth came to an unsolved result.
After winning the game with 15 holes, there was a similar cheerleading url in which hope and faith could be recognized that Americans could turn everything around.
“You just need to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
These players are all that's left.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a sensation of the Ryder Cup.
A European odd but irresistible couple has a maximum number of points and can’t go wrong.
“Molliwood is the only couple who didn’t lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also avoided a bokey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as a back ninja on Friday morning.
This winning series, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria show that they are just the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of Europeans as the sun sets over the Parisian Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Norren and Sergio Garcia, who had a great performance in this morning's couple game.
One Bogey and two double Godeys on the first nine holes on the playground buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole from which they could not dig up.
However, there will be no one on Sunday who will help individuals dig out of their own hole.
It’s fascinating to watch close-up games because you can see the player’s interactions in a pair, hear the tips they give and those they don’t give, as well as study a strategy that can change at a time.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the U.S. team has the necessary combat, which some, especially the Statesides, suspected.
Europeans enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a lead of 10:6
Europeans after Saturday's games in pairs on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the United States of America of 10-6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led with four points of distinction on Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European team, in an effort to win a trophy that ran away from her in Hazeltine two years ago, was superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs, scoring a score of three to one.
The U.S. team showed greater combat in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the trophy, Jim Furyk teams need to score eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinari, known as \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in pairs in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourballs, they proved to be superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods, who did not show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some genius moves, but now has 19 defeats of 29 games in Fourballs and Couples and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused for the morning Fourballs to return with his partner, Henry Stanson, to a match with the couple and suffered a 2&1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third best player.
But the Europeans didn’t exactly go all lubricated during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, setting the ladder high for their American team.
They first defeated Spanishman Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter by 2&1 in Fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy by 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of the Ryder Cup team, which was behind four points, managed to return to individual games, although Furyko's team only needed a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, the Sunday counterattack seems to be hard for them.
North Korea says there is “no chance” of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions are increasing mistrust in the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” for example stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled a nuclear test station and made a decision to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
“However, we have not received a satisfactory reaction from the United States,” he added.
“If we do not have confidence in the United States, we do not have faith in our national security. Under such circumstances, there is no way we will be able to disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea's famous complaints against Washington's \"procedural\" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would gradually lift sanctions, his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim made a promise to work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump assured North Korea’s security.
North Korea wants to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction of strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists that denuclearization be carried out before that and increases pressure by means of sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, and even opposes “the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri added.
“The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just the delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust.
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting of Kim and Trump, which the US president spoke about at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in held three meetings in the last five months and added: “If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Prime Minister Ri's speech was greatly different from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a \"man rocket\" on a suicidal mission.
Trump, who threatened “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim in the United Nations for his courage to disarm, but added that many more jobs are ahead of him and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearization and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia have expressed their view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verifiable denuclearization takes place.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for the nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after a few hours for “gangster demands”.
North Korea has scheduled a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile location and nuclear complex that will take place if the United States takes “proper measures”.
He added that Kim revealed to him that these “proper measures” relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course where they learn how to rest well
The new course at Harvard University allowed all students to get a good night’s sleep in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep science professor at Harvard University of Medicine and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a course that he thinks is the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea of the course came after he gave a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I find out this only now, at the last year of college?”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Medical Service Paul Barreira says the University decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom where students need to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how sleep deprivation affects success and how important the sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn that a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is shown that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride for all-night learning before the exam still exists, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps fight obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course to the entire campus.
As the next step, he plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study course before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic devices screens, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the Dolly Menge hit the missing defense of Steven Gerrard and ended the match with Livingston's 1-0 win.
The Ibrox team wanted to win the first win in the run-up to the triumph in February and the 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team is now behind eight points in Ladbrokes Premiership behind the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to be left uninspired and did not seem to equal the result.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed third with only one event of difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after Line Judge Calum Spence suffered a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the flanks, and so ran past Ayre to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same setting of Livingston that took the measure of Hearts last week and would be delighted that his well-designed line-up had stifled every attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston has achieved more with it.
They had the chance to make an event two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game by Scott Pittman opening the space to head for Allan McGregor's goal, however, the midfielder missed the opportunity.
The deep free kick of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Hallkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only forward an imprecise blow to the rear lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have given him an 11-minute trial in 15 minutes after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not comply with the Colombian request.
In the first half, the Rangers were able to direct only two balls to the goal, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had one blow to Lassan Coulibaly's head and the pytomies of Ovie Ejaria's blow were not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute playoff of Livingston slowed down the game, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers again failed to use the deep Jacobs return ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Nolan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who retained his privacy and chose Menga for the simple end of the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had an immediate effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long shot after the other.
Holt's side could have extended leadership in the closing moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide fly from the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, was looking for an eleven-year-old once again because he had a crush on Jacobs, but Thomson looked away this time.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
And now follows a page from our Almanac on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago...the day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
As early as that time, Geiger's counter became the main stronghold of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film \"Bells of Colorado\" in which the main roles appeared to be by the seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to the radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: “Look at that, that’s what you hear.”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells and destroy them.
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure involves extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
The cells are treated so they can “recognize” protein that is common to many cancers and then re-inject into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting cells from the immune system from the patient, changing them to the laboratory to know how to “recognize” a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer,” explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells from the immune system from the patient and their “learning” how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after hosting Saturday Night Live, took part in discussions about Trump and supported him, wearing a cap with the inscription “Let’s Make America Great Again”.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was scouted during a Saturday Night Live show after a break-up show praising U.S. President Donald Trump and announcing he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap with the inscription “Let’s Make America Great Again” he continued to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often and they say to me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the U.S. Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford’s claims of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, a recording of West's speech on social media was broadcast by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if the announcement of Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to the audience that he was being thrown behind the stage for the hat he was wearing.
“I was being harassed behind the stage.
They said, \"Don't go anywhere with that hat.\"
I've been mistreated!
They said I sank,” Washington Examiner reported.
West continued: “You want to see the bottom,” and said that he would wear his Superman cloak because that means I can’t tell him what to do. You want the world to progress?
Try it with love.
Varianty wrote that his comments caused at least twice the public’s dismay, and members of Saturday Night Live’s show seemed disgraced, while one person told the magazine: “The whole studio was silent.”
West was called at the last minute as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
By performing the song “I Love It”, West was dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, astonishing many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: “One of the people with the most courageous spirit: Thank you for resisting the Mafia.”
Karen Hunter tweeted: “West was simply its own and it was absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing, or supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he “will now be officially known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased music legend Prince changed her name to symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted knife murder at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder of a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Star of the series Game of Thrones Kit Harington revolves around toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow who handles a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But a 31-year-old actor turned to the macho hero stereotype, saying that for such television roles, boys often feel that they have to be strong in order to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague, Rose Leslie, of the Game of Thrones series, admitted that he wanted to “very decisively” face this problem.
“I feel very determined at this point – where we were wrong with our masculinity – he asked.
“What we taught men as they grew up, compared to the problem we are now seeing.”
Keith believes television, thanks to very masculine characters on screens, could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught through TV and on the streets, and that boys feel that they must have these certain traits of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our age – how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys –
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not record the sequels to the Game of Thrones series after her end of next summer and said that he had \"completed with the battlefields and horses\"
As of November, Keith will be starring in a new performance by True West by Sam Shepherd, a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently found out that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that had happened to him while filming the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife by filming that series, which gave me my family and my future life,” he said.
Rose, in a fantastic series that won the Emmy Award, played the role of Ygritte, the love of Keith's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases of disease
China said the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of infection are transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted across some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said the person who is infected with HIV in this way was almost absent.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is high.
Researchers estimate that, due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of an effort to deal with this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV drugs in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public staff has provided data on the GOP senators, calling it “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”.
U.S. MP Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had released personal data to three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia's website.
The Los Angeles Democratic Representative assures that these claims spread to individuals “ultra-right wing” as well as websites.
“Flying, lying, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication of this data belongs to the Waters office, as well as information about the employee’s representative, The Hill reported.
“These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false,” she continued.
“My staff member – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false allegations – is not responsible for the leak.
These unfounded statements are completely false and absolutely false.
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleicher wrote.
“This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and calm.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to criticisms by Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who were accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing against Waters in the general election, also tweeted.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had informed “the authorities and the authorities of the order” of these false claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet,” she continued.
Review of the film “Johnny English: Back on task” – insufficiently interesting Rowan Atkinson fights spies
It is now common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is the same in the new screening of the action series “Johnny English” whose first sequel titled “Johnny English” was first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens called “Johnny English Rides Again” in 2011.
Will a twisted satire of our own about how obviously worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
The inept Johnny English with his eyes and rubber face again has permission to complicate the situation, while his name more than anything tells him that it is a comical creation for a broad audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to “diluted” glamor reminds of Inspector Clouseau, has a dash of Mr Bean’s character and somewhat resembles that guy who sang one note of the opening song “Chariots of Fire” at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character is also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man whom Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the embodiment of chaos.
There are one or two great moments in this latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English got close to a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the piper briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that “serious” film titles such as “007” and “impossible missions” themselves offer elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults. In my opinion, the crazy stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as those of Atkinson's silent gigs embodied in Mr Bean's character.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a generally accepted fact.
Hacker has entered the UK’s secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of all British agents, to the terror of an agent in office, which is unfortunately a short appearance played by Kevin Eldon.
This poured out a glass of prime minister's patience, superior and warlike character who experiences a complete collapse of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully show the character who should represent Theresa May, but she did not get the material to do something with.
Intelligence consultants have revealed to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person will be careless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as the principal of a classy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few handsome Georges here because English teaches rock-style spying.
English is quickly brought to the government’s premises for an emergency meeting, where she meets again with Bowe, her former partner, and her eternal sacrifice, played by Ben Miller.
Bowe is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so, two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who do everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal wife Ophelija Bulletova, embodied by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems, an evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and funny events: disguised as waiters by burning a classy French restaurant, they cause a huge mess by smuggling into Voltina’s luxury yacht, and English challenges a complete anarchy by trying to use headphones for virtual reality to find out what the interior of Volta’s house looks like.
Everything was done right for this last sequel, but however attractive and ostentatious the film is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a central achievement.
And as with other films about Johnny English, I asked myself again whether the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
Labour Party Rejects Plan to Make Brits Work Four Days a Week and Get Paid in Five Days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan according to which the British would work four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on to workers the savings achieved by the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could \"integrate\" into the party's economic programme and plans to favour the country's interests of workers.
The trade union congress has supported the shift to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“The four-day working week will not take place overnight, but it is a tendency that fits in with the approach that this party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of this party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this aspiration.
A Labour party spokesman said: \"The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.\"
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take power from the hands of “unspoiled directors” and “profiter” in utility companies.
Chancellor's plans in the shadows also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their overall role because the Labour government could make \"rejections\" based on the observed irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the company's board of directors and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of private company capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk for “60 Minutes” about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and questioned whether the agency's conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley, 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would reveal something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I think, of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said going to the debate, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they were brought out, and I said, \"Did you do it?\"
He was determined, unshakable, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, as if it were carved into a stone.
“I’m determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really need a strong accusation to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denied everything decisively,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think anything has changed.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending the world’s poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Power Project project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing to the world’s leader, telephone calls, or any other meaningful ways of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen considering that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to call for action, or just another case of so-called “cliktivism” – where people feel that by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet they really change something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters who sought to achieve a range of different goals.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of more than $37 billion that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the “The Power of Nutrition” partnership of investors and contractors in the UK who advocate “help children develop to their full potential” with the promise that after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda to end malnutrition in the area.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition is only a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Foundation “The Power of Nutrition” at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website, which reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we will fail.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights movements and anti-apartheid movements before us, because we are stronger together.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belong to some of the performances at this year's New York event that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a “blockade” to prevent Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington can, “if necessary” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinkke said.
Zinke said Russia's engagement in Syria -- especially where it acts on a call from the legitimate government -- is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
\"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of sea routes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,\" he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at an event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which in the United States is portrayed as “the voice of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuel,” he said, and Russia is “serviced with the same trick” in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made simultaneously with the Trump administration's intention to increase exports of its ingested natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2) pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “container” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply fueled by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position sparked a reaction from Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would \"seriously consider\" running for president after midterm elections.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she was considering running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman in charge,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren voiced her opinion about President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying “this country is heading in the wrong direction”.
“I am terribly concerned that Donald Trump is doing our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't think it should run in 2020.
According to a study by the University of Suffolk/ Boston Globe’s Center for Political Research, fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor David Patrick's candidacy, with 38% voting for a potential bid and 48% against it.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed over the 2020 presidential race were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Trak Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after signing up for September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident that took place on Monday night.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through after he returns, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers return with,” Trump said in a press conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that he said about both his son and other war veterans “returning a little differently, returning hard, returning, wondering if he had respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other military members, gave to this country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, obstructing reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department of Wasille.
18 states and D.C. support review of new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 federal states and districts filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v Sessions lawsuit, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner \"and violent members of his gang\" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014 that allowed immigrants who do not have documents to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"ignors decades of state, federal and international law\"
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be settled on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court’s friend’s report said.
Lawyers further argued that a policy denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “ensure the necessary workforce”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Azil is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palou as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly difficult.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusum’s 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palou.
“Emergency vehicles deliver bodies every minute.
The government lacks clean water
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were cramped.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fracture in the back and shoulders, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palou, where patients were treated outdoors for continuous severe subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
“I think I was bent inside the ruins of the wall,” Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “maltretizing” through “propaganda ads”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper released a four-page long ad in the U.S. daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid addition in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6th U.S. congressional election, which China denies.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described in a Reuters statement as a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the beginning of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, China's main exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
In a Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstadt states that “China now doubles this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American free speech and free press tradition by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstadt wrote.
“In contrast, you’ll find limited voices of opposition on the Beijing street newsroom and you won’t see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China’s disturbing economic path because the media is under tight pressure from the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that \"one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish - his article, although he did not say what the newspaper was about.
Kavanaugh's debacle Republicans have removed voters ahead of mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans stand with Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and defend him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were quite a stir, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their vote.
Such things cannot be returned,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University College of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake's last insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November,” said Karina Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang: “The November is coming,” protesting in the Senate corridor as the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee were preparing to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be beyond all expectations,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be even taller, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t go to elections –
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by Supreme Court judges, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans continue to confirm it.
“It’s a real mess for the Big Old Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
“It’s not just a vote on the committee or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was sent to a reserve bench, but also the way Republicans approached it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Prioritys Group, a group that helps in the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after witnessing Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined to him.
A new survey released by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truthfulness of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh safely or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court judge's candidate showed her his genitals at a party during a study at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops based on Berners-Lee’s open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose a place to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt's \"world domination\"
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own \"personal network data storage\" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, obligations lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision on who can access what information is fully user-friendly.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data”.
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce’s CEO, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they will make a complete change in which all of their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded a consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as it launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the First World War Priests of Victoria's Cross
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received Britain's greatest military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that “the stone will be revealed exactly 100 years after the work of his grandfather for whom he has received this recognition.”
According to a report by London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across St. Quentin's Canal \"through a very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and the machine gunners\"
Later, he rushed into the front row and with “an incredible courage,” leading the unit forward before chasing the Polish cannon without anyone’s help and slaughtering three of them from the military squad.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's work was \"something I know I could never achieve, which incites humility\"
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he \"feels very honored to participate in the parade\" and added that \"the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give\"
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellar 206, and instead they got Piglet Peppa
Imagine this – stay up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so you can eventually be prevented from following the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were shown live at night on channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as George Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in the UK remained in shock when the transmission interrupted Piglet Peppa.
Many were not impressed at all after they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning only because of the struggle.
A fan of child cartoon transmission on Twitter described it as a “some kind of sick joke”.
“According to state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6am, so they had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
“Jupi, ?Pearl of Peppa??”
Bellator president Scott Cocker said he would align his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
“When I consider re-imposing, I think we can probably work something out,” Cocker said.
“But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday comes, when they will be there on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many correspondences that weren't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it's a state-of-the-art problem.
I can promise you next time it won't come to that.
We're gonna keep five fights instead of six, which we usually do, and we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've outdone it.
These are unfortunate circumstances.
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt \"inferior\" about sexuality
The Olympic Jumper in Water, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
A twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he was unaware that “not everyone is like me”.
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to the disease.
Appearing as a renegade in Laverna's first show, Daley said he felt \"less valuable\" during his growing-up than others because \"it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls\"
He said, “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity over others were the real things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that “someone and something” was so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal has become a prominent person who advocates for LGBT people and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to have fallen in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you’re so young,” he said, referring to his first Olympic games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, “he said it was hard to find someone in the same years and experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been about ‘I have to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had got tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be here long enough to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand while he was breathing out, and only after he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – to jump in front of the local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also an inspiration for choosing the first song , “Proud ,” singer Heather Small , which echoed in it during preparation for the Olympic Games , and which she is always the heaviest .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to fully regain his form to avoid an awkward turnaround.
Mickelson, who has played a record 12th time in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench on Saturday with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it was often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering up and developing his game at the exercise in the hope of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding field of Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain routinely punishes imprecise blows.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who won all four matches with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man more than that and could not say.
“He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“There’s a lot of self-confidence.”
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I had no idea he was playing two games.
I imagined there were more of them, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's how we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence also brought certain intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for it,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game.
European Captain Thomas Björn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Björn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant race.
Danac debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, where Captain Seve Ballesteros' team had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141⁄2 to 131-2.
“You are constantly recalling that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference,” said Björn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team that won the score 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led the result 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will play with full power.
Go out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing is over until the floor is advertised on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
All the time I talk, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are certainly aware who is standing opposite us – the biggest players in the world –
Rejoiced by the performance of his players on the hard golf course, Björn added: “I would never run before oro in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow are the main individual shows, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with your partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as an individual, they're at the final exam of your golf players' abilities.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, and she's going to have to give the best of herself tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate, because he has to give the best of himself.
Unlike Björn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their teammates, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those big turns last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed “a miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that swing goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
Accordingly, we organized our setup and set up the boys as if, you know, we would try to perform magic tomorrow.
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I have decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it includes everything,” Björn said of selected players for individual matches.
German new warship put on hold
The latest frigate of the German Navy was due to be launched in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but will not be ready until next year due to faulty systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” the leading ship of the brand-new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy as early as 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, there will be a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the port of origin.
However, constant delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships – which are said to allow Germany to show power abroad – will become obsolete by the time it enters service, Die Zeit notes.
An unfortunate F125 frigate arrived on all fronts last year, when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key \"software and hardware flaws\" that would make the warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
The software disadvantages were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – half as small as the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it has been shown that the ship is dramatically too heavy to reduce its efficiency and restricts the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Committee of the German Defence Parliament, admitted that the Navy was actually “ running out of ships capable of deploying”.
The official said that the problem increased over time, as the old ships were placed out of operation, and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation is listening to the secret life of bats
New research carried out at the Scottish Highlands estate aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared and river bats in the Gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile checks using manual detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of vote of bats and what kind it does.
Then a map of habitats and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal what areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as creating meadows and how to best maintain forest surfaces for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and works on decorations that affect shelters and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flies and certain chemical treatments of building material, and pet cats attacks.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten bats inhabiting Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
“We have a huge space for bats here,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there is much more that we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and on other facilities will help us to better understand what they need for progress –
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance works within buildings, since the unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young people, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's Bat Protection Association, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don’t know how their population progresses.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape brought against him as “fake news,” saying that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published those charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In a live video posted on Instagram for 142 million followers hours after the indictment was reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man, and everything’s fine,” added the footballer with a smile.
Ronald’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have called “unacceptable reporting on privacy concerns.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most severe violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at an apartment in a hotel and a casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly analized her, according to documents filed at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after an alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent” a “good guy” who was let down by that “one percent”.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was agreed.
Mayorga also claimed she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was “feared of retaliation” and worried that she would be “publicly humiliated”.
A thirty-four-year-old said she now wants to undo the deal because she is still traumatised by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a 100m-euro transition.
Brexit: UK “will regret forever” losing car manufacturers
The UK will “repent forever” if after Brexit it loses its world leader status in car production, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was \"disturbing\" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
Japan’s automaker said the impact of waiting at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The drive, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“It is my view that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, we will experience production failures at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal over possible consequences for cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer refers to the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement reached.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the “on time” principle – where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars running on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota at its Derbyshire factory could not hold more supplies than it needed in a day, said the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the Chequers plan, which offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU, was “precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
“We have to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“Evidences not only toyote, but also other manufacturers show that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful range of supply chains.”
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Union of Unite, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never return.”
A government spokesman says: “We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU –
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “delay for another week” as the fight for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s involvement in elections, links between Trump’s associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire a deputy state attorney, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been spreading rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing wires to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of announcing he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he \"wouldn't like\" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judicial Committee hearing that witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into lawsuits against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week, taking into account everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists would dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not a result of a “theatral behavior” of television reporters, although she said, “I will not object to the fact that they are distracted.”
She then suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is organizing more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him,” she said, adding without any evidence: “We have analyzed the numbers,” she said.
A brief address will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the US president, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make that possible often, and you could see that in the last few weeks, and it is precisely that you can talk to the president of the United States that will replace short speeches to journalists –
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guest officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York City, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performances in front of assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers working at National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to the EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude and a desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already pledged to settle the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued, which are moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Members from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here –
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers, Chrission Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat by Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31 – 27, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee's chief coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the playground line and he just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put him on a stretcher and sent him on further tests.
A representative of Tennessee State State State State State State State State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had gone out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no “details about the type/range of the injury” and that Tennessee State was trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five knocks before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 knockouts in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK – and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters to promises to provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increase will be charged by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional tax , which is charged to the current tax, including an increase introduced two years ago to other homes and real estate purchased for the purpose of issuing , may be up to three percent.
The treasury expects the move to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are buying residents who do not have a UK residence, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become ghost towns, due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the country, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on price-friendly real estate to repair “the shame of the housing situation” in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposal for a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of nothing-provoked actions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
“Last year, I said I would dedicate my mandate to the restoration of the British dream – that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes easily as well as valuable British.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the shame of homelessness is still very real.
Jack Ross: “It’s my ultimate ambition to run Scotland.”
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his “extreme ambition” is one day to become the manager of Scotland.
The Scottish (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Lights after leading St. Mirren again last season at the Scottish Football Championships.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, this opportunity could only be achieved if I were successful in managing the club.
Ross' predecessors at the manager's office include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Cania.
Former Allo Athletica chief says he didn’t feel scared because he inherited such famous names at such a large club, after he had previously refused calls at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at this point will be measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I probably would only consider myself successful if I could take the club there again.”
Ross only completes the third year of his managerial career, following a period during which he served as Assistant Chief in Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloy recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren off the verge of falling out to the winner of the title of next season's champions.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” Alloe recalled.
“I really believed that managing is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, made a solid profit, and enjoyed quite successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure of work, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I have always wanted to manage, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I have ever felt in my life –

The perfect time for a pinta is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a survey.
The summer heat wave increased revenues to British pubs who struggled with finances, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data show that pubs and bars achieved an increase in revenues in July by 2.7 percent, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of good weather and the participation of England in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues rose by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being even more affected.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have achieved much greater profits under the same conditions as the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served have also been killed by heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed breweries and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food sales fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for rest and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling in the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although a drop in sales of 4.8% per year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for the leaders of the restaurants where food is served, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give us a much needed rest –
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, in July was 2.7 percent, reflecting a slowdown in brand share growth.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring system for the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and established industrial reference value.
One in five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Instas” pages
The news exacerbated the fear of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account showing their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Instas” accounts – references to the photo-sharing website.
The news has increased fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a clean-up “main” account to show their parents, while having private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged other words, “Raise Me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11-18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to owning private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be \"the voice of an athlete\" on the Scottish Athlete Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athlete Committee as the non-executive director of the Annual Assembly of the Administrative Authority.
Doyle is Scotland's most distinguished athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
\"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the board,\" Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I want to be the voice of an athlete and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Games, of his total of four Olympic golds, and is now a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischemic attack he could no longer walk.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he fully recovered, learned to walk again and today for agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement –
Shared opinions on online advertising for a traitor comparing mothers with cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advertisement that compares mothers who breastfeed their children to the cows that are muse-incited by the shared opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be “the world’s first silent carrier traitor,” Elvie’s consumer technology company released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music whose lyrics read: “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see any tail,” and “In case you haven’t noticed, this isn’t vim, it’s my breasts.”
Then comes the refrain: “Blow it, pump it, feed it, pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it up to your lady’s husband.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it sheds light on the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children steal from them a few days after birth.
Elvie Discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
The other person comments: “Understandingly traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies -
Someone added: “A total shit commercial.”
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song was “funny” to her.
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
Giving up milk made me feel just like a cow.
Advertise is a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
“This is a great product,” she said.
The other person commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at milk-producing moms (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and they feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who issue milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and is discretely fit into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, keep their babies, and even get out during the issue.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “Ellvie’s publisher is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between the depiction of women and cows we wanted to put into the center of attention the betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that the traitor Elvie has reached the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to compromise their ability to stay in the country by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of arrests had not been recorded in criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household in the country are illegal, and most of them are criminal strangers.
So we continue to search for these individuals,” said Mr Albence.
According to the statements of the workers of the shelter, in order to carry out proceedings for children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was the standard earlier.
Many will appear by videoconferencing, not personally, in order to bring their case before the immigration court for obtaining legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be quickly deported.
According to workers in the shelter and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Proponents said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child will struggle to overlook.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish \"occupation forces\" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that \"according to this, they will be treated\"
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” the congregation said.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have run out of homes.
He said Damascus would continue \"the fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories were cleansed - from terrorist groups and \"any illegal presence of foreigners\"
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed “some Western countries” for “the spread of irrational fears” that prompted refugees not to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue,” he said.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with the support of Russia on a province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had \"clear deadlines\" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, \"that will be eradicated\"
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to form a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the work of the committee should be limited \"to the revision of the articles of the current constitution\" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win second term
Under this logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the recall and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be \"the most dramatic finale of the presidency\"
There are no signs of viewer fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on strike terms, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed viewing with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news broadcast evenings.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s drama “Designed Survivor” about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Shooting Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers taxi rides in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why,” she asked.
He replied, “Because she makes me laugh,” said Mrs. Covell.
There is a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law resulting from the Roe v Wade proceedings, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turning it off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used the “deep background” sources for his book, “Fear” on Paul Manafort’s $15,000 Noah’s Leather Jacket (“a garment full of bravado,”” writes the Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, of Mr. Trump’s anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I will never look at Super Maria again.
“Part of what he makes you see him as a reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “The pawnshop” about the rotating cast and the daily plots of Trump’s show (fight with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because you're going to be left behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai was sunny at a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watching MSNBC and simultaneously recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging over.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” said Mr. Fleiss.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money on the outside is poured into the most uncertain mid-term election race for congress
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a cash flood, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recently renovated district of the suburban part of Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conor Lamb, who won the post last spring in the second district in a special election.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally reduced in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a fight to fund a campaign between the main party fund collectors, the Committee that raises funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a broadly followed special March election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
The position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts gave little advantage to Democrats.
The U.S. needs to punish El Salvador for supporting China and then withdraw
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to call on U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Heather Nauert said.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was considered progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus actually suspended any consideration of the fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following could be a report by special investigator Robert Mueller on a possible Trump obstruction of the judiciary, which now has very significant publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller, according to reports, also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If a majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to step forward again to the voters, and perhaps ultimately to the jury of his equal.
There is a lot of quiet – if – and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s inevitable fall is – or those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike Hitler, only to have the West oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacres that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that he had secretly proposed filming the president last year and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
\"How will we respond if a recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?\"
And above all, will we vote in the midterm election for Congress, which Mr. Trump will hold accountable?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep for a long winter's sleep.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once served in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the sabbath candles on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how not to be optimistic about our future -

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapido from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel, would put them in a strong position to qualify from the G European League.
Knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season to a 2--2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent,” said the 31-year-old.
“We got into the game believing that we could accomplish something and we pulled a point.
Maybe we could have stolen the game in the end, but, in general, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better at the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let’s hope we can continue, leave last season behind and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the Nationwide study respondents said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance, Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how to take care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay those costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance hybrid policy with a monetary value that will help you cover those costs or self-securing with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Engage healthcare professionals to identify a reliable person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also consider giving authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in hand.
Man shot multiple times from Ilfracombe air rifle
A man was shot multiple times by an air rifle as he returned home after his night out.
The victim, in her forties, was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a “accidental act”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were cut off, aid officials could not get any information from the Donggala province, an area north of Palou that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a county that stretches over 300 km of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal regions of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit Western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jay region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the 2004 destruction of a deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wassilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by a state police officer in Alaska.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and is held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded guilty to “innocent, of course,” the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he could be in jail for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B offense, which is fined one day in prison and fines of $200.
It's not the first time any criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, has called on police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed following an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and in the coming days the number of people killed is expected to increase.
The earthquake struck close to central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palou when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspect in New York City terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he beheaded pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted a serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury of Saipov struck a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in organized crime cases, and allegations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and premeditation,” the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried him out as “disgust, cruel and corrupt”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaewic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erri, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca,” the announcement reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last tried the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of the Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 on an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were \"obviously disappointed\" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage has pledged to \"mobilize the People's Army\" during a protest at a Conservative Conference.
The former head of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said politicians had to \"feel pressure\" on Eurosceptics, as one of the members of parliament Theresa May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham processions that the United Kingdom would \"come out\" so far - that Mr. Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in the reconciliation of her deeply divided ranks is emphasized by the Tories prone to a stay that joins a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan \"Chequers\" amid Brexit supporters, supporters of the rest and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue to try to make an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction, and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone told the “Leave Means Leave” campaign in Solihill that he wanted to “reject Chequers”.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers”.
In his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bonne has rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely incorrect.”
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Yankees was also in the procession, addressing the press with the words: \"I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please drop Chequers and start listening “
In a prominent statement, Mrs May added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises”.
Farage told the crowd that politicians must “feel pressure” if they are about to fail the 2016 referendum decision.
“It is now a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘it won’t work out for you.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We mobilize the national army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A crowd of activists waved to the banners \"Torys against Brexit\" after the group launched this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
“These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canada Plus plan for an unhindered state of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “seriously consider” running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would \"seriously consider running for president\" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at a direct social gathering with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Republican Geoffrey Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been at the center of speculation for some time to stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
She was asked if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman in charge.
Arrested for killing LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatal outcome of basketball players at Louisiana State University (LSU) Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying a man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
“Waide Sims got a bullet wound to his head and eventually died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wade interfered to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and owned a weapon and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and detained at East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year student with 198 cm tall who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in 10 first sets last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion title after order ensures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order “will play a big role in the race”.
From the start, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and urged Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton on the market at the start, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered boxing one round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after an action wheel on a wheel that left Ferrari reluctantly in danger of falling behind after a double move in the defense of the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the back row and was seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran a large part of the race while relying on his tyres to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally reached boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Waltheri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he's a real gentleman for letting me through.
“The team did a really great job of making a formative finish,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release a letter to Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and nasty and dishonest”.
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at publishing and leaking information to the public, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn’t do it.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public - ‘Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t let her story out,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it secret and kept it secret, which she asked for.”
However, her denial did not come upon the approval of the president, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: “Let me tell you something – it was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidates, whom three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use these charges for their own ends.
“They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see evil, abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control – the words are the president.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5 ? 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made amends for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5-3.
In the early minutes, the Giants came up with an advantage of two goals with the blows of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the domestics to equalization, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back into the lead.
François Bouchard was equal to Dundee before two naked Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured a victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's team, who came out of the background and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season of the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead by hitting Beauvilier four minutes later.
In the busy opening of the game, Sullivan returned the home team to play at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Markquardt allowed Cownie to equate at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The locals were re-grouped, and Bouchard once again led them to equalization in the goal force measurement at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of the victory when his team had already been halfway to win the last third of the game.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, hosted teams from Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on plane escape earthquake
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died while ensuring a safe flight of hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after a major earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which rocked heavily.
It remained to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air on Flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart is broken because of it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to Donggali, Siggy and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of deaths is still increasing, as many bodies are still under the ruins, and many could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching height and up to six meters destroyed the Pale, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency vehicles deliver bodies every minute.
There is a lack of clean water.
There are small shops everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is after survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse.
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is being run off as missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which owns a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man is being driven missing, after it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they could not trace one of the passengers from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in attempts to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land in the airport of Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a traveler from America, said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to get through the water that had reached their waists to the exit in the event of the danger of a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and yelled, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working nearby to repair the dock also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in the accident of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them have been involved in Air Niugini.
The analyst exposes a weather survey of the night in which a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor's office ended the case in a retrial on Saturday, a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used his cell phone information to agree on the move of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data with several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, which contradicts his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at a time when, according to his own claims, he was with a friend named Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he \"spoiled because his truck was in Nashville.\"
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chamber's death, deleted her messages, phone calls and contact details.
\"He wiped her out of his life,\" Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Aware of Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude towards the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop music has distanced itself from its beginnings filled with political messages and a reflection on social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fuguees and Commons are re-born in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York Babysitter sues couple for cancellation after ‘racist’ messages
New York Babysitter sues a couple for being discriminated against after receiving a misdirected message from a mother calling her \"another black woman\"
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the charge to “out of surprise”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when, upon her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she found out that she was the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
“NEEEE another black woman,” said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an \"unpleasant\" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, as she claimed, because their former nanny, who was an African-American, had been doing her job badly, and that she had been expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and asking for $350 a day compensation for a six-month period for which she was originally hired, though without a contract.
“I want to show them that I can’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they were racists, saying that the end of Maurice's employment was reasonable, because of fear that they would not be able to trust her after an insult.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco said that his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and that “it is in a very difficult situation”.
“You’re going to sue someone who’s in that situation.
\"That's not very nice,\" added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Puddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter revealed.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before publishing.
It’s very fun what we now know about Paddington’s enormous success.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before the little stuffed bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Puddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of the family,” she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a boaster,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was perceived as some achievement of his own child: you are proud of him, even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was seen that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit exclusively to Puddington.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried their best to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad and to believe he wasn’t going to get away with it,” said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, \"Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be joining you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart working slowly lost its effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and then it all went out.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside me.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who was already saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengers - who were not aware of the temptations she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I put my head down, and the tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Messages from women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who are left without loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a brilliant career.
“Everyone remembers him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy.
Before his death, however, he left his job because he was in “really dark condition”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after you took her life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with an idea with cards – so people would know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even if he’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed, or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the very bottom – when the children opened the presents, did not look them in the eye or wanted anything else –
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: “All this leaves a great cavity in the family.
She's making us.
But we'll keep going and fight--

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on end as FBI launches investigation
“I thought we might be able to enter a little unity if we could really get something like what he was looking for, a time and scope-limited investigation,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would ‘divelop’ amid the rooted party blockade.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their involuntaryness is driven by the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will arrive in just five weeks, on November 6th, if, as expected, Republicans do not go well, then they will be severely weakened in attempts to lead the wanted man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is calling on senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The Senate will vote, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to break the ruling vote and confirm his position at the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of 'descending' runs under Kim
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the U.N. ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 escapes last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are stricter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more charges that traffickers charge people.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of the North's breakaways eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people are fleeing China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often forced to return them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are still technical in the war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang at talks that focused on halted denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions on not making any progress since.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not take into account that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysteric” as unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate \"hysteric\" and said he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if I ever acted like that, I would call the woman ‘hysteric’,” Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him \"grotesque and coordinated blackening\" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work, because he showed prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if he would try to recall Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi has rescinded.
“I’ll say the next, if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only capable of being in the Supreme Court, but not in the court in which he’s now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeals in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Law on affordable care or the law on abortion resulting from Roe v. Wade's proceedings, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings for confirmation, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, anger that has been coming together for months and years can’t get rid of all this without wages.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
\"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be the CEO and who said she was crying when she got angry, but she developed the technique that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.\"
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great--
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs, in the office dominated by men, is that, once when I cried because of the inexpressible anger, an older woman, the cold manager I was always a little afraid of, dragged me to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they've hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-designed decision,” she told me through laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
Someone called them “Snow White and Seven Dwarfs”.
As the campaign was already a long way off, it fell behind in raising funds and vowed not to enter the race if it did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount,” she asked.
While she was saying that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism – that she had a sore throat.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder’s reaction to the media.
\"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.\"
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my tombstone.
\"She cried--
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The start of the trade war between the United States and China has resonated loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week has emerged with new tariffs that have affected $200 billion ($150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has in some ways reciprocated, and a tariff of five to ten percent has recently been imposed on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to hit the US with a blow, and the world’s second-largest economy will not surrender soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by accommodating demands, but public obedience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war can provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for starting economic collapse in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thinking who focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is “ready” to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals to help rebuild a country that has been destroyed by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be able to help rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 – 10.5 on the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again while Danish captain Thomas Björn's team scored 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during almost the entire tournament, sent a ball to the 16th hole in the water at the first blow, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds and has become one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordana Spieth was expelled by Thorbjörn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of the Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop tears today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy I won the cup again.
It’s all up to the team. I’m happy to be able to help,” said Garcia, full of emotions after the European victory.
He transferred the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in individual games on Sunday, 2&1.
“I feel incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, is just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US captain Jim Furyk said: \"I'm proud of these guys, they fought--
At some point, we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get over it, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup board, so we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to take your hat off for the people.
We're outplayed--
New data on red tide: concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Commission on the conservation of fish and the plant and animal world of Florida (FWC) shows a general decrease in red tide concentration in the areas of the Gulf of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, the conditions of heterogenic flowering of algae are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier , which indicates a decrease in concentration.
The red tide stretches about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Flowering areas can be found about 10 miles from Hillsborough County coastline, but in smaller places than last week.
The red tide was also spotted in Pasco County.
In the past week, average concentrations have been recorded in the Pinellas district or in the associated offal area, low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough district, common to high concentrations in the Manatee district, common to high concentrations in Sarasota district or associated offal, common to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations in Lee County or associated off-road area, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Air system irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
