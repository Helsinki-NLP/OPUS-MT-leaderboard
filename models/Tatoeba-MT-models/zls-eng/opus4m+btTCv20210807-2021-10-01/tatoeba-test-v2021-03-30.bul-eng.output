Let's hope so.
He looked back at me and got arrested.
Go get ready to go to bed.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is covered with leather.

Wet clothes stick to the body.
I'm pretty busy.

This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.

I'll get a job.
Do I have a right to accompany you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They get along well with their neighbors.
Didn't Tom say anything about that?
French is not so hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to you.
No one else offered to help.
Get your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What goals?
If we stopped trying to be happy, we'd have a pretty good time.

What else is in your pocket?
There was no other place to go.
The man pushed her away.
A hug from you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We waited with little expectation.

What is the point of coming in time if everyone else is late?
The wind was blowing rain right in my face.
I want eternal life.

The station is downtown.
Don't even bother coming.
Both are unpredictable and impatient.
So do I.
I don't like the way you behave.
What are we doing here?
The object is beyond the direction of this investigation.
You sat in my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You need to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?

Now that I've registered, what do I have to do?
It is clear that Americans cannot solve even their own problems, so how do they imagine that they are capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a guel.
From now on, I will study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
Yesterday was so cold.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
We were out of our mind.
I think you'll stay happy.

I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What will the weather be tomorrow?
Are there any children?
Don't open those windows.

Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk. He's writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.

He was here at the time.
I put on my shoes right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father’s presence.

Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not so bad.

Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes look good on you.
I studied French for three years.
I think you need to get out now.
Please, go away.

I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
Make sure you turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you'd better do something about this life.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor is slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say that to your parents.
Let's say things honestly!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land is Tom's.

Do not add annotations.
He's not here yet.
Your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He played well on the guitar.
Have you played Minecraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you currently taking any medications?

I heard every word he said to you.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit, I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We were going to drive.
Can I get your coat?
My dad's gonna make me a delicious meal tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just shut the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come and see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom's not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept taking pictures.
There are fewer and fewer teenagers working today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very beautiful, but it's readable.

Is your wife a blonde or is she a brunette?
I'm out, I'm taking my bike.
The men carried the boy to the hospital.
They spoke too quickly to find out what they were saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera Tom took the photos with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I gotta go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given an opportunity.
Would you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be right here.
I don't like the trees.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's kind of weird.
Can you do it yourself?
In the spring, the days become longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father sing in the bathroom.
English is spoken in Singapore.
I eat bread.
That request was rejected.
You were right.
He was tired and still went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are tired.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played to win.
What's in the coffee?
The pear is burned.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I will always remember your kindness.
This smell and I felt it again.
Everybody's dying.
I didn't get it.
Give me a hammer.
He hates to shop.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary is a literary worm.
I think you're capable of anything.

I don't think we should do that.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than it should be.
This is a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go for fish.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice as big as Japan.
Either you or them!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hanger by the door.
Tom lives three blocks off the coast.
He's a little celebrity.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn’t as fun as the book.
The job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole called by us Universe - a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task should be to get rid of this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so as to embrace all living beings and nature in all and beauty.
He will undoubtedly come.
I know it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this form in French?

I don't know who he is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became director.
We're studying French.

What is this thing?
Never give dog food to your cat.

Ask again later.
He's my big brother.

She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you about \"stupid.\"
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that pisses me off.
Both Tom’s parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Is Tom away from here?
The bad weather didn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.
My hair's out on my feet.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and take a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to find out when Tom's about to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but no one thinks about changing themselves.
She wants a divorce.
You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
I heard shots.
I didn't mean to put you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate that for?

Are you finished with breakfast?
I have a few old computers.

Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom, and Mary took out their weapons.

You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak in French.
I'd like a blouse that fits this jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
You always complain.
The milk is soaked.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We need to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your connection to him?
The devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother said he wasn't afraid of the dark.
I really hate Tom.
The problem was I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let’s talk about your future seriously.
I have a few calls to make, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple went on a journey around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one home, and I was abandoned all day.
Mathematics is my favorite subject.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom came back to get his coat.

Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put your robe on.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
Yesterday became a terrible accident.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste your time.
Why did you come so early?
If you're judging by your wonderful complexion, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It'll probably snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura may have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom might object.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was an art museum in this area before.

Sooner or later his luck will end.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.

And not a word to anyone about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in the city.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived on the train yesterday afternoon.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Choose your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you sushi.

What is Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.

I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the mail to send a letter.
Look at the map on the wall.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
I've lost form.
Get me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight on the road and when you pass the traffic lights, you're there.
Do as you wish.
Some people would certainly ask, why don't we just get together and get out of Afghanistan?
Wake up your socks, please.

I'd like to have a photo of you.
Please, pick it up.

Have you seen Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy for me.
I haven't talked to Tom in three weeks.
Stop sneezing.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you're wrong.
He didn’t stay up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think he asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have an intolerance to travel by sea.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.

I heard footsteps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a sheet.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else is done.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night the game was exciting.
Wide jackets are the last pee of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little good will on both sides, our problems should be solved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbs the stairs.
The house we used to live in was destroyed.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
Prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Take me off this side of the traffic lights, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why aren't you laughing?

I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me this list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is married and we want to make our heads straight.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you gonna eat that cookie?
I worked hard in the last month.
I knew he would accept.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This may seem a little burdensome.

Something was taken.
Green is Alice's suit.

I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, if you like.
“Where do you live?” – I live in Tokyo
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not only a necessity, but also a pleasure.
We have to be careful.
It's already eleven.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was your last weekend, Nancy?
Do you learn French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a deodorant.
When I face you, the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to take part in this.
You don't seem too surprised.
This is a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us fast?
Let's get our sakes.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing speaking French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You have nice hands.
People are generally against war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
That's never gonna end.
Tom taught me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Which tooth hurts?
We learn French.
What makes you think so?
You're sitting in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
I study French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom looks lonely.
Let me tell you something about me.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than to listen, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you finish it?
My dad often takes me to baseball matches.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn’t speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He hasn't known anything about it since he left for America.
I'm gonna have to deal with this now.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He became a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister recently?
They're all hungry.
She came down the stairs.
I was alone, I was learning.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Get me something to eat.
If you haven’t paid due to an inconsistency, please send the due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet here.
I'm on vacation here.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being addressed.
Tom was rescued by an accidental passerby.
The town is in the center of the city.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
Very kind of you to step out of your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of town Mary lives in.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both statements are correct.
I've never seen a blackout before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep tonight.
The round lasted about five minutes.
He was going around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.

It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, but what remains to be said.
I'll do my best.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me far from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the best friends of the girl.
When he was young, his parents died, which is why he was raised by his uncle.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I will follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arrangements.
What a wonderful time!
Do not waste your youth, otherwise you will regret it.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
Acquiring English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how it works.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. Kott's Japanese food began to like him.
I put the money in the safe.
We're on our way.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You have to point to this fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom teaches me how to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find an account.
I'm sure Tom knows French enough to be okay.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary is Tom's big sister.
I don't know one or the other guy.
Guests should start arriving soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
I enjoyed it so much!
This isn't your house.
I haven't seen anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruits rot under the sun.
I'm always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes in the control.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take a while.
I thought you might turn away.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Be careful. There's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take it with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes away from here by train.
What is Tom trying to do?
Can anyone believe you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we better get out of here.
Tom said it probably won't take long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, let's keep it quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I learned French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.

We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we're interested in Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom is twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two girlfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have an infection on your gum.
He started writing a novel.
He is satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you'll be able to catch your train.
You won't need this anymore.
Put it back where you got it from.
Let's get started.
I fucked you.
Tom found out that Mary was stealing money from the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Is that how stupid you have me?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, it's probably worth it.
This is Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What is the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision about this today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you learn French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's he eating, Ken?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we will be studying at college.
