Members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that “they look like mules”
Some of the members of the Assembly are bewitched by the proposal to change their title to “CUP” (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Wells Parliament.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may become an excuse for ridicule.
One of the Labours said his group was concerned that the new name was “referred with Tup and Udlb”.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group “is not happy” and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party indicated that his group “was not prejudiced” to the change of the name, but noted that the new name of the CUP (in English – MWP) had a certain verbal resemblance to “muppet”.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshirean pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up the draft drawing, by which to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision on all the descriptive names with which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves,”
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published a public consultation on the proposals setting out a broad support for the Assembly to start being called the “Paralement of Wales”.
As for the position of its members, the Commission prefers “the Members of the Wales Parliament,” in short, but the “CUP” option has received the greatest support after an inquiry into society.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft draft draft draft draft for up to a few weeks.
The Reform Law will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they reach a debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\"
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called “Macedonia”.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name of the state, said he would not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Cambani Shut Up Against the Difficulty of the Churches in Harlem
“If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today both are gone.”
Adams says the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People today socialize in different ways,” he added.
“Bars are no longer the quarterly daily, where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he expressed his concern that the money from the sale of assets will not reach for as long as the leaders expect, \"and sooner or later they will be in the same situation.\"
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people live who do not help to survive the other shrines of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built by white flocks before Harlem became a neighborhood of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin – a decade later.
The original white methodist flock was exported in the years after 1930.
Then the building became the property of black residents of the neighborhood.
“St. Martin” was taken by black Christians under the direction of St. John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, as they did not want to hire black officials.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's enormities had drawn up a plan for her restoration, where the bells were ordered.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of St. Martin, proudly calls them “the poor bells”.
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural treasure” and “unreplaceable historical instrument”.
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ngu of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first system of bells in the world to be used by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriweder said that St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been played out in St. Martin’s in the last few weeks has been a complex tale intertwined by architects and performers, some brought by world leaders of the church, and others by the bishopric.
From the newsroom, which is the governing body of the congregation consisting of world leaders, they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese “would be inclined to transfer the costs of the newsroom – although it had no role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Child Injured by Sharks in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while diving for cabinets in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beikan Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and embarked on a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had caught a closet and was excited, and then realized how he was screaming, “He bit me!
He bit me.
Haml said that when he reached the boy, he realized that the whole area of his keyhole had been torn apart.
“I called on everyone to get out of the water because there is a shark,” he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was taken into critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a media briefing that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier in the water, but it was estimated that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles adds that the victim has suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
From the authorities responsible, they have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours from safety concerns while the investigation runs.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not pose a threat to humans.
Sainsbury plans to launch an offensive on the UK market for beauty products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams, opening up beauty stands in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of a significant offensive in the UK’s beauty market, which is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are declining, the largest beauty stand will be located in 11 stores all over the country, after which, with the success of the initiative, similar ones will be found in more sites.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the racks until recently occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of products available up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to the offers at Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-releases its boutique range of make-up so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly being sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Creiden, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food daily in comfortable moments leads to supermarkets having to make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, chief executive of Sainsbury, said the sites would look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl dismounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury has had Argos facilities in hundreds of stores, as well as opening Habitats’ sites since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company says has increased food sales and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to re-fascinate its beauty and pharmaceutical products has been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company’s facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281-seat pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
They say Lloyds will have a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the trading director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the type and character of our beauty stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands offered by us aims to respond to every taste and all necessary in a captivating setting with a convenient location, making this combination an attractive destination for beauty products that challenges the concept of the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones: Angry after Holly Wilby's refusal to settle for £11 million
The Dragons star, Peter Jones, got angry after TV lead Holly Wilby gave up a $11 million deal with his Lifestyle Company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wilby has no time for the brand household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of “This Morning” announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Wilbby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones “to boil” after withdrawing from their lucrative brand-name brand-name products for the last minute – focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when the “golden girl” on television admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to £1.5 million – meant there would be no more time for his brand of household products and accessories.
The business is similar to Guinet Poltrow's Goop brand, with rumors saying it has doubled Willbbi's fortune, which is estimated to be £11 million.
When the 37-year-old Wilby announced on Instagram her departure from Truly, Jones left the UK on a plane to head for one of her vacation properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Its decision to leave the brew absolutely all unprepared.
No one thought this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There is a warehouse at the Marlow headquarters that is full of waiting to sell products.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the UK’s leading star this morning could cost the company millions due to a large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a slowdown in the brand’s launch.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Wilby herself founded Truly along with Cap in 2016, like Jones, who was 52, joined as president of the company in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Wilby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will also replace Ann McParlin as the lead of the show “I’m a celebrity” on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Tough negotiations leading to “feeling in relations”
He joked about the criticisms he would take from the news channels about making a comment that someone would consider “unsuitable to the president” and as too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his jokety “journalist” way.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as a “big step towards removing North Korea’s nuclear weapons”.
But negotiations to remove this weapon are on hold.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Jung Ho told representatives of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea “does not see a reciprocal attitude – from the United States to its country’s first steps on the way of disarmament.”
Instead, the diplomat noted that the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful,” he said.
“We were going to war with this country.
Millions of people were killed.
Instead, we are looking forward to a wonderful relationship.
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results – ending missile tests, freeing hostages and returning home to the bodies of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his non-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded area, we’d have about 200 people right there,” Trump said.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia has devastated the island and led to the death of hundreds.
After the Lombok earthquake of foreign NGOs, it was said that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it is unequivocal that international aid is not required, which makes things slightly challenging,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While “Save the children,” I am putting together a team to go to Pal, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, said the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in Acheh in the case of tsunamis, they are not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu has likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate even more this logistics.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days before he can reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has transformed Indonesia’s remaining infrastructure into the centre of his campaign by investing a large amount of money in roads and railway lines.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joko is heading out again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Daniel Sturridge Brings Late Equality to Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sterridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute this Saturday at the Stanford Bridge in London.
Sterridge received a submission from Gerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was 1-0 behind.
He placed the ball on his left leg, then made a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty field and directed to the upper right corner of the network.
She transferred the planner Kepa Arisabalaga and knit inconsistently into the net.
“I’ve tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shak are always looking for forwards so I just tried to get as much time as possible for a good shot at the door,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Cante, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of his Belgian star, Eden Azar.
The attacker of the \"blues\" filed with Matteo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kovačič exchanged a quick double submission in the center.
He then released a fast-paced pass with which he brought Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar outruns the defenders and marks his left leg in the far corner of Liverpool's Doorkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the Champions League group stage at 3:00 this Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising to 832.
The number of people killed after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, which hit the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, news conference spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported.
The city of Palu with more than 380,000 people is besieged by ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Berkenhead this morning.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from the stabling of Grayson Miuse on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking for assistance from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I urge all who were close to John Street in Berkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have shot something with their dashboard cameras, to contact us as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Berkenhead and that she was found in a private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived at the scene and inquired where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that it is currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mouse tried to get back to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man was silent when he found out about what had happened.
Residents are told that it will take hours until they are allowed to return.
One of the police officers told a man that the entire area was treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
She keeps saying, \"That's so terrible.\"
At 2 p.m., two police baths passed through the cordon, while another van stayed outside.
There are police officers in the Cordon who are watching the apartment block.
All available information is denied to contact @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue has become the latest memory hit by \"rewriting history\"
Its ban would be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
Al - Cromwell's Society - described Mr. Crick's proposal as \"crazy\" and \"an attempt to rewrite history\"
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Cromwell’s Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on removing statues of Oliver Cromwell to Westminster Palace to become a goal.
The iconocracy of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent presentation of Sir William Hamo Tornicroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the mid-17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the resulting division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve fame and honor.
Killer pig wound deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near the cobblestone market of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was prepared to inject its pigs with vaccines in May 30, 2005 in Sinin from Qinhai Province, China.
He is expected to have arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also welded the door to the neighboring cognac open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody zurla in the bone.
Medical expertise has confirmed that a 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s feet were bloodied and disfigured,” said cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera record shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in order not to attack anyone else while police were collecting evidence from the crime scene.
It was also reported that Yuan’s family and market leadership negotiate compensation for the death.
Although rare, it has been reported before about pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, after the attack, the man suffered critical injuries.
Ten years before that, a 650-pound pig had chained a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife was able to chase him.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not usually aggressive, but the taste of the blood could act as a trigger.
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they have no intention of hurting someone.
But one must also treat them with respect - the man ends.
Hurricane Rosa Will Lead to Rainfall in the South-West United States
According to weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
The rose includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane estimated at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning east time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific, a synchronous is forming, which is moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
In the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synchronous will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, bear debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible to have flash floods under rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It will be extremely unreasonable to travel a handful in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to raised dust and pushy winds.
The approaching synchronous will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach precipitation of over half an inch, which will lead to bearable small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the season.
On the late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on the late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations to the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There is a nearly 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to prevail.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Bret Kavanau hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the attractive sight of the testimony of the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanau and Christine Blacey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
During this time, political opposition continued, with the networks disrupting their regular reverse programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kavanau had pressed her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanau, in his lack of emotional testimony, is absolutely certain that such a thing has not happened.
It is likely that even more than the number of 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen to have watched the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate available data on other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally experienced difficulties measuring the number of people who watch from their jobs.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football match or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leading supporters strongly supported Kavanau's appointment, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's play.
After a statement came out of the office of a moderate Republican that he would vote in support of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him playing protesters while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes, he did not lift his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here, I’m standing in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he is presenting the truth to the state?
“You have power, while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Flake replied that he had already come out of his office with a statement, and before closing the elevator doors, he said he would make an additional decision during the hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided live coverage a few hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the full Senate vote.
Al-Flake said he would only do this if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which Democrats have insisted on in opposition.
Flake was partially convinced by talks with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Queens and a few Senators, Flex made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes for Kavanau's approval without an investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanau.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “political games” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in \"political games\" with Britain's future and in undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the newspaper, her previous foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up her attack on her so-called “Game of the Lady” plan for Brexit, proposing that UK customs fees be collected for the EU and vice versa is “completely absurd”.
Wade Sims: Police arrest suspect Dietian Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police reporting that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the site and also found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS WAFB's branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shot against Wade.
Its warranty is set at $350,000, the Advocate said.
East Baton Rouge's judicial medicine office released a preliminary report on Friday, citing a gunshot wound that affected the head and neck as a cause of death.
The administration expressed its gratitude to the Luisian State Police, the police crime lab, the Southern University police and the locals for the assistance it provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for “temporary justice”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-high and 6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
On average in the last season, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets per game.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “destroyed” and “in shock” after Wade’s death.
Wade said, “This is something that worries a person all the time.”
Volcano spills ash over Mexico City
Exploited from the volcano Popocatepetel ash reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater increased and in the last 24 hours there were 183 emissions of gas and ash.
The center has observed numerous tremors and tremors.
Posted in social media photos show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of the capital since an earthquake with magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting independence clashed with the gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote to secede.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to resent the guardians of peace with eggs and paint powder, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually mumbled by tourists.
Later in the day, other clashes with the police occurred, and the police resorted to their thumbs to master the situation.
For hours supporting independence, the groups were shouting, “We do not forget, we do not forgive,” while the country’s leaders responded with “Spain forever”.
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical attention for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the desirable independence region even a year after a referendum was held on October 1st was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in voting sections in the region with a number of violent clashes.
The demanding independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to pass on a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a standstill,” the man added.
Despite this important victory, whether it’s a small difference, in the last December’s regional elections, Catalonia’s independence supporters experience difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed captivity, or are arrested in anticipation of a trial due to their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a police-backed protest on his phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
His comment is that \"it's getting more and more tense\"
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders awaiting a preliminary trial last year, said he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the repression of democratic values and the repressions we observe by the Spanish government.”
Londoners: Arrested men after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderi several times.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has announced that he has suffered damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with an arbalette.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won
The Novice in the Premier League of Livingston surprised Rangers and inflicted only a second loss to Stephen Gerard in his first 18 games as club manager from the \"Aybrox\"
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team ranked second in the Hibernion ranking.
Gerard's team remained unbeaten on foreign ground in the Premier League this season, and the following Sunday faced the Harts leader, who was behind eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston is already in a series of six games without losing the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since he changed the position Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Missed Good Opportunities Against the Immaculate Guests
Holt's team had to lead the score long before scoring a goal, and his direct style of play was extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his blow went off, after Alan Littgow shot at the beam after Craig Hallkett returned the ball with his head on it.
The hosts let Rangers play the ball, knowing that it could seriously make it difficult for guests from static situations.
That’s how we got to the goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, with Deacon Gallagher and Robinson combining each other and bringing Menga out who led the ball and scored from the middle of the criminal field.
Until now, Rangers ruled the ball more, but faced the unbreakable protection of the hosts, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' goalkeeper saved Scott Pittman with his foot shot, and a hit with his head crossed the door after another static position for Livingston.
In the criminal field of Livingston, however, there were centers that were easily cleared, and the judge of twice did not respect the claims of the guests for the doppelganger – first after the unity between the Halket and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then in doubt about the game with his hand.
“Phenomental” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A great game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays just superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not undergo changes after the team returned to the Premier League, but Holt deserved a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Hallcat was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under strain.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard’s guidance, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were much below these standards.
They missed the last pass before goal, with only once able to tear down the protection of the hosts - this loss should wake Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship has cooled due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s EU accession.
Then Erdogan set out to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police prevented a 25-thousand-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters who wanted to see their president flocked around.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom the Kurds, also voiced, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect a breakdown caused by one visitor, who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Deptford Road Accident: Cycling Rests After Car Collision
The rider died after a car crash in London.
The disaster took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but the cyclist died in place.
The disaster happened months after another rider died after being hit by a fugitive driver on Childers Street, close to a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
The police said their employees were working to identify the man and would then inform his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are diverted, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Oversights Injured in Trouble
Six prison guards were injured in a high-security uprising in a male prison, the prison office said.
The raid broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at nearly 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to control it, special officers from the Tordano team were called in, who would have to deal with eight deprived of their liberty, with the interference itself limited to one wing of prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to the face and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison office made the following statement: “A specially trained staff are called to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we state very clearly that the persons responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended.
Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack on a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the riot fighting units were called to prison, where they could master a heavy disturbance in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dry areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that Arizona is hit by a tropical storm, but there is a high probability that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is carried through the desert in the southwest, leading to a risk of lightning flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the late Monday it could bring rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center provide 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogolone Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of precipitation possible in individual places.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rose may actually be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwestern part is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Ages Monitoring Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second-largest category, reports Weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to land on the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which can still boast at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
This is why it is expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of upcoming rainfall.
“Complete rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, which are possible up to 10 inches,” reports Weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's limit on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely severe rain in Baha California, northwest Sonora and the desert south-west of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and carry various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain terrains.
Midsamer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where its condition remains “stable”.
At night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, police said.
The police are asking everyone who may have taken pictures of what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanau has “suffered by the derision and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Kavanau is a voice that rejects the devious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanau was “suffered by the derision and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanau testified to Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blacey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the trial.
The president made a statement on Saturday that “today the American people have witnessed Kavanau’s intelligence, courage and qualities.
“Every voice in support of Judge Kavanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service,” the president told a crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly revised Kavanau's nomination as he spoke of the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
“Although I’m not a candidate, I’m actually part of it,” Trump continued.
“That’s why I’m going around and fighting to support the good candidates,” he said.
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves up as a mission to “prevent and hinder”.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanau is expected to take place no later than Friday, as CNN said, one of its co-workers to the Republican Party's top official.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, death toll increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were carried off the coast by giant waves when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when the beach was swept from waves up to six meters (18 feet) high, carried many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami flew after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster,” said Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster relief agency.
“The water had pulled cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything on its way,” Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the coast.
“Some people leaned on the trees and managed to save themselves from the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Published by the disaster agency, photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, demolished and twisted bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosques.
Secondary earthquakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the energy released on Hiroshima Atomic Bomb in World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “huge” and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be higher along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the troika epicenter.
He also added that “communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala”.
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already set off for the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult.”
On Saturday, the agency was furiously criticized for not informing about the devastating Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement.
Shared on social media amateur videos show a man on the top floor of a building screaming at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall collides on the coast and behaves both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage that stopped communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of first need.
The city airport was reopened for rescue operations only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The dead in the Indonesian tsunami are now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala managed to get safely to Palu, where they found shelter in peach shelters crucified in the yard of their office, they passed a number of scenes of devastation, Mr Dosaba said.
“They told me they saw countless destroyed houses.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the initial work on rescue and recovery operations emergency groups, some complain that the rich experience in such situations foreign rescuers are prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, sending staff and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected place is declared a zone of national disaster.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The misery is still at regional level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government announced that it was a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such status,” he said.
As the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami falls over Palo, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing midfielders for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roo-Roo Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As seniors in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roo-Roo Hotel, he had reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
“I think this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 during charging at an ATM in Levi’s Newport
On Friday morning, thieves picked up $26,75 from a Bink employee who had loaded an ATM in Levy's Newport, became clear from a press release of the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to charge it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While the man was busy, another man “ came running behind the back of a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the message continued, but police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the suspects must contact the Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yee.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West”.
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and has been used as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, which gave up “for emotional reasons,” the show’s creator told us.
In addition to being abbreviated to his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance for him.
“I believe that ‘it’ is’ the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’ or ‘you’ shared West earlier this year as you discussed the title of your album with radio host Big Boy.
\"That's how I am you, I'm us, it's us.
He passed from Kanye, which means only one person, simply to Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is a reflection of our essence.
The rapper is one of many known in his sphere, who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and nicknames, including Puff Daddy, Pi Didy or Didy, but this year he announced his preferences for the pseudonyms Leo and Brad Lion.
One of West’s previous associates, Jay Z, also represented himself in a version with or without a tire and/or capital letters in his line.
Mexico president swears not to use the military against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador swore never to use military force. This happened as the country approached the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelko Plaza President Lopez Obrador promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left-wing political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador gave an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to learners and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for the development of AI.
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the United States must double its research budget in this area, according to AI researcher Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various U.S. government officials made statements on the issue of AI, although the United States generally has no official strategy for AI.
China unveiled its plan last year: the country seeks to become No. 1 in innovation in the II by 2030.
“Doubling the budget to develop AI will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make next breakthroughs with regard to AI,” Lee said.
Double funding can also double the chances of the next great achievement in the field of AI coming from the U.S., as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book, “The Superpowers of II: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China’s largest companies – Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellen Lee worked on a system that defeated America’s most successful suitor, then served as CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee gave due to the previous technological competitions of the federal government, such as the Robotics Competition of the Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asked when the next one would be, which would help identify new visionaries.
“Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government funding,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, but corporations,” the man said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring university lights to work on AI.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI programme.
“I think that the I.I. Doctors need to automatically offer green cards,” the man said.
The U.S. State Council unveiled its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, more than $100 million is currently invested in the development of AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not registered any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to \"Republic of North Macedonia\" - a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote for himself in the referendum, while a boycott campaign casts a shadow of whether the referendum would succeed in reaching the minimum 50 percent that are required to recognize its validity.
The question of the newsletter is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formed after the collapse of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have binding force, enough members of parliament have declared that they will comply with the result of it to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the state, two-thirds of parliamentary representatives must vote for this.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the urns.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjosse Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the palaces stretched by the boycotting referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servant door,” Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to the investments needed for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is over 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will be with us, because over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after releasing his own vote.
The statesman also said that the positive result would lead to “affirming the future of our people”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published a survey that found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, done on Macedonian television Telma, revealed that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major blow against the pro-Western government policy since it won power last May.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all of Brighton’s defense and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday to Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outrun three defenders from Brighton before sprinting the ball into the empty space forward.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left the others at the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he went left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-hand kick over Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
“Aguero is struggling with some leg injuries,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We planned to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal right now.
But Sterling was the one who provided the original advance of the “heavenly sons” in this match from the Premier League of England.
He called in the 29th minute.
In the nude situation, Aguero received a deep submission in half of Brighton.
He immediately released a pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sleep advanced with the ball, then find Sterling with a pass on the distant beam.
The attacker of the \"heavenly-sons\" managed to catch close, shortly before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Raine Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play to determine the fate of Rockies
After the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is no particular sense in another match of a title-winning starter.
Still, the ambitious Sherzer hopes to be a titler against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, if the match is relevant to the Rockies, who lead a match with Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West ranking.
Rockies secured their participation at least in the Wild Card game after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is not yet certain they will win their first division title.
“Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss such a game?
Nationals have not yet announced a start-up pitcher for Sunday, but it is assumed that they will allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th game as a start-up pitcher this year, he held a workout on Thursday and would have normal rest time by Sunday.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 extras in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Calls for Supporters in West Virginia
President Koso hinted at the situation with his chosen one about the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanau as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices in our lives.
“This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that while I’m not a candidate, I’m really involved, that’s why I’m fighting all the forces for the right candidates,” Trump said.
Then he continued, “You all see this terrible, terrifying, radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you are yourselves witnesses of their ruthlessness, of malice.
They don’t care when they can hurt who they need to run over to get into power and government, because they’re only interested in power and governance, but we won’t give them away.
The Democrats, according to the president, have set a goal of “preventing and hindering”.
“We all see in the last four days,” he continued, calling the Democrats “angry, nasty, vile, and unfaithful.”
The president recalled the Senate Judicial Commission, referring to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein in a prominent way, which has sparked a lot of outrage from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you distributed the documents?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting--it was really cheap gestures--maybe the worst I've ever seen--
The Labours are no longer wide-ranging.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last member of parliament for now from Labour, who was said not to be welcome – just because I’m speaking honestly.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude, as he faced anti-Semitism decisively.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement during the previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the Labours of Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to involve everyone and be beneficial”.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, Friday's meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of “lighter and more measured” politics have long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It became increasingly obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was judged on how much the party's leadership liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had worked with before thought they shared similar political views began to expect me to turn around and take positions I would never agree with – either national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I’m actually saying – there’s an entire offensive tirade on social media where it’s called for a recall, a rejection of moderate politics, claims that they don’t belong to Labour.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
I know in the interest of truth that I have even made more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me are at least of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of those colleagues who face sexist or racist substitutes every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with any sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep my mouth shut, not to speak so much, and then “all will be well”.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Thatcher government, which through my neglect led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local or as a minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
“To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state pursues Brexit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But really, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party, or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recalling or political exaggeration will refuse me to act in the way I consider best in defense of your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air Leads to Ranking
The two late essays may have changed the final result slightly, but there’s no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game from the Tennis Premier League.
The team has already led the rankings and the only of the ten teams has lost so far.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the game, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very satisfied.
“I’m happy because other teams have been testing us pretty seriously in past games, and we’re still without a loss,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their situation better than us.”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional blow to Frazier Klimo, brought Air forward, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, released to play in the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to catch up on the result after Jason Baggotte realized an essay followed by a failed extra kick.
The climate increased the front for Air from a penitentiary stroke shortly before halftime, noting an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the extra blow, making the score 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra blow to Baggnot, reduced the lead to just five points.
After a lengthy suspension of the game due to the severe injury of Ruard Nott, which was carried out on a carrier, and after the resuming of the game Air increased their advance after an essay of Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
Then Air Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of their numbered advantage, exerting strong pressure and implementing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the spirit’s presence, and when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card after he shot down the Airless climate, McPherson realized an essay using Air’s advanced offensive line.
Klimo made the extra blow, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked-out ball from David Armstrong and took Gregor Henry’s wing on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
Still Game star seems to be heading for a new career in restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems to be heading for a more direct and warm industry after it was found to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular broadcast, which also screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the show, with Kiernan already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official registers, he is the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kirnan had planned to join Glasgow’s “blowing restaurant business”.
\"The sea is ours\": Bolivia's lack of access to the sea hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are constantly patrolling the Okician sea headquarters in La Paz.
There is an ocean blue flag over public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonka are decorated with the motto: “Our sea belongs by law.
It is our duty to return it.
In all Bolivia, which does not have access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit transmitted to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – as is the call to sail again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope has now been the strongest since decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the international court on October 1, after five years of consideration have passed.
“The force is in Bolivia, there is serenity and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic local president, who is about to head for a disputed re-election battle next year, has also made a lot of bets on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to getting back to the Pacific,” Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood that the court would make a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small. Even if it judged in its favor, it would not change things into reality.
In the Netherlands, the United Nations has no authority to take Chile’s territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the international court is only six months after hearing the latest arguments, states that the case “is not complex,” says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may have actually harmed her.
“The problem with access to the ocean was stifled by Bolivia’s current government,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales's military rhetoric had been excavated, and Chile's little one remained in good faith.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to have a normal dialogue.
The two countries have not held diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Weltze, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
He said on Monday that Bolivia would have “an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile, as well as the chance to “end 139 years of disagreement by benefiting both sides”.
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, had used the problem of accessing the ocean as a “political duck”.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to leave the Pacific,” he added.
“A judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue with nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it was unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting his impending nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri called \"an empty hope\" the idea that continuing with U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would make the North fall to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture along the way of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about refusing an arsenal they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the last pee on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun’s rays, you don’t need to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown revealed a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which bewitched the fashion podium during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Pretty impractical hats caused a wave on Instagram in the summer, with designers sending eye-catching their creations to shock the fashion community.
Valentino’s explicit proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a similar feather wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other too huge accessories included decorated with jewelry dunes, a magic hat and even pineapple – but they have no intention of keeping warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had their lips sewn and reminded not so much of the higher fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a melted flint of ice cream.
If you’re in a similar fashion trend, you’re lucky.
Fashion professionals predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come shortly after the La Bomb – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Riana to Emily Rataykovski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat, which took over social media, led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the wearer wearing a swimsuit.
The raffia bag with the color of an overburned orange, with a ravine of raffia and a white leather handle, was the attracting all views of the item in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armid said to Fă: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – once the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for large-scale accessories –
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can put together and bring into effect a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in an understandable language, your words can reach them.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we see that the languages are first and foremost with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high grade A.
Data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools showed that 72% of students achieved A in Chinese, with 72% of students studying German, 69% of French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At present, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in and beyond independent schools.
A study conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Labour Skills Commission showed that for the reasons why employers find it difficult to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competencies.
Therefore, the growing rule of foreign languages becomes mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which turns these skills into essentials in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masteres a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill that remains for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages of a person in front of competition.
According to a study by YouGov, among more than 4,000 UK citizens in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language whose reign reached a two-digit percentage with an indicator of 15%.
Therefore, the investment in language learning today is important for children now.
Managing several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ from the language taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers being specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, no matter what the future hides.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country that requires this to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien just faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
LeBron to make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are anxious to see LeBron James' first match with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the team's first pre-season training match against Denver Nugets in San Diego.
But it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play in the match.
“It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes,” Walton tweeted on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel announced on Twitter that James is likely to play a relatively few minutes in the match.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of Lakers' pre-season preparation.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallies tonight in Weiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump rallies, which include stops in familiar places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Putting off the certifier vote for his election to fill the seat of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are threatened with a loss of control over Congress in the November vote.
What time will the Trump rally take place in West Virginia this evening and how can you watch online?
Trump’s visit to Weiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00, east time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Weiling, West Virginia, below by streaming live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to review this week's hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano, in which tensions have emerged over allegations of immoral sexual acts that keep the Senate's certificate vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation runs.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
President Donald Trump’s campaign declared that these five rallies next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and start a campaign season full of commitments,” a Trump campaign spokesman who refuses to be mentioned told Reuters.
This evening’s rally, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Weiling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw attention to the media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month will be held, in which he won by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisi, who is behind in sociological studies.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisi the fact that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Raider Cup 2018: The U.S. team will fight until last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue-fursam, Sunday afternoon matches may have brought what Raider Cup needed.
Changing the advantage of sports is a rather subjective concept, in which players believe unreservedly, even more in races like this.
Which team is in a better position right now?
“They were running six points, and now they’re only four, so I guess we’ve got a little bit of momentum,” Jordan Spate said at the end of today’s racing day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points at only twelve to distribute.
However, as Spite says, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge by the sporty form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each took three of the four possible points.
Sleep shows an excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of its team.
Fans' encouragements became stronger as he progressed into the round, in which with a precise stroke he leveled the score in the fourth match after two shots left behind with Thomas after the first two holes.
His kick, which won their game at the 15th hole, was met with strong reactions that make us believe that really not everything is lost to the American team.
“The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game,” he said.
That’s all that’s left for these players right now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speed and Thomas in the last two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed character of the Raider Cup so far.
A strange but adorable couple from Europe won four out of four and everything seems to come to them.
“Molliwood” was the only couple who didn’t make ‘gods’ on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn’t have ‘gods’ on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way in which energy passed between them and enthusiastic fans, have confirmed the view that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, who will bring Europe’s potential victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
They are both at the same time on different holes.
The stories of European fame, however, turned out to be a little premature.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the \"fourball\" matches from the morning, while he partnered with Alex Norren.
“Gods and two doubles,” the first nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swede into problems they failed to cope with.
But in Sunday's games, there's no other way to solve your problems.
Fourball and Foursom matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can change at any time.
Europeans played better team games, which is why they gained a significant lead before the last day, but this “foursom” game session showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of Raider Cup
Europe will have a solid lead ahead of the last day of Raider Cup after leading the U.S. 10-6 after playing the football and Foursam matches on Saturday.
Inspirational duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their act of the Le Golf National race rose to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy that he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Byrne's European team dominated the morning Fourball matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and ultimately Europe won the 3 to 1 series.
The U.S. has shown more resistance in the Foursom matches, where they won two wins but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furrick's team needs eight points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood was the first European beginner to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known for their name Molywood, after this sensational weekend became only the second couple to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Rider Cup.
After unappealingly outrunning Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and American newfounder Bryson DeCambu with an even more categorical 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely went through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated his genius, but so far there have been 19 losses from 29 matches in Fourball and Foursom matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who was given a break for the morning Fourball matches, partnered with Henry Stanson in a “foursom” battles in a 2&1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka, respectively number one and number three in the world.
However, the team of Europe has failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They scored a hard 2§1 victory against Spanishs John Ram and Jan Polter in the Fourballs matches, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McKilroy with 4&3 in Foursom, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Raider Cup has the team gotten used to four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the regulation, the Furrick team will keep the trophy even in equality.
However, after being outplayed in two consecutive days, their chances of turning back on Sunday seem not particularly high.
North Korea says there is “no way” to disarm unilaterally, without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions deepened mistrust of the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong-how said that “significant measures of goodwill have been taken in the last year, for example, we are stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see an appropriate reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances will there be a way to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
While Ri voiced North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's resistance to a \"stupid\" approach to removing nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant as it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 when Kim promised to work for “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump gave assurances of North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease strict international sanctions against North Korea.
\"The United States insists that we \"first remove nuclear weapons\" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal through coercion, and even object to \"the declaration of the end of the war,\" Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don’t know us.
However, the problem is that continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting was planned between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the country were South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a halt.
However, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the continental U.S. was inevitable after “the evil president” Trump called Kim a “man-rocket” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, which threatened North Korea with “full destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no deadline for this and said: “It doesn’t matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament takes place.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to halt the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear program and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly’s sidelines and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July with the words that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of making “gangster demands”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “the appropriate measures”.
Kim told him that “the appropriate measures he seeks are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing learning culture “all night” with the help of caffeine.
The lecturer found that students at university number one in the world often don’t even think about when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Caysler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and a women's hospital, prepared a course he thought was the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl finally came to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me that now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of the dream, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students what is essential about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was established that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of a room in a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the sleep routine.
Another part of the participants is how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on your health from your choice of smoking.
The culture of pride from \"learning all night\" still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says, even in order to avoid filling, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a hunger regime that keeps them hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Caysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says his course “opened his eyes” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete such a curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Caysler recommends that students think about whether to set the alarm for bed and wake up and know the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga goal breaks Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's kick broke Stephen Gerard's inexhaustible team and won a 1-0 win for Livingston.
The Aybrox team wanted to record their first victory as a triumph guest in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerard in his 18th matches as manager, leaving his team eight points less than Harts's breakaway team, leader in the Ladbrokes Premier League.
Menga noted seven minutes before the break, and the absence of constructive ideas by Rangers at no time seemed close to leveling.
After the game, Rangers were down to sixth place, and Livingston was already third, leaving the second Hibernian only by goal difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems, as side judge Kalam Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by guest fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same Livingston eleven, who pulled the spot against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team paired all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in rarer cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to mark the second minute Menga pulled a touch on Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a good opportunity.
Later, Kigan Jacobs' centering from foul found Captain Craig Hallcatt, but his defense partner Alan Litgow turned the ball away from the rear beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there had to be a double in the 15th minute when he confronted Stephen Lawles, but referendum Stephen Thomson rejected the claims of the Colombian.
Rangers made only two exact shots in the first half, but former Aybrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily dealt with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak shot of These Ejaria.
Although Livy's 34th minute hit was surprising in view of the possession of the ball, it was completely deserved.
Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs's deep focus.
Scott Arfield didn’t react when Deacon Galaher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who gave Menga a cold-blooded, easy-to-realization.
Gerard responded to the holiday by replacing Culiballi with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when he handed the wing to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a comfortable style of play, with Litgow and Halket constantly turning down long-balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with Jacobs's blow, and under the next corner, Litgow shot with his head next to the beam.
Entrant Glenn Middleton of Rangers asked for a double at the end of the fight after a single-arm match with Jacobs, but Thompson saw nothing wrong again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the geiger counter
Page of our anniversary Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day on which the future physicist Johann Wilhelm-Hans was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as a geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film “The Bells of Coronado” was released, featuring the seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “It’s definitely working right now.”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them.
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them into a laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are injected again into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who trained the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear in more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them into a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then inject again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncological Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer,” explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “training” them how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a cap with the inscription “Let’s make America great again” when we participate in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West wasplayed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing a meaningless performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap with the inscription “Let’s make America great again,” he declared himself against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to white people and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“If I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Law Commission on Sexual Violence Complaints made by Christine Blaze Ford.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, West’s recording of performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They put me behind the scenes.
They said to me, \"Don't go out with that hat.\"
They've put me through!
And then they say I’m on a sinking ship,” he said.
West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship,” claiming to be wearing Superman’s suit, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.
The comments caused at least twice the public's gigs, and SNL's team members looked embarrassed, Varianty said, saying, \"The whole studio shut up.\"
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the song \"I Love It\" dressed as a bottle \"Perie\"
West received the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Kandes Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the boldest: THANK YOU FOR PERFORMING THE TUPPE . . .
But Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “self and that’s wonderful”.
“But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying music or his clothing or supporting his art), whom I think welcomes and distributes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That’s what we are,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now “is now officially known as Kenny West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and he follows Didi's example, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pixy Didy.
His friend, rapper Snap Dog, was called Snap Lyon, and music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Charge of attempted murder after knife stab at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after being stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington opposes toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as John Snow's swinger sword in a violent medieval fantasy series of NGO \"Game of Thrones\"
But the actor, who is 31, has declared against the macho hero's stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen often makes young people think they need to be \"raw\" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that “something went wrong” and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels “strongly convinced” that this problem needs to be solved.
“I am very confident at the moment – what we have confused about masculinity,” he said.
“What do we teach young men about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by TV and on the street that makes boys feel like they need to become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something's confused for young men--
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistory or sequels of Game of Thrones after the end of the series in the following summer, claiming to have “completed with the battlefields and horses”.
As of November, Keith will play in the restoration of the True West of Sam Shepherd, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so that’s how he gave me my future family and defined my life in advance,” he said.
Rose plays Game, the girl Keith's character John Snow falls in love with, in fantasy series, the Emmy Award winner.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and spin.
According to the country’s health services, more than 820,000 people are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the spill of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities was widespread.
Studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medications as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies any leak of Senators from the Republican Party, denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”.
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information to three U.S. senators from Republicans on the Wikipedia lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and sites on the “ultra right wing”.
“Leaders, lies and more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitolia during a Senate hearing on charges of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanau.
The leak took place after the three senators questioned Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications is linked to the Waters office and has released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
“This unfounded statement is completely false and is an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My team member – whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unwarranted statement is completely false and is an absolute lie.
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flayscher.
“There’s a lot of anger in this denial,” Flasher wrote.
This suggests that it does not have a temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
He doesn't have to be challenging.
I don’t have to question the prosecutor’s motives.
It must be calm and balanced.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavano's Democrats, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the midterm elections, also said on Twitter.
“If it’s true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had called the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
Johnny English's \"Johnny English Blows Up Again\" Review: Rowan Atkinson's Weak Spy Parody
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new film with British participation, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of action comedy, a spy franchise for Johnny English – which launched in 2003 with Johnny English – and came back in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will the self-smile and the mimics who say how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes entrenched and “tired” face has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a large comical creation intended for cinema fans who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattery, has little of Cluzo, little of Mr. Bean, and much of the man who contributed with a note on the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the leaving chaos behind a traveler and an international man whom Atkinson plays in the already forgotten television advertisements of Barclaycard.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are either two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, carrying in a medieval armory, and for a short while, the fins turned into his helmet.
Atkinson’s contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” film brands such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, but Johnny English’s devastating accidents are not innovative and focused, as Actinson’s play does not remind Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the operative agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is an bloated and pumpy figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best for this quasi-Terreza-May role, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors have informed her that she needs to call a retired agent, as all of her agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a chic center who, however, illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English was summoned to whitehall for emergency instruction and reunited with former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man married to a submarine commander, a cheerful role in which Wiki Pepperdin's talent is little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their farce odyssey: dressed as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of the Volta; and English causes a real anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and lush, here there is much more content intended for children.
It's quite an indirect production.
As with other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies they are developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that allows the British to work four weeks but get paid for five.
The party says it wants the heads of companies to provide savings made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers by giving them another rest day.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would “be” on the party’s economic agenda and plans to shake the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week is approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party official told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that before the end of the year it will be notified of a policy review.
“It will not happen immediately, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its joint campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not in the party’s policy.
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from “unpersonal directors” and “speculators” in utility companies.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current owners of shares in water companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour government could impose ‘restraints’ on the basis of established infringements.
He also confirmed plans to bring workers into the board of companies and create privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private firms to employees who can accumulate annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindy Graham and John Kennedy talk 60 minutes ago about whether the FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano slowed his final vote for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could cause some of the Republican party's senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open compared to his South Carolina colleague.
“I want to say,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident after this statement came out, and I asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, firm, and unambiguous.
But Graham’s voice seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion about Brett Kavano and to change it, it takes a shocking accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blassy Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs just as impressive a mission: to eliminate poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the Great Morava in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B. and Sean Mendes, but also get acquainted with the true goal of the event – eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “acts” as voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, calling by phone or connecting otherwise to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is a “Global Citizen” 12 years before he achieves his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be convinced to require action or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” – people think they’re doing something significant when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “acts” from its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion already being paid or raised.
The group believes that the funding has already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the “Feeding Power” established in the UK partnership between investors and contractors, committed to “assisting children to develop their full potential” which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help stop malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 Twitter posts by “global citizens” have been received.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into just a historic note,” the ambassador of the Food Power told a live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government reported on funding a project, “The Power of Nutrition – which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the WHOs on his website, asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“A global citizen,” he replied, “will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fail and fail again.
But just as in the big civil rights movement and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janet Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, which will lead to Deborah-Lee Férnes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use naval forces to “block” and hinder energy exports – the interior minister
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinc has revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zink claims that Russia’s engagement in Syria, in particular, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market,” he said.
Zink turned to those present at the event, organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to deal with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
“The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, the stimulation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while calling Russia “a pony with a number” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is tasked with boosting its exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is turning Berlin into a “captive”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position sparked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the 2020 presidential bid, Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he would “take a serious look” at the presidential bid after the midterm elections.
During a city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
\"After November 6th, I will take a serious look at the presidential bid.\"
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was voiced in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said \"of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.\"
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this bid.
The sociological study showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic Party officials discussed over a potential bid in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to PTSR at a Donald Trump rally at Trak Palin
At the age of 26, Palin spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through after he’s back is known to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” she told the crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an \"elephant in the room\" and said of his son and other war veterans that \"they return a little changed, engrossed, return and wonder if they will receive that respect that they and their brothers have given to the country.\"
He was arrested on Monday in Vassila, Alaska and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, he was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an unsightly state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for Vassila's police administration.
18 states and districts of Colombia support challenge new asylum policy
The 18 states and the District of Columbia support the judicial challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and districts applied for good will in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions case has not been disclosed, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner \"and the sons of his gang's cruel members\" harassed her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come, such as nations facing comprehensive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned the decision of the 2014 Immigrant Appeals Council, which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Racin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"ignors decades of state, federal and international law\"
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that a policy that refuses to enter immigrants harms the U.S. economy, pointing out that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce”.
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic harassment and gang violence.
“A refuge is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in a statement on 11 July.
The asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double during search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is becoming increasingly difficult.
“I feel very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance carries more corpses.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were filled.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a fracture in the spine and shoulder, were placed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the broken wall,” Harris told Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they are safe.
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China in “Tormose” with “ Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page commercial in the U.S. daily for the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump called for China Daily’s paid publication in Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump’s indictment that Peckie is trying to interfere with the U.S. Congress election, noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently taking part in an escalating trade war in which import tariffs are levelled between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China at the beginning of the trade war, tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstadt, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime Iowa governor, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstadt wrote in a commentary on the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is now doubling this harassment by releasing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government has benefited from a respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and the press by launching paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstadt wrote.
“In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have on China’s worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most famous newspapers avoids the proposal to publish,” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh’s pogrom, Republicans reject women’s voters for mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many of the senior Republicans are behind and defending the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano over several sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that there will be a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around the pan are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
“These things cannot be brought back,” said Grant Raher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
He said he doubts whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute request for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters chanted \"November is coming\" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judiciary decided to continue the nomination of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blassy Ford's testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” Stu Rotenberg, a party political analyst, told the news.
“People say that the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among women voters in suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that a response could follow if Republicans insist on confirming the bid.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party’s National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kavano is placed on the bench. It’s about the way Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe as a result of Ford and Kavano’s testimony, and slightly more branched to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent said they believed Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent say Kavano probably or certainly lied during his testimonials, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate court that Kavano had attacked her in an unwise state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Team Burners-Lee is launching a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s intent was “world domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he said in terms of the project.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses the Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online storage of personal data” or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and is at the same time all of them at the same time.
The unique thing about the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “the granting of personal data powers”.
The idea of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who have signed a contract to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change or not, when all their business models were completely updated for one night.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a publication in Media Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.

Bernard Van: in memory of the priest, awarded with the cross Victoria in the First World War
It is celebrated 100 years in the native city of the only Anglican priest awarded with a cross Victoria for his participation in combat operations during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he had been honored with Britain's highest military honors.
A memorial was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was \"extremely symbolic\" for the monument to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's medal-winning work.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and under heavy artillery and machine gunfire”.
He later attacked the line of fire, and with “an incredible courage,” he built a forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van set a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was \"a great honor for him to participate in the parade\" and added \"the virtue of the real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people.\"
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellar 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine that you’ve been waiting all night to watch the full Bellator 206 and finally you can’t witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six of the main card and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after being up until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fan described on Twitter switching the children's animation film as \"some kind of sick joke\"
“The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the program has been replaced by a children’s broadcast,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator’s marketing and communications, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
“Peppa Pig – Yes”
Bellator President Scott Cocker said he would work on planning meetings to include viewers from Britain in the future.
“In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Koker said.
“But there’s six in the morning on Sunday and there’s no way to plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will stick to the inclusion of five matches instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we overdo it.
This is an unpleasant situation.
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lesser” because of his sexuality
Tom Daley said he grew up feeling lower than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in high school, he did not realize that “not everyone is like me”.
In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent lead of the long-time show, Kirsty Young, is in the hospital for a few months.
While participating in Laverne Daley’s first program, he said he felt “less” than everyone else as he grew up, as “it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys”.
He said, “To this day the feeling of inferiority and the fact that I’m different from others are actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he “surprisingly” him.
Daley has married an Oscar carrier who is 20 years older than him last year, but claims that age difference has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young,” he first participated in the 14-year Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone your age who’s experienced similar ups and downs.”
The two became parents in June and had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley himself said that “his entire worldview has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – as he wanted to be on the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with me, Dad, or in the first row,’ he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that moment, when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew I’ve dreamed about it all my life – jumping to the Olympics in front of the audience at home.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Smoll – who accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still made him push.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 pm, British summer time.
Mikelson's lost form remains on the Raider Cup rock on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game at Raider Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be associated with failure.
Michelson, who took part in a two-year event for the record-breaking 12th time, was left on the rock by Captain Jim Furrick for “fourball” and “foursom” matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure again in the U.S. team, the five-time winner of big tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who has never been among the most right-wing players at the top of his career, is not in the optimal form for Le Golf National’s difficult field, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the field itself is not alarming enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson will face the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who is on the team with the new defender Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all four games this week.
If Americans who are behind four points before the 12 singles match make a strong start, it may be that Michaelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly say something very different.
“He fully understood his role today, patted my back, embraced me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing just two games.
I expected him to play more, but that's just how it turned out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else.
Michelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most games in the Raider Cup played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career at Raider Cup, which never came close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furick said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to joke with people, and he’s a great guy for every team,” he said.
“I think younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing.
Thomas Byrne, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advance can soon be melted.
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Byrne, knows from personal experience that the great advantage accumulated before the matches of the last day of the Raider Cup can be easily erased.
The Dutchman made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but right on the final line was almost reached and barely managed to hold the 141-2-131 win.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead on ‘Valderrama’; we also had a big lead on ‘Brookline’ where we lost, and at ‘Valderrama’ we won, but very hard,” said Byern, after the 2018 team of Europe won 5 – sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10-6 of Le Golf National:.
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you have to do.
Nothing is finished until you see the end result of the board.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that’s exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I have always said that I only think of the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.
Satisfying with the performance of players on a difficult golf course, Byrne added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Individual performances will come out tomorrow, and that’s different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out on your own, then you test your entire capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that needs to reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he also needs to give himself up to the end –
Unlike Byrne, rival captain Jim Furrick will ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, with exceptions being only Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great opposites on the last day - he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then it was on the losing side when the Europeans committed the \"Miracle of Medinah\"
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to start the same good start as you saw at Brookline, as well as at “Medinah”.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under tremendous tension.
That’s why we formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want to try to make the impossible tomorrow.
Thomas is assigned the task of leading our counterattack and confronting Rory McKilroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“I chose these players in this row because I think that gives us the greatest chance of success,” Byrne said of his choice for the singles.
Germany postpones launch of new warship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War-era battleships, but this would not happen until next year due to faulty systems and arbitrarily growing cost, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz brand-leading new frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The vessel had to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned by the fleet in 2007, will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have powerful weapons, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the port of residence.
However, continuous delays mean that vanguard warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate force across the ocean – will be old when they enter into operation, Die Zeit said.
The F125 became headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of significant “software and hardware defects” that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
Software disadvantages are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its effectiveness and limits the possibility of the naval forces to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including training the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is believed to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, admitted that the fleet was actually “exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions”.
The official said the problem had become bigger in time, as the old ships were taken out of operation, but no new ones were provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
National Trust Tracks Secret Life of Bats
A new study carried out at an estate in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape when hunting.
Hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust will follow the common bats, as well as the brown arrow water nights at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places in the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the bats, as well as what types they issue.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used of any kind.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. creating meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and Britain have generally declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their refuges and lead to loss of habitats.
There may be a risk to populations from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the blind are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles to their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Threee estate in the Dumfries and Galaway area, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The owner of the estate, David Thompson, said it was an ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threeve, we have great terrain for the bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many adult trees and a finished suitable habitat.
But there are many more things about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stressed that it is important to check for the presence of bats before real estate maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of one asylum will kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy the entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their refuges.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer in the Trust for the Protection of the Bats, encouraged society to help.
She said, “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers will judge a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news” by saying that people “want to become famous” using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, turning to its 142 million followers, hours after the announcement of the 33-year-old Ronaldo condemned the publication as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball holder told the camera.
“They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
“I’m a happy person, and everything’s fine,” the player smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they call “unacceptable publication of suspicions in the area of personal life,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherz said the footballer would claim compensation for \"moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.\"
The incident occurred in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer's room, where she was alleged to have been raped anally, according to documents filed in the district court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the Ronaldo incident, he fell to his knees and told her he was “a good boy” at “99 percent” but in this case he simply succumbed to “one percent”.
Ronaldo said they had sex, but it happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt “horrified by revenge” and was worried that “she was not publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid by Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK “will regret forever” losing car manufacturers
Britain \"will regret forever\" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
Japan’s automaker said the impact of a delay in a no-deal Brexit border could lead to job losses.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis models were manufactured last year, produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in cases of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line works on the principle of “just in time” with parts arriving every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages in parts, according to the industry.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to wait more than a day to fill their inventory at the Darbisher plant, the company said, and that's why production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's \"chemistry\" plan for a future relationship with the EU was \"precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks\"
“We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to grab that opportunity,” he said in the BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“After claims not only to Toyota, but also to other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production will be stopped, but has warned in the long run that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “I am judging from my experience that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU,”
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, the White House said.
An extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be \"delayed for another week\" as the candidate's fight for Supreme Court Brett Kavano continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is watching the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy chief prosecutor or not will threaten Mueller's independence, he has been feeding rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this statement.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not to” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal committee hearing, which Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of appeals against Kavanaugh, further slowing the full Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday after Fox News.
When she was asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It’s not yet a set date for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think, could be delayed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.\"
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The head of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that rare press conferences were not due to the “demonstrational behavior” of television journalists, although he said: “I can’t say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstration behavior.”
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more sessions with questions and answers from every president before him,” she said, adding, without citing evidence: “We checked these statistics,” she said.
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you are witnessing to practice it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guest officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and moments of strange behavior in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister addresses EU workers at Scotland’s National Health Service in terms of Brexit-related fears
The health minister addressed the EU staff working in Scotland’s National Health Service in writing to express the country’s recognition and desire to remain in its post-Brexit post-Brexit positions.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter in less than six months until Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, and decisions are expected in this fall.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Members from across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would very much like you to stay here –
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' Linebacker, Christian Abercrombie, had an emergency operation after receiving a head injury during a Saturday meeting when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27.
Tennessee State Senior Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred shortly before half-time.
“He went to the side line and somehow he just fell there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave oxygen to Abercrombies on the side line before he was laid on a stretcher and carried to the dressing rooms for further examination.
Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had gone out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are still no details about the type/seriousity of the trauma, and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year college scholarship student, is for the first season at Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms when buying real estate in the UK
Under new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the coat of arms will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state treasury expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds per year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms in the purchase of real estate in the UK, with additional revenue going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and targeting people with high income.
The increase in the coat of arms will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues helping the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current coat of arms order, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of lending – can amount to up to three percent.
The state treasury expects the proceeds to rise by up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price increases and making it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to interfere in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become ghost cities due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy emerged just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the coat of arms order to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon the affordable housing quotas to fix Britain’s “homage disgrace”.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rent control and the end of the “no blame” expulsions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always have open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy as easily homes as the hard-working residents of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the insult from sleeping on the street remains too realistic.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team.”
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that “the greatest ambition in his career is to be the senior coach of Scotland’s national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish man has accepted the challenge of reinvigorating the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third position in the First League, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Miron back to the Scottish Higher League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one match for the B team, and that was all,” Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with Hampton Scotland matches, which we watched together as a child with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
“This opportunity, however, would only open up if I had success at the club level.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers are names such as Dick Advocate, David Moses, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet, and Paolo Di Kanio.
A former Alois Athletic teacher said he did not experience concern as a successor to such established names at such a famous club, and he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuich Town.
“For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League,” he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I’ll accept that I’ve only achieved success here if I can get the team back there.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miron from a falling team to a champion at the Championship next season.
Ross said he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartleypool, Folkerck, St. Myron and Hamilton Academy.
“I was really at the crossroads – he remembers the time he took Aloe.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best place for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant successes.
Sometimes being a player is hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I’m still facing the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel like being a manager is the right direction for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I’m really doing it, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin all my conscious life.”

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, a study reveals
Summer heat increased the income of the struggling British pubs, but accumulated more tension for the chain of restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the business-consultant CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the lengthy solar time and longer continued from England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July followed a similar model as June, when pubs reported a growth of 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The drop of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and drink bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Eating pubs also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, the sales of drinks jumped 6.6 percent per month, while in food there was a 3 percent decrease.
Paul Newman, of RSM recreation and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend that we noticed at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the service sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales by 4.8 percent per year can be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer couldn’t have appeared at a worse time for food managers, and only time would it show if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is an established indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides a secret social network profile from their parents
One in five children – some only 11 – have a secret social network profile that hides from their parents and teachers.
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
The news has raised fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” profile that they show their parents
One in five children – some one in 11 – create a social network profile that keeps secret from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Instagram accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised fears that material with sexual content was published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “main” profile that they showed their parents, while having secret profiles.
A mother who came across the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter who found a teenage child who encouraged others to “rape” him.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Conference of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Aylid Doyle will be “the voice of the athletes” on the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Aylid Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as a director without executive functions at the annual general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s lightweight athlete with the most achievements, and President Ian Beatty has defined this move as a great opportunity for those who lead in sports to take advantage of her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Eyide enjoys great respect in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly with its attraction,” Bity said.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200-400-meter finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator in the BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I was hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would tell if it would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I do mobility training!

Advertising a milk pump that compares mothers with cows, divides online reviews
A company producing milk pumps divides online opinions with advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows that are breastfeeding.
In order to mark the launch of the expected “first silent milk pump in the world suitable for wear,” Elvie released a mock-up music video advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives infants to show off.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's clothing full of hay, against the background of a song with a text, including: \"Yes, I'm breast-feeding, but you don't see any tails\" and \"If you haven't noticed, it's not a udder, it's my breasts.\"
The song continues: “Pump up, pump up, feed the babies, pump, pump up, breastfeed your friends,”
However, the advertisement, published on the Facebook page of the company, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was downplaying the “horrible” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth.
Elvie milk pump is collected discretely in breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breastfeeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added: “So much inappropriate advertising,”
Others defended the advertisement by admitting that one woman considered the song “extremely fun”.
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Draining made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little loud, but I accept it as it is.
“This product is brilliant,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who drain (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like “bloods”
This is not advertising, praising or condemning the milk processing industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and is collected discretely in a bra for infants, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even go outside while they are draining.
Anna Balarin, a partner and CEO at Mother’s, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch on the market.
By drawing a parallel between infants and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to milk drains and all the challenges associated with this, while also showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has fallen into the news.
During the Fashion Week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium for designer Martha Yakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and policy by the Trump administration has made it difficult for children with guardians to stay.
Usually, most guardians are immigrants without documents who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults from the family should provide fingerprints, and these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or members of the guardians’ family live illegally in the country, with most of them being foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these faces,” Albens said.
In their quest to deal faster with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as the previous norm was, according to officials at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as inappropriate for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to become suppressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to officials at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers have said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Tornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the “palatka city” without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria urges “occupational troops” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has continued for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are staying illegally on Syrian soil under a pretext to fight terrorism and “will take appropriate action”.
“They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions,” he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost at its end, in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands were cleansed – both by terrorist organizations and by “any illegal presence of foreigners”.
The U.S. has about 2,000 Syrian military personnel who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian forces, opposition from President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the lands of the devastated country.
Regarding the refugees, Mualem said the conditions were tolerable and could return, accusing “some Western countries of “strengthening soilless fears” that prompt refugees to stand aside.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate on these returns,” he said.
“They are turning into a political issue something that is entirely a humanitarian issue,” he said.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be given to the restoration of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib allowed for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would target the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-related Al-Nusra front, who would “be destroyed”.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call on the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem has outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to \"review of the members of the current constitution\" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Wins Second Term
Under this logic, Trump will win re-election in the 2020 election, unless, as many liberal viewers likely hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be “the most dramatic end to the presidency”.
There are currently no signs of fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, the Primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during Primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” tops the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinners.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neil Bayer, executive producer of ABC’s Last Candidate drama, where he tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on Capitolia.
Nell Skovel, a veteran comedy screenwriter and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Skovel told me he said to her, \"Because she makes me laugh.\"
There's a lot of fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that appears on television, Washington-based stories can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to six hours of watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses “deep historical information” as a source for his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s pilot jacket from a strous skin for $15,000 (“A suit full of arrogance,” according to The Washington Post), and Stormy Daniels’ shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump’s anatomy.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing to make you feel like part of a reality show is giving you a little bit every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of ‘Pawn Stars’ in terms of changing participants and day-to-day turns (coupling with the National Football League, praise for Kim Jong Un).

When I contacted Mr. Fleece this week, it was sunny on Kawai's north coast, 80 degrees, but he closed at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Kavano had to face the Senate’s legal commission and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
“I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ Mr. Fleece told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investing in the most contested race in early elections for a seat in Congress
It is no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a stream of money, thanks to the reorganization of Congress districts and hence two titles for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh indicated conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another titler, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which stands out for the new 17th.
The maps were re-drawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the broadly discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe that Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. considers imposing sanctions on El Salvador over its support for China and then withdraws
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to call off the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Heather Naworth, a spokeswoman for the Department said earlier this month.
But sanctions against El Salvador alone were anticipated, which in 2017 received about $140 million in US aid to fight drugs for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cutting out financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been problematic for the state of Central America with its unemployment and a percentage of the killings.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served as a continuation of such a gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management authorities said they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will participate in a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. MPs quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokeswoman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move may be the report of Special Advisor Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, with the report currently being significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to take account of this authority, just when he is preparing to stand up to the voters, as well as, perhaps, the judges made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I don’t think Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor is it the same as those of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to commit a coup against Hitler, as long as the West had rebelled against him and had supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We broke in and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of the massacre.
The course of history depends on such moments, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans are facing a number of such times.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger since this newspaper reported that he had proposed to secretly write down the president last year and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story at The Times was incorrect.
“How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavano, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite the allegations of sexual assault and fraud?
And above all, will we vote in the early congressional election if it forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy is waiting for us for a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because I have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles at that table, wearing swastika.
With a legacy like how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosts of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from the G-League Europe.
An injury in the knee did not allow midfielder Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the 2-2 equation in question with Villareal, but he believed that for Rangers this result could turn into a Trumplin to greater achievements.
“We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent,” said the 31-year-old footballer.
“We got into the game with the hope that we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but overall equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
We looked at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match, because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened next to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the trainings are beneficial.
I hope we can harness all our strengths to forget last season and achieve the desired successes.
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their husbands.
Only 10 percent have spoken to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven’t taken steps towards this conversation,” said Holly Sneider, vice president of the nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not state your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and your family discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy, with a monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the beginning.
Name a health care officer so that you have a certain creditor who monitors your medical care and ensures that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also consider the idea of an attorney general on financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical care and travels to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Show these details in writing to be prepared.

A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while returning home in the evening outside.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police describe the shooting that took place around 02:30 a.m. British Summer Time, as an “accidental act”.
The victim failed to see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the death to rise.
Due to interruptions in communications, aid organizations cannot receive information from Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is located closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the main facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach edge on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that spans more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than the province, has approximately a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the province's central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal Dongala region.
The production of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite bank of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami flew to the west of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly destroyed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26th on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activates a wave of tsunamis that flew 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coastline of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-megaded earthquake over Indonesia’s most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude magnitude earthquake of 7.5 cut one of the Mentawa Islands and activated a 10-meter wave of tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of whom on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in a wasteland.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trac Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report by state police in Alaska, released on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a female woman tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin has been detained in the Mat-Su pre-retention building and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared “innocent, certainly,” when asked about pladition, the media reported.
Palin is threatened with three A-class offenses, which means he can be deprived of his freedom for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with class B offense, which is fined with one day in prison and a $2000 fine.
That's not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being investigated by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involvement in the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of weapons under the influence of the substance in connection with the incident.
His friend claims he hit her with a fist in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016, when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that killed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network is interrupted, with the number of dead expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, there are videos that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami waved across the coast.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for suspect in New York City terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City, in which eight people were killed – a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a home Depot rental truck to carry out the attack in October on a veil near the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, trampling pedestrians and cyclists along his way.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily damage, according to a notice of intent regarding the death penalty claim filed in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges can be brought to an end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, an expanded federal judicial body referred Saipov to a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of racket-related murder, used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and the destruction of MPS.
The attack required “serious planning and intention,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s way of carrying out a “horrible, cruel and disgusting” attack.
“Sifululo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego’s family and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Hernan Felucci, and Alejandro Damian Panuko,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last South District of New York was seeking a death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was later sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in New York City was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek nationalist, did not show a sense of repentance during the days and months after the assassination, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He filed an indictment of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that “they are obviously disappointed – by the prosecutor’s decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of accepting a sentence for guilt and life without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all those affected,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defence team had previously asked the prosecutor’s office not to seek a death sentence.
Conservatives member says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to \"mobilize the army of the people\" today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should “feel pressure” – as one of Theresa May’s own party members suggested he conduct negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, told Birmingham in March that Britain \"would have gone out by now - if Mr. Farage had been Secretary for Brexit issues.
But Mrs May's challenge to deal with the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who supported the stay who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan “Chequers” despite the attacks by the supporters of Brexit, the remaining EU.
Allies insist that she will make progress in trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her package and “chaosa”.
Mr. Bonn told protesters with a slogan, “Exit means going out,” in Solihill, that he wanted to “dispose Chequers”.
He stressed that Mr. Farage had to take part in the talks with the others and that he had to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we would have left by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan.
Saying his opposition attitude towards the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be more robust.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn rejected the claim that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservatives representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped to be elected.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians should \"feel the pressure\" if they intend to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit, and we’ve gathered here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’”
In an address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to force our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that helped us win the Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governing, proud of the United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters of the stay went on a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A handful of activists have raised flags with the inscriptions \"Conservatives against Brexit\" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked Conservatives for the security issues of the party's application when it opened at the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy IT systems and all of Canada’s technology, and more, for an unhindered crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
“This is a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren said he would “think seriously” about his presidential bid.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would “consider seriously the possibility of running for president after the November election.”
Boston Globe reported that a Democrat representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a persistent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican state representative Jeff Dale, who was a joint president of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she can take Trump’s position in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayoral building after Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was high time “women went to Washington and repaired our damaged government, and this included women at the top”.
He was arrested for the death of Sims by LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday he had a suspect arrested in Friday's shooting when basketball player Wade Sims of LSU was killed.
Baton Rouge's police department reported on Dayton Simpson's arrest, a 20-year-old, at a press conference at 11:00 east time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man who is visible to the footage.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
“Weid Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, had a gun and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested seamlessly and detained in the arrest of East Baton Rouge.
A young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims participated in 32 games with 10 appearances last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 matches per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped defeat Sebastian Vetel
Ever since Walter Bottas was ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's instructions will play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously disturbed Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns, allowing Fethel to attack his teammate.
The festival first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the race's exit.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next tour and came out after the Fethel, but Hamilton managed to outrun him after a bold maneuver and riding a tire that forced Ferrari's pilot to release the inner part of the runway to avoid time-added punishment after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double protective maneuver at the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the rear lines of the start grid and was seventh after the end of the first round.
He then even led the race for a long time, as he decided to change his tyres later than the rest, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly outrun Kimi Raikonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered for a pit stop in the 44th round, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Rykonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Walter did a great job all weekend, and he showed up like a real gentleman when he let me out of his way.
The team did an outstanding job to win the first two places on the podium,” Hamilton said.
It was really a bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday for claiming she had not spread the letter from Christine Blaze Ford, accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano of sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate’s legal commission, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and disgusting and dishonest”.
“What can happen and the good that happens in the Senate the last few days when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at publications and spreads, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document: “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread \"
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we did not spread, he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter detailing Ford’s claims against Kavanaugh in July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the spread had happened from her office.
“I didn’t cover up Ford’s claims, I didn’t spread her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep my privacy and I kept my privacy as she wanted.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continued to defend the claimant for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president said Democrats were using their own claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
Look at the shamelessness, shamelessness, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they have to run over to regain their power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundy
Dundee Stars returned for their Friday loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants, beating the Dundy rematch by 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants led an early match with two goals after hitting Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kaoney leveled for the hosts before Duyer regained the lead of the Giants.
François Bushard was equal to Dundy before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals were to harden their victory.
This is the third win in the Elite League for the boys of Adam Kiff, who got out of the bottom to beat Dundi in Belfast by 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
The hit that Duyer discovered came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m. with the assistance of Kendall McFaull, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting Bowillier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level with the help of Cowney at 15:16.
Duyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break, scoring the second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The housewives re-grouped and Bushar again leveled the chances of a powerful blow in the door at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundy a head start for the first time at the end of the second half, and he did his best to harden the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who lost the last four matches of a total of five matches, welcome host Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Flight Manager Died To Make Sure Hundreds Of People On Board A Plane Can Escape From An Earthquake
In Indonesia, the flight manager was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing during a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a wave of tsunamis.
The strong secondary earthquakes continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufry Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided to crash.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Control, Indonesia, Johannes Syrian, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency said access to the cities of Dongala, Siggy and Butong was limited.
“We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
There are shops everywhere in the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready,” CNN said.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The plane that carried out a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean is now reporting that one person was reported missing after saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said on Saturday afternoon they could not contact a male passenger.
The airline added that it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details of the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of locals helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It remains unclear the cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and U.S. naval forces said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane has gone very low.
“That’s very nice,” says Janes.
Janes says he and the others were able to get through the deep water cross to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewardesses had fallen into panic and were screaming, and that he had suffered a slight injury to the head.
U.S. naval forces say sailors repairing a dock nearby also helped in the rescue operation using an inflatable boat to take people to the shore before the plane sank into the deep 30 metres of water (100 ft).
According to data from the Safe Aviation Network, 111 people have been killed during the last two decades on flights registered with PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyse exposes chronology to the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended his case on Saturday in a repeat trial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette from the U.S. Department of Justice has testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulette said he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town on that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that \"this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville.\"
Another disparity is that Tellis said he knew Chambers from two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Roulette said shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis had deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He has removed it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is planned to begin with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the hearings later that day.

Another black man?
New York Babysitter Judges Couple After Fire for “racist” Message
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a mis-sent message from a mother who complains she is “another black woman”.
The couple denies being racist, emphasizing the demand for “extortion”
Linzy Plasko-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was horrified when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“The next black man,” Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, she felt “uncomfortablely” Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing the job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris received a salary for a working day and then sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal by asking for $350 a day for the six-month contract she was originally hired for, even though she didn’t have a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “You’re sure it’s discrimination.”
In response to the request, the couple said they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable act, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasko told Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it were wrong?
You're the newborn?
Think of yourself \"
Liken to an \"extortion\" request, Plasko claims that his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a \"very difficult position\" position.
“Are you going to attack someone in this state?”
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
While the trial is still under consideration, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, denying them about their behavior and their logic.
\"Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not have felt a connection to a talking bear,\" a new letter said.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, tells the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun now, once we’re aware of the great success of puddington.
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC, before being inspired to write the children's book for a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic about possibly rejecting the book, adding that he was welcoming the 60th anniversary of the book's publication \"with mixed feelings\" after his death last year.
With respect to Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family,” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very humble man and he wasn’t self-inflicted,” she said.
“But since you felt that it was so real, it’s like having a child who’s achieved something: you’re proud of it, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he kind of accepted the success of puddington in that way.
Although he was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited the merits of the Padington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad was constantly calling to say that the situation is really bad that he does not expect to survive,” said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
“Afterwards, Nad called me to say he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, \"Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leaving her system.
She left a while ago, and that's how it all ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get tight.
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who has so far been saddened by the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test she is going through.
“No one understood,” she said.
“I had my head down and all the time my tears were falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this pervasive sense of compassion with Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Sad women place cards to prevent suicide from bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wells cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Leedney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by smile.
They always said that his smile lights up every room.
But he gave up his job before he left, and he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards \"to let people know that there's someone to go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t keep your mouth shut – you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed, or something else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.

Bret Kavano's future is in question after FBI launches investigation
I was wondering if we could really achieve what he wanted – an investigation with limited duration and limited scope – maybe we could unite our efforts,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee “is falling apart” despite a strong over-party blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It's because of the moment itself.
The early elections are only five weeks from now, on November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans do not perform well, their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the country will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush is calling for senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavano, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
North Korean Refugees 'Reduced' by Kim
South Korean lawmakers say North Korean refugees have declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Sug, citing data from the South Korean Unity Ministry, said last year there were 1127 refugees, compared to 2706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts requested by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people are fleeing through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and it is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, often forcing them to be repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on a standstill in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally worked for a Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavano \"Isterical\" and said it was not suitable for service at the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano “isteric” and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“There was no way of thinking that if a woman had reacted that way, they would have called her ‘steric’,” Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate legal committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the allegations that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his inaugural speech Kavano was very emotional, at times he almost cried and felt when discussing his family and school years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a “gross and coordinated attack on the personality” organized by liberals who were dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavano’s testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was prejudiced by the Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with these claims and the way he’s after the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi denied it when asked if he would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and in case Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is unfit not only to enter the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions regarding the Law on affordable health care or the Row v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for an hysterical, prejudiced man to enter the court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it great?’” Pelosi concluded.
Women need to be mastered.
This is a legitimate criticism, after months and years of dispelling anger, and it cannot accept it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” said Mrs. Steinum 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, but you do.”
She continued, “I received a huge help from a woman who was an executive who shared that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she told her interlocutor, “You may think I’m sad because I cry.
I'm angry.
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.
Tears are allowed in an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at the beginning.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how, once, as I nodded from an inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the door – a freezing head I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy they did it to you.
Patricia Schröder, a democratic Colorado congressman at the time, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a yacht called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a good decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing that wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves”
As she engages late in the campaign, she lags behind in raising funds and decides she will not stay in the race if she fails to raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount,” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was watered by so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system for which it is so difficult to raise money and to be able to turn to the voters, not to the delegates, and anger against sexism that she felt.
“A man may think I’ve got a nervous breakdown,” she recalls how the media reacted.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were going to write on my gravestone?
“She’s crying,”
How the trade war between the United States and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, while the battle is still gaining speed, a break-up between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning rally this year, betting on key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions this week has emerged with new tariffs that affect production for $200 billion (150 billion British pounds) with an effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing returned with counter tariffs of five to ten percent of U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight back every blow to the United States, and it is not expected that the world’s second-largest economy will ignore this.
To make Washington give up means to submit to the demands, but to put his head in public in front of Washington would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure from the US trade war can help China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political solution in both Washington and Beijing can create conditions for an economic crisis in either of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate on issues related to Asia to the expert group at the New American Security Center.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in the country’s recovery, devastated by the war, which lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists to return them to their normal state.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their diet.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional support or assistance from the states that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins Raider Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the \"Rider Cup\" for 2018, overcoming the U.S. team with a final score of 16,5 per 10,5 per Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has had six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won the Raider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the tournament's championship crown after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Byrne reached the required 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Michelson, who performed poorly during most of the tournament, sent his first blow to the 16th hole (a pair of 3) in the water with which he lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari performed well in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching balance 5-0-0 since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spite lost categorically with 5&4 of the player in the European team, at the lowest point in the rankings – Torbørn Olezen from Denmark.
World Ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, for whom this is probably the last part of the Raider Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, an eight-part veteran at Raider Cup, became the European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing his assets to 25.5 points this year.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stand it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
“In all things, the team is most important, and I am happy to be able to help,” said the excited Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He handed the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on Sunday.
“I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play,” Ram said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his total balance of Raider Cup was already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 major titles – an indicator he only gave Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-class golf in all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furrick said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one time this morning we pressed the team of Europe.
There was a fight.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Association of Professional Golfers and our Raider Cup Committee, and look forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't keep your opponent's hat off.
We were just outplayed.
