I'm not always right.

Tom was gone before I could get here.
Tell us a story about ghosts!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more at the same time.

That must have been hard.
Your wish is my command.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.

She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I was told nothing.
The fire spread to the neighboring building before the firefighters arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary did.
I thought this would happen months ago.

And it's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.

No doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
You've grown fat real fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I do a lot of things at the same time.
Nobody's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to a party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let the imagination go.
All right, how about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go in that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary made a mistake about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How long has it been since I last saw you?
If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a mellow for the soul.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your silly business.

Tell me why you did it.
Italy is located in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends teased her.
You have the right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work more.
Why are you being so paranoid?
Tom was going through a room, couldn't calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how that's possible.
Santa lives in the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please, go.

You chose a nice one.
Look how big it is!

Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends teased her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna be here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
She can't be bribed.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll let you know.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic fingertips, creating music that's very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds broke a lot of branches off the trees last night.

In order to join the choir, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom took a nap.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
You're not done yet?
You're very uneducated.
He makes a good living.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.

I'm eating here.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of plans for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake?
I was in school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stunning, insensitive children can sometimes grow up in sociopaths.
I'd like him to be at your place.

You're different.
She has an unknown hatred of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
What time can you be here?
The monks were able to play tennis in monasteries.
Nobody trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
The game can be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
Driving to work from an hour and a half of the time.
It's the right thing to do.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the storage unit.

I'm natural.
I turned around.
I completely forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
Do you drink coffee?
Some of us think that such views are pure madness.
It works.
Someone might get hurt.
Tom didn't write a single letter to Mary until she was here.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to handle this job.
We all know Tom's guilty.
She's Chinese.
I don't like vodka.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I care more about you than I care about the future of Japan.
I couldn't help but feel sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I've been running to the skin.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points in the math exam.
The worst headaches are caused by poorly understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Look into this.
What's your name?
They try.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake, isn't it?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom's cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you distinguish silver from tin?
Hands up!
I don't exercise as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She does not speak English, let alone French.
It's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.

She's a teacher.
Without water, it is impossible to live.
I played the piano a long time ago, so I still know a little bit.
Is this your cup or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
We're finally there!
He's in good hands.
He told himself he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The teacher’s statement is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to exercise.
I love you!
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I made a contribution.
Is it true that Tom can't read or write?
I can read German, but I can't say that.
That doesn't look like you.
She has achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Madness crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This isn't a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come on, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
It's like I don't know that!
Let's not talk about this right now.
Have fun.
Time to part.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The meeting executive is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What is this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss the options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
I looked like a miracle.
It was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go and look.
Some of us hate it.
“This came for you,” he said, “but do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you the pictures of Epldzek’s brother, “Yes,” and then she told you to write a review of Mac’s physical appearance, “Yes,” “Then she sent criticism to Mecca,” “Yes,” “What you told her you had learned from it,” “I realized that Phillips’s screwdriver was convincing, but not misleading; and that Reritati was charging hard for things I thought he should do as a friend.”
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I don't want to take any more of your time.
I'm only going to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
“Did he explain it?” he said.
Not every lamp is magical.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom will wait.
What's going to happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students did not know how to respond.
Shame on you.
I'm not a night bird.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
Good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who's supposed to do it.
Tom will call.
He lit the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I understand that Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth to what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your bitching.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have cleaved and the knight fell off the horse.
I didn't forget.
There are islands on the sea.
I'm currently looking into that.
The mini-skirts are modern again.
What are we really looking for?
She has achieved her goal.
Tom can do as he will, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed some money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn’t understand much of what they said to each other.
This medication will ease your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
It depends on Starbucks coffee.
The book is on the table.
The two sides will make speeches this week.
I plan on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Cardboard's stronger than paper.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
Fadil changed his mind.
I've never noticed that before.
It's happening.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw a cat.
I'm in the cast.
Mom just went shopping.
It's hers, isn't it?
I'm proud of you.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That needs help.
Defend yourselves.

Tell me about your teacher.

Maybe she has other plans?
This is not a sentence.
I'll see you next time.
The patient is exhaled.
Thank you all for that.

If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is at the same time beautiful and stimulates our learning.

Life is short.
What was I supposed to do?
Why do you think Tom would do that?
They'll know.

I think we're lucky.
Don't talk.
Is French learning in your school?
Come and have a drink with me.

It usually works.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked my bike.
Now a word from our sponsor.
I'm not happy with the situation at all.

It's time to go to sleep.
Tom is very intelligent.
Can I replace this?

That's better now than it used to be.
Tom and Mary differ as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to fulfill and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One such desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become completely sick of eternal life, and would long for death.
Water is liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.

I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
Here's the news.
No one really wants us.

Be nice.
Look around!

No, that's all.
Come to my house.

I'll live in Cambodia.
How long will you be angry and yelling at us?
Please stop here.
How important is that?

If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm getting used to it already.
It's not that bad.
She seems to have been offended by what he told her.

I wish that had occurred to me.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I'm gonna finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself, it's all these disastrous questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
The weekend's here.
I'll be back next week.
He looks uncomfortable.
What have you both done?
I really want to see her.
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He started yelling.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a little.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this one?

Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much harder than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car by myself.
One language is never enough.

I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not getting into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out a thicker ending.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's not even.
Everything's fine with me.
It's clear that Tom is ill.
I started learning English when I was 12. I was interested in languages at the time, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; therefore, it is time to learn Latin.

Get down!
Tom couldn't handle it.
Anything you can remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
That's not something to worry about.
I understand they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just pathetic.

No free lunch.
And what if I'm gay?
Anyway, he'll be there for sure.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
What's your name?
I understand.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm getting paid.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be done soon.
He learns by doing.
You'll never walk alone.

We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't object to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I'm hungry for all this running.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of that word.
The spider's got me naked.
Talk about others so they'd like to talk about you!

Are you ready?
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
Somehow we'll go through the jungle.

It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Well, that's it, that's it.

Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.

Don't be sore.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.

He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late for the accident.
For breakfast, I always eat fruits and oat flakes.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom has made it clear he doesn't want to work for us.
I am happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the quality of the water is checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it’s really hard for people to pay attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a lot of nothingness.
Do you consent?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in very long.
That story tells us interesting facts.
\"Yes, orange juice, please,\" said Mike.
I'm not coming with you.
Be careful.
Would you mind if I cut you off for a second?
I hate science.
The students did not know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He's got two cars.
If you don't mind, they won't bother you either.
Good intentions are important.
I've already thought about it.
Men remain children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking around.
Where is the beach?
You want to know something in particular?
Welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interactive is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I don't know.
Tom was seriously injured in an accident.
Two-thirds of the students were in a meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom told me you were cool.
She received four emails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do it?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Did you see my dog?
Tom told me he was going to do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters consider Mary to be the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
She's back from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What's going to happen now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make way.
Tom is also well known in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is the time of snow.
Under what name?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's gonna come with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
The way it came, the way it went.
Give him some time.
Who waits, waits.
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been separated.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined it thoroughly.
At that point, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
It's artificial tears.
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read it?
Try again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
They say a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he slept heavily.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought about it.
A childhood illness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation, it is possible that in the future there will be evidence to support it.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
That's not what you'd like.
I'm gonna have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom double-parked.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you going to do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to protect the moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is a creator.
Tom signed the account.
There are islands on the sea.
I've never had any trouble sleeping.
Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went out for a walk.
Any other options?
The amount for the work done and the interest on the invested capital were several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I have to drink something.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Today's a nice day.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you doing these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in Southeast Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I'll send a letter to my brother who lives in Sappora.
The politician had sticky fingers, because 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a teacher.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom shut down the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man's a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, it's not his.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Denmark give him money.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left leg today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom is on the floor.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It's a typical Gothic church.
It was a presentation to the public.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do this.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
Europeans gained advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me Tom wasn't doing what he needed to do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom drove the flies away.
He stopped smoking abruptly.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to disprove what she said.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There's a cup on the table.
That makes me very angry.
Is there still light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
I wish that had occurred to me.
I'm drinking milk.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw the cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
I have no idea what was going on in his head, so he can reject such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried it.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom's strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
All right, how about you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do it.
Where are you from?
I made a promise.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a liar.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmund Dantes, having become a victim of the conspiracy, he was convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French is bullshit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're not as rich as we'd like to be.
It sucks.
Can you tell Tom I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom's thinking the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
One foot is in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy as hell.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your letter earlier.
Don't drink water from a dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I've been reformed.
All the songs I've been singing to you today I've written.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I even slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who is your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks a lot different from what it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why are rabbit ears so big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to speak to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to deal with things on the go.
You're working too hard.
This one's so cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I was just enjoying it.
You can trust that to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Cade.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
Sorry, I was late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this piece.
It's five o'clock in the morning in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's so cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't that much fun.
That's a very big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
This is not taught at school.
Is it clean?
I don't want to get out tonight.
“Do you think, ‘Yes, I will?’
Get out of there.
Fish can't live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two flowers.
Move it!
Please wait a little longer.
I'm not going to do it!
I'm tired of fighting.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
All of it!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What was your first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get along.
I just want to get out of the way.
Dania continued to follow Fadil's example.
Many words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let that chance get away with you.
What time do you eat breakfast?
Be careful.
She's in her first year of college.
I was looking for grape juice.
I've been thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Because of the bad weather, the plane was late.
Can I take your dictionary?
My fluent language knowledge is enough for many situations, but not for expressing my often contradictory emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a teacher.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a shake of the heart.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you for being anxious.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
Great!
I'm naked.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's strange that the mailman hasn't arrived yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How do we prevent this from happening?
His novels are popular among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm about to buy a boat.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
What do you call “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Have you ever received a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We gotta go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His misfortune taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go?
Why?
The storm should have no effect on our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the internet.
She tried it.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk around.
Like most eighteen-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote many musical works for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right thigh bone in a cycling accident Sunday in France.
Where there's a lot of grandmothers, they're skinny kids.
Tom's tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just cream on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were amazing.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are off.
Are you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a suck.
Don't move!
The incident was filmed by an observer.
Did I drop that?
Are you happy?
This is the dumbest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by appearance.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the destra side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a beautiful country.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom can have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
The violent criminals were often bullys in childhood.
I want you to introduce me to Tom.
After a long discussion, at the end of the day I was making things happen.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to see me yesterday for dinner.
Look how big it is!
That's the truth.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's out of it.
Tom interfered with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
The termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You failed me.
You should not judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
What is this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he would not tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans, then?
The kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
Um, I spoke to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a rather long history.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and broke up a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
The first phase is over.
You will be known.
He's got a lot of money, even too much money.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was certain of himself.
Sit down for a second, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French learning in your school?
It can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna recover.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I can't tell the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to not liking anyone.
The brakes are scribbling.
Find Tom.
You have made me really proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like beans.
I'm a little worried now.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow will be a good time.
Maria's on her ass.
Let's sit down.
Come and look at this.
Tom really looks familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I give up.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary had sent him.
Go swim with Tom.
It's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffoner isn't complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet here?
Happy Easter!
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing to be done but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked his whole life.
Die!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need my watch fixed.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the day I married her.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
I had lunch at a speed.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
I need you to leave a message with Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom has family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never showed up on time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure she's a pilot of the Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why do you do that if I may ask?
The deer is faster than the stronger.
People used to write books with typewriters.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Maria learn how to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope not.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
Take this.
How barbarous!
What's tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I look forward to your letter.
When the cat is gone, the mice are watering.
We need that from Tom.
Japan is ruled by the Emperor and the King of Spain.
It's Ali's book.
Shall we see Tom again?
The world was a separate edge of the nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
But it's all quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order, please?
What does he do?
Otherwise, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you set an example?
I'm not going to Busto with you this weekend.
He stole a very valuable diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a suck.
It's like old times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That doesn't look like you.
She's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.
Tom was hospitalized.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like hard-boiled people.
Sitting all day is bad for you.
The rainy season begins in June.
You always do.
That's perfectly normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear anything?
He's got two cars.
Tom will probably still be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
I can't see, I can't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Tom was totally drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
That house belongs to him.
My father listens to classical music.
Who?
How many people live on Earth?
I'm a little worried now.
Come back anytime.
We're from Russia.
So be it.
Which I should be doing my free time.
We need to keep working.
We had a terrible fight.
Who ate the last donut?
Are you free tonight?
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
You don't speak English.
They shook hands.
They recognized Tom.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you don't know anything about.
I'm afraid of death.
Don't run.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom's my older brother.
One man has been arrested and charged with the deliberate murder of 25-year-old Maria Thompson.
Come on, you two.
The film was inspired by the novel of the same title.
Peter loves Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
I don't want to be cruel.
Are you free tonight?
Do you have time to help me?
This is clear in itself.
Tom's pissed.
Tom will make an effort to get there in time.
Tom says I'm too aggressive.
What does that mean?
We'll never know the reason.
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
Tom's bored.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.

This is a book.
At this stage of world history, in America there is not one such thing as an independent press. You know this and I know it. There is not one who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, he would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I get my salary regularly to keep my honest opinion out of the newspaper I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks, would find himself out, on the street, looking for some other job. If I allowed my real opinion to appear in only one edition of the newspaper for which I work, I would get fired from work in less than 24 hours. The job of journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie, to slander, to slander, to invest a monster in front of whose feet lies, to sell this country and its people for their daily portion of bread. You know this as well as I know it, and then we do not cure any other innocent journalist. Our talents are our talents, our talents are our talents, and our talents are our talents.
I'm not worried at all.

Silk is expensive.
What are you gonna do today?
I'd rather not be involved at this stage, thank you.
It only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
Only I can do it here.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're going out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Taxi's expensive.
Open it.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.

I have an old bike.
Did you wash the dishes?
He didn't come to the last meeting.
Morning!
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
Your secret is safe with us.
Am I wrong?
You need a hobby.
I assumed you were busy.
At the next intersection turn right.
I told you it didn't work.
You, too, Brutus?
Are you dyslexic?
I wish I'd known.
I often borrow books from Tom.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared in advance.
I don't count on that.
I don't know what that is.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
He's poor, but he's too proud to ask for help.
“Who’s in the car, Mary?”
They gave water to their horses.
I got off at the wrong bus station.
I'll give you everything you want.

I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Change your clothes.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
He dressed like a woman.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You shouldn't have sent that email.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your husband left you?
Can you prove it?
Dead end.
It’s easy to write this pen.
Tom called his hamster Cookie.
Are you ready for more?
Don’t change your mind so often.
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I don't like to learn in this heat.
I'd rather not be involved in that right now.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
There's nothing to do in this village.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?

He is a man of experience.

There's no point in waiting.
The connection between the personality and the blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
The cat came out under the table.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
Your house is big.
If you spend a lot of time in there, you can practice lifting your knees as high as you can while you walk or walk in the place.
You're all for me.
I want to get married.
Hold my backpack.
I did check some stuff.
Tom knew Mary didn't love him.
I'm not singing.
It was love at first sight.
I'd like to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Many young Romans went to Greece.

I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
I want a sword like this!
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
Tom still seems surprised.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up like that.
He soon recovered from shock.
I'll give you what you want.
This is pure escapism.
Who did you write the letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Karin is Austrian.
Does this mean you no longer love me?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm as tough as I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
You're sad.
Tom bought the paper and read it on the train.
Focus your camera on the flower.
I won't be home next week.
As a child, I visited him often on Sundays.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be OK.
What do you call it?
Welcome back.
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me right now.
There's no policy set.
Write down what I say.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Redheads drive me crazy!
Do you love your mother?
He finally met my request.
It was a huge explosion.
Tom blinked.
I didn't step outside today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you spell your name for me?
Look at this.
I have a aunt who lives in Kyoto.
She was saving her head.

Tom adopted the Russian sentence.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty extraordinary.
Tom got his shoulders down.
Bad things are going to happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I was in a state of panic.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get in there.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Look into her.
I'm very impressed.
She was dressed in red.
I should talk to my father about it.

He's always losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
My friend was shocked when I told her.
I think Tom could do it.
I'm thinking of going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are Americans really that individual?
I asked Tony one question.
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
What's your specialization?
He couldn't help laughing at her jokes.
She released the bird from the cage.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary and he couldn't handle it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.

Tell Tom I say hello.
It's very sensitive.
This is my wife Edith.
I can't be something I'm not.
She lost money, family, friends.
Now present yourself using these sentences!
My name is not “you”; it is Ricardo.
Where are we going to meet?
We need to consider every option.
I hope this never happens again.
It is likely that tomorrow it will rain.
You're driving me crazy.
You don't need my permission.
I remember everything.

It has a beautiful flower, but it does not bear fruit.

That fabric isn't from India, is it?
Who are you?

At this stage of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know this and I know it. There is not one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, he would already know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I was getting my salary regularly to keep my honest opinion out of the newspapers I am working for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks, would find yourself out, on the street, looking for some other job. If I had allowed my real opinion to appear only in one edition of the newspapers for which I work, I would have been fired from work in less than 24 hours. (...)

Sorry about the mistakes.

That's all we can do.
Are those new shoes?
Under what name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where in the hell have you been?

The mini-skirts are back in fashion.
Tell him I'm innocent.

Can you solve this problem?
Can you go faster?
Some of my friends smoke.

Who is this man?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
He likes to make a donkey out of a mosquito.
I totally disagree with that.
The boy's thin.
It's a routine thing.
He never survived the death of his son.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?

Nothing goes by my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing fine.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my kids.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read it because it was too little.

Nancy's afraid of dogs.
It won't help you if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

I've been looking for you.
A cat is not a man!
So this is how it ends?
What is this?
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
He sleeps like a baby.
I'm taking the day off.
Are you blaming me?
That's not what I like.
That broke the mood at the table yesterday.
Stay in the house.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Fuck you!
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had any trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I will not try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
