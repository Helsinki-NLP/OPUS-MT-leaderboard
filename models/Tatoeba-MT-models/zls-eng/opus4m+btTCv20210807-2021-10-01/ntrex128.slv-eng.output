Members of the Welsh congregation are concerned that they are “like Mupetka”
Some members of the assembly are horrified by the proposal to be called the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, a similar member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Valizhan.
Members of the Assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
A member of the Labour assembly said they were concerned in their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means silly, and pwp cocoa.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that their group as a whole “is not satisfied” and proposed other options.
The Welsh Conservative said that his group of “open spirit” was about changing the name, but warned that between the words MWP and Muppet there was little difference in pronunciation.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter \"w\" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter \"u\" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to present changes to the name, stated: “The final decision on possible descriptors for the members of the Assembly will of course have to be taken by the members themselves.”
By the Law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly was given the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Parliament of Valizhan.
For the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name “Well Parliament Member” or “WMP”, but in the public consultation, the most support was given to the option “MWP”.
Members of the assembly obviously propose other options, but reaching an agreement will be a difficult task for the chairman of Elin Jones, who must submit a draft amendment legislation within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the Assembly operates, including the rules on incompatibility of the function of members of the Assembly and the formation of a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\".
By voting, they want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for changing the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have been silenced as the churches in Harlem face problems.
“The older people I talked to say that sometimes there were a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today is neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People hang out differently today.
Bars are no longer a living room neighborhood where people regularly go out.”
In the Churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be back in the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with common administration (condominiums), where people who would not help shelters in the neighborhood who remained.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore the day will come quickly when all these churches will close, as it is unlikely that people who will move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that served nearby worship.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the direction of the honorable John Howard Johnson, who on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who did not want to hire or support the dark-skinned.
The fire in 1939, severely damaged the building, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to rebuild, they ordered bells to fasten.
To honor David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, he proudly called the bells “the bells for the poor.”
The expert, who had attached them in July, called them a little different: “cultural treasure” and “unreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also stressed that these are the first bells to be attached to by a dark-skinned musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he attaches to larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced at St. Martin’s church.
In the Church of St. Martin’s, a complicated story has been taking place in the last few months with architects and contractors; some have brought church laymen and others bishops.
In July, she wrote to the bishopric that she was concerned that the diocese would “try to transfer the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
A shark injures 13-year-old man while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he dived with friends when he heard a boy scream for help, and then he swam to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was only thrilled because he caught the lobster and then found that he was screaming “He bit me!”
He bit me!”
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had torn the whole key.
“I’ve all cried out to get them out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier in the area they spotted a shark, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious damage to the upper body.
For 48 hours, they disabled access from Ponto Beach Beach in Casablad to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with beauty corners as they have in wholesale stores, and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and still growing, while the sale of clothing and household appliances is declining, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and the following year in several stores if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used to use for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says they will double the offer of their beauty products on 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also receive more space in brand-like areas like Boots.
The supermarket also re-energizes its boutique offer of cosmetic products, so most vegan products are something younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened in Croydon last week in southern London, and the second will open in Sely Oak, Birmingham by the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and the daily purchase of smaller amounts of food in local stores, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO at Sainsbury’s, said retail stores would be similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount with more services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury’s group has opened Outlet Argos in hundreds of stores and also the Habitat store since buying both chains two years ago, which has increased food sales, and the acquisitions were more profitable.
The previous experiments of the supermarket to renovate their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s was engaged in a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the division of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago for $125 million sold its pharmaceutical company to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is expected to play a role in this plan, as it is expected to expand the offer of luxury skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and impression of our beauty corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be available for counseling.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs, an attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now an interesting beauty destination that poses a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is “excited” because Holly Willoughby has retired from a £11 million business.
The show star Dragons Den (Good Business) rages because TV host Holly Willoughby has retired from a £11 million business with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand of clothing and add-ons Truly.
The company has been compared to the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand.
This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby has enraged the star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones’ show, as she has withdrawn from their lucrative business with a lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when the gold girl of television on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company’s Marlow headquarters in Buckinghamshire admitted that because of her new business – worth up to £1.5 million – she no longer has enough time to devote herself to their clothing brands and add-ons to True.
The company compared the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand and predicted that it would double its assets, estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which she would spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely stunned all those involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, because the opening was so close.
“At the company’s headquarters in Marlow, there is a warehouse full of goods ready to sell.”
Experts believe that the departure of the head of the show This Morning, which was among the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
This can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years of good friends with Jones and his wife Taro Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple had a holiday together, and Jones had a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
It was a difficult conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about media criticism over comments that seem “unpresidential” to some, and a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
With his mocking “journalist” voice, Trump said:
“I didn’t give anything up.”
He stressed that Kim showed interest in the second meeting, their first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step against North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “appropriate response” to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions that continue to put pressure on it.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had brought positive results – they stopped missile testing, helped free the hostages, and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
“It can be very much presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded full scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated the island, hundreds of dead.
In eliminating the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they do not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, they have not declared a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” Sumbung said.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutop, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palou and determining whether they will allow international agencies to help.
Given that the earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the state remains completely unprepared for the rage of nature.
In Aceh, however, shelters were built after the tsunami, but on other shores this is not a common practice.
The apparent absence of the warning siren for the Tsunami in Palu was likely to have contributed to the loss of lives, although the warning was valid.
Travelling among many Indonesian islands at its best is a challenge.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help victims of the earthquake, sails towards Palu, but will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improved Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit is a problem for the Jok administration in re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes, as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge score for late alignment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, with a score in 89 minutes, saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 1st English league.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's 25-foot pass ahead of Chelsea's goal when his team was 1-0 behind him.
He put the ball on his left and launched a shot at the remote gate.
The arrow traveled high above the penitentiary to the right upper corner of the door.
The ball eventually came down through the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell to the goal.
“I simply tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always drag it as far as I can, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanta coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much anymore and simply decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in half with the hit by Belgian actor Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the wise striker handed the ball back to Mate Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
In the middle, the blacksmith quickly gave out and ran forward.
Then he did a nice job of defense, and Hazard got into the penitentiary.
Hazard overshoot the defense and shoots his left leg toward the remote gate through Liverpool's goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, in a group part of the Champions League.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 pm in London.
The death toll in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that there were many people due to Friday's magnitude 7.5 earthquake that triggered six-meter waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
The palace, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is sprinkled with ruins of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder suspect after woman was stabbed to death
Police launched an investigation into the murder after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7:55 in the Grayson Mews building on John Street Street and arrested by a 32-year-old man over suspicion of murder.
The police are calling on all those who have been in the area and have seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an initial stage, but I call on all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead Street and have seen or heard anything suspicious to come into contact with us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something in the car camera footage to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman was the resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, friends came to the scene who thought they knew a woman and asked where they found her in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are informing the women's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he ran out of words.
The residents are now told that it can take several hours before they can re-enter.
The police heard the man explain that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He kept saying, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
Many police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone who has any information asks to write on @MerPolCC to call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, stating the daily 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memory target of the \"rewriting history\" dispute
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of Puritanism.
But the Cromwell Society labeled Crick’s proposal as “stupidity” and “an attempt to re-write history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace will become a target.”
The iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell did not order or execute.
Perhaps the actions of his predecessor from the previous century will be sacrificed to the wrong Cromwell.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to 19th-century opinion and is part of a history of personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (maybe even more in the late 19th century than today) as a protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course monarchies.
Is this a completely accurate play, it is the subject of constant historical debates.
It is clear that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from a time when Lord was a protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
Killer Pig Smuggled Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a pig was attacked and killed by a farmer in a market in the southwest of China.
A man identified only by his last name “Yuan” was found dead with a slit artery and covered with blood near a pig market in the city of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig breeder is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, she and her cousin were due to travel from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pighouse with a bloody sponge.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig had crushed the farmer to death.
“Bratran’s legs were bloody and thinned,” a cousin named Wu was quoted in the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras showed Yuang coming to the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs had been shut down so they wouldn't attack anyone else while police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering serious physical injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig was squeezed by a Welsh farmer next to a tractor, but the woman was driven away by an animal.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not usually attacking, but the taste of blood can act as a “creep”.
“We’d just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
We just need to show them a sufficient amount of respect,” he said.
South-West U.S. due to remains of the Rosa hurricane comes heavy rain
According to the predictions, the hurricane Rosa moves towards colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and weakens.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
Rosa is a 1st category hurricane with wind speed of 137 km/h and is located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenie, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the low-air pressure zone is growing, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and push high tropical moisture northwards to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture, which will mix with the low-air pressure area, will create abundant precipitation in the wider southwestern area in the coming days.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, watering floods and the possibility of Earth's landslides in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of precipitation in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Floods are possible due to rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into gentle rivers, and storms will bring local suns of wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low-air pressure zone will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rainfalls above 12 mm are possible, which can lead to a smaller discharge of floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical generals will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and Monday early in the morning, and on Monday and Tuesday the rainfall will spread.
Heavy rain will spread on all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States, as the Arctic cools down and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures at short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Canas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there are 20 degrees of difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to settle and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern United States will enter warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the Northeast.
There could be 27 °C in New York on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good options for temperatures above the average for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people have seen an interesting Thursday’s testimony by Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political path continued, as television stations broke the regular program due to Friday's last-minute turn: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, that the FBI would conduct a one-day investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh was in a vignant state and tried to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a tumultuous testimony that he is 100% convinced that this did not happen.
Nielsen says more than 20.4 million people are expected to witness on Friday.
The company averaged the ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television networks.
The numbers were not immediately available for other testimonials, including PBS networks, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has a few problems with the number of viewers watching the program in offices.
To make the show easier, viewing is similar to playing the final football match or giving the American Film Academy prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads to a 5.69 million viewers in all networks, Nielsen reports.
ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS videoed on Friday morning the protestors screaming at him as he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the Justice Committee.
During the construction, for a few minutes, he took a look, which was captured live by the CNN television house.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” a woman told him.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?”
You have strength, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office made a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the door of the elevator closed.
All television networks were broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to hand over Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which was called by a minority party of Democrats.
Flake was partially persuaded to talk to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to name Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit of “playing political games”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with the British future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's arrival at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers and said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to pay the tariffs was “very absurd.”
Shooting at Wade Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to police report from Baron Rouge, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and sentenced to prison for second-degree murder charges.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said they had lost their sunglasses during the fight.
Police found sunglasses on the scene, and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police issued a statement admitting that he had shot Wade to death.
The security is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
A postcard from East Baton Rouge Parish County issued a previous report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police, for assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest, thanked the Special Unit for the Louisiana State Police Refugees, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the South University Police and the residents of the area.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for their “care and search for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-cm striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to the game.
On Friday morning, team coach LSU Will Wade said the team was “stricken” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Vulcan vomits ash on Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano, as the activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center has observed several cases of thunder and earthquake suns.
The images on social networks showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increased activity in a volcano that lies 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, dubbed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters who supported independence clashed with anti-extreme police units and thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized secession vote.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, held by anti-strength police units, covered them with eggs and metal powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later there were fights, and police officers had to use pendrekes to stop the fighting.
The supporters of independence, who cried out for several hours “without forgetting, without forgiveness,” faced protesters who supported unity and shouted, “Let Spain live!”
According to local media, 14 people were injured in the protests.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was labeled illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although the participation was low, as opponents of the secession largely boycotted the elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the region’s elections in violent clashes.
Groups supporting independence camped in front of voters overnight to prevent demonstrations and thus support state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the important, although close victories in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties supporting independence have been difficult to maintain this year’s initiative, as many of the best-known leaders in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial in detention for their role in organising a referendum and later declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a police-backed protest with his phone, explained that the protests fueled politicians on both sides.
“The tension is getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“To run in the European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested Men Who Walked Into The House With Car
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested for having hit a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at around 19:30 a.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they were also going to shoot at the car with a crossbow.
With Mengaja, Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston won
Livingston stunned the Rangers and Steven Gerrard only had to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as a club coach from Ibrox.
The shooting of Dolly Mengaj took care of the difference, as Gary Holt's team was equal to the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team thus ran out of guests in this year's championship, and next Sunday they're waiting for Hearts, leading on the scale and behind which they're behind eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his series of undefeated division to six games, and Chief Coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston has lost its chance against direct guests
Holt's team should be leading long before the hit, as they caused a number of problems with their directness to Rangers.
Scott Robinson was able to make a breakthrough, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit past the door, and Craig Hallkett shot his head over the goal.
The guests left the game to the Rangers because they knew that guests could be dangerous when they were interrupted.
And this way they also reached a key goal.
The Rangers donated a free shot to Livingston, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Menga, who shot and hit from the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had a larger possession of the ball, but the domestic defense couldn't get through and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot with his foot, and Lithgow fired a goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingston's penitentiary, but the domestics refused all the attacks, two offenses - Halkett's violation of Glenn Middleton's replacement and a hand-to-hand offense - but the judge did not decide.
“Excellent Performance” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great performance and result for Livingston.
They were all excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this path up.
The style of the game and the physique have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt must be credited with the way the team has woken up since his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and distributed a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral ready all the time.
Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although under Gerrard’s leadership they are exceptional, these standards are severely lacking.
There were no goalshoots – only once they successfully defeated the defense of the hosts – and it’s kind of a wake for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the scale.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29th), when leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and the Turkish approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the highest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 people were prevented from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters were able to get closer to seeing their president.
He also expressed his opinion to hundreds of protesters - many of them Kurds - who do not support the government of Erdogan and condemned Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to greet him in the country.
Opponent protests reflect the separation of a visitor that some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others despise as an autocrat.
Deptford Road Accident: Bicyclist Accidentally Accidented in Car Crash
In London, the cyclist fatally crashed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near a crossroads between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city at approximately 10.15 p.m. after British summertime.
The driver of the car stopped and rescuers arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred just a few months after the cyclist died in a collision in which the car driver ran off, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident.
Police have issued a statement that police are checking the identity of a man that they will be able to inform their relatives.
They set up road prisons and diverted bus lines and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six guards injured in explosion
Six prison guards were injured in an emergency in a severely protected man's prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. after British summertime and is still ongoing.
Police officers from the tornado unit were called in to take care of an emergency involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor injuries on the face on the spot.
The prison staff said: “We have called in specially trained personnel to take care of the HMP Long Lartin prison disaster.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this, and they may be behind bars even longer.”
HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
June reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called an anti-image police unit in prison to intervene in a serious riot in which personnel were attacked with billiards bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa paves the way through the southwest desert and brings the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flag Staff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa is expected to get angry over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged a good 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual rainfalls up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other regions of the South-West desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, is expected from 25 to 50 mm of precipitation, individual precipitations up to 100 mm are possible.
For areas outside the threat of sudden flooding, rain from the Rosa hurricane may be a blessing, as the region was hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as the drought is currently taking place in the south-west.
“According to the U.S. Drought Tracking Center, a good 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought,” reports Weather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of a hurricane at the highest wind speed of 137 km/h on Sunday morning, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected that the mainland in Mexico will reach with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The precipitation in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great threat to floods.
“We expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of 250 mm of rainfall,” reports Weather.com.
Orkan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and South Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger we expect from the Ross or its remains is the heavy rain in the Baja Caliphonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts, as well as earth's tides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in Excelsion Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4:00 a.m. in British summertime.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains “stable.”
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police from Avon and Somerset reported.
The police are calling on anyone who may have caught what was going on with their mobile phone to answer.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the hostility and anger” of the Democratic party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unheard tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered the hostility and anger” of a Democratic party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
In the hearing, Ford also testified about his charges.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.”
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in western Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican election participation in the mid-term elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m really trying to run,” he said.
\"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.\"
Trump says Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction mission.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a Republican party adviser told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of people are killed, the number of victims is increasing.
Authorities reported on Saturday that in an earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people died, many carried away the giant waves that pushed along the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the town of Pal, when six-meter waves hit the coast and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the danger of tsunami arose yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they became victims,” said a representative of Indonesia’s BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami did not come alone, he pulled cars, trees, houses, threw everything on the floor,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said a few people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palou.
Photos from the air published by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, curved and destroyed bridges and a water-enveloping mosque.
The earthquakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruins of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palou, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely interrupted and do not have any information from the Donggala area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are moving to affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Pal, but officials said the waves had arrived just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, it sounds like a man screaming on the top floor warns people on the street on the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collided along the coast and took away the buildings and cars with it.
In Reuters, they were unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an electrical outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
The authorities report that the military began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport was opened only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the evacuation centers in Palou on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr Dosama, members of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived safely in Pal, where employees in the courtyard in front of their premises placed a shelter from the fields, but on the way they saw many scenes of devastation.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to come to Pal.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, supplies and assistance of staff are allowed only if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still being treated as an accident at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘all right, it’s a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is no such status.”
The second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palou, friends and relatives of the missing are hesitant to hope that their nearby miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was trapped under the ruins for two days, and next to her mother's body lay.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian team of sailing parachutes, trained two missing sailing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, according to Mr. Mandagi.
“As an age in the field of paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how, in the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was circulating around the sailing parachute community, he was desperate to send messages in the WhatsApp app to competitors in Palu, who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray hook, instead of two blue ones.
“I don’t think this means the messages were delivered,” he said.
Tattoos stole $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police report, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s security officer who was charging an ATM at the Newport on the Leeve center on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement to the public.
While employed, another man “approached to the Brink’s employee security service from behind” and stole a bag of cash for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not state the exact number of participants in the event.
Anyone who has information on suspects' identities should call the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was posted on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “A creature with the official name Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it for the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano Grande, who canceled the performance for “unfortunate reasons,” said the show’s creator.
The word is shortening his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where ‘you’ means ‘you’,” West said at the beginning of this year, when he spoke about the album’s title with a radio host, Big Boy.
“I am you and I am all of you.
Kanye, which means “the only one,” I changed to Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West associate, Jay-Z, also used his name differently; with or without thought and with capital letters.
Mexico's president promises not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians just as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of blood violence against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements began operating in Latin America, 300 people were shot and killed at peaceful demonstrations in the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and provide monthly subsidies to students and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education would drag young people into criminal organizations.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds it spends on research in this area, says the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the United States does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much for the United States and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major artificial intelligence achievement will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was released this month by Houston Mifflin Harcourt, president of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranked American player of the game Othello, and was later the CEO of Microsoft Research and the chairman of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous technological competitions by the U.S. government, such as the competition in robotics organized by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when it would be next to find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States need to work hard to get state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s companies,” Lee explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the best from universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States step up efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that people with an artificial intelligence doctor should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued an Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the New Generation.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations, distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a Conservative Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of $2 billion.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million per year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide to change the name of the country in the referendum
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted to change their country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\". This would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The government concluded a deal on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubt that the participation would be at least 50 percent absent, as far as it is necessary to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was, “Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that is worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the result of the vote, which will be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities reported by 1pm.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje’s capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško issued their ballots for a referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents placed by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring a strong investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the broadcast of his ballot.
He added that the positive result would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute last Monday showed that the referendum would be attended by between 30 and 43 percent of voters, which is less than the required electoral participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma television showed 57% of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent voted in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government policy that took office last May.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City played the entire Brighton defense and hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defenses on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, to win Manchester City 2-0.
Aguero's hit in the 65th minute seemed ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentine attacker accepted the pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between three of Brighton's defensive players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
With his first touch in the penitentiary, the English attacker returned the ball to Aguera, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right of the network.
“Aguero is dealing with leg problems,” Pep Guardiola’s coach told reporters.
\"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored the goal at that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the blue blues an initial advantage in the first English league fight.
He scored in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Saney on the left.
Sane touched the ball several times, and then sent the ball to Sterling towards the remote gate.
The blue-blue striker pushed the ball into the net just before it landed past the goal.
The city will meet with Hoffenheim at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday, 12.55.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their title options
The Nationals team has dropped out of the finish line, so there is no specific reason for a new attack.
But always competing Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if the Rockies will still have the chance to play in the final, as in the Western League they have the advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
On Friday, the Rockies won 5:2 over the Nationals team provided the smallest invitation of the organizer, but they are still waiting for their first title in the division.
“Although we can’t get anything, at least we’ll be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will probably play at the highest level this year.
“Why wouldn’t you want to compete?”
Nationals have not yet released the name of the first metal player for Sunday, but it is likely that in this case, the metal Scherzer will be released.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal for the 34th time, is a metal player on Thursday and would have enough rest days by Sunday.
This season, the right-wing Washington has collected 18 victories and 7 defeats with an average of 2.53 and 300 outstrikes in 220 2/3 of the season.
Trump attends conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voting in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I’m really trying to run, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and this is happening now.
They're determined to retake power, using all possible means.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control. That’s what they want, power and control, but we won’t give it to them.”
In his words, Democrats are on a mission of “strengthening and obstructing.”
“And you could see that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, evil, low and false.”
He pointed out by name a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, which heard loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, no, wait, that was really bad body language, the worst thing I've ever seen.\"
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
Those who express their opinion are impatient.
When an activist at Momentum told me about my local party, it wasn’t even a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a series of Members of Parliament from a Labour Party who are not desirable for expressing their opinion.
My fellow Members Joan Ryan did the same because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a non-believer proposal for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
Nottingham East said Friday’s meeting “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In eight years, as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly like that.
Today, in most meetings, such a tone is not used, and the promise of a “friendly and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly obvious that different views in the Labour Party are not permissible and in each opinion it is assessed whether this is acceptable for the leadership of the client.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues I previously thought shared similar political views expected me to change my opinion and take positions I would never agree with - whether it be in the field of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks calling for non-election, condemning the politics of the environment and telling me that I shouldn’t be in a Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments intended for me are just political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not let themselves be frightened.
One of the most deplorable aspects of this period of politics is how abuse rates have become something completely common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that a Labour party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with each non-confidence proposal or change of the selection rules, the client becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep my head off and not to be so loud, and it will be “all right” with me.
But I didn't get into politics because of it.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago – the cause of this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which is why the classroom at my elementary school literally collapsed – I have tried as a local saint or government minister to advocate for better public services for those most in need.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas that I disagreed with at the moment.
I just want to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is sailing towards Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threats of non-election or political suitability will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr on top of the ladder
Two known experiments have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully fun match of the day.
Now they're at the top of the ladder and they're the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, the scale on the home side exceeded their superior defense and better exploitation of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason to please him.
“We’ve been through a lot of tests in our games so far, and we’re still invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robbie Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayra team, the opportunities have been better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute hit, converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was won in the game with the Warriors, meant a numerical superiority for Melrose, and Jason Baggott intercepted an attempt without conversion.
At the time of the offense, Climo increased the lead for Ayr before he hit half-time and then transformed a standalone attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr on break.
But Melrose very well started the second half, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt to convert Baggot reduced the gap to five points.
It was followed by a long break due to the serious damage to Ruaridh Knotto, which they carried on the stretchers, and then Ayr advanced with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
The temporary captain of Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struanhutchinson received the yellow card due to the obstacle to the climate without the ball, MacPherson reached the goal in the attack.
Climo reached points after Kyle Rowe intercepted the shooting of David Armstrong and sent winged actor Gregory Henry in the fifth host attempt.
Still Game star launches new hospitality career
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is apparently being handed over to the inn, as he is supposed to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote a script, played by Jack Jarvis along with a longtime partner in comedy by Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that after the next ninth season, Kiernan seems to be already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but the source hinted to Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to join the “flowering hospitality” in Glasgow.
“The Sea Is Ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol at the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings feature a navy blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaka to Amazon are covered with a slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coastline in a bloody dispute due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing for a resurgence of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the highest in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the international court to be received after five years of consultation on 1 October.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, is expecting a result in a positive spirit,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the international court’s decision on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia, which claims that – after decades of ongoing talks – Chile must negotiate access to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivian charismatic indigenous president, who is awaiting a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has high expectations for Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilen territory and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years they have not spoken in favor of Bolivia, but they may cost a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” she said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric has taken away all the goodwill that may have remained from the Chileans, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in discussions.
The state has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
Today, Bolivia will bring an “extreme opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the possibility to “end 139-year disagreements with each other’s benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The United States has called on them to keep their promises at a meeting between rival countries leaders in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was apparently ahead of a re-launch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the United States is mistaken if they think that continuing sanctions and opposition to the end of the Korean war will put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is careful to fasten the forecast without Pyongyang taking decisive disarmament measures first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the failure of a weapon seen by the state as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris, they unveiled the latest line of huge blankets coming to the shops with affordable brands nearby.
If you want to complete your collection of covers or completely hide from the sun, you do not have to look forward.
In their spring and summer 2019 collections, designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a collection of strange oversized covers that blinded the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
The Valentine's piece, which stood out most, was a beige hat with wide shorts decorated with feathers-like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included watermelons with expensive stones, a magic hat and even pineapple – but your heads won’t warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colourful masks have sewn lips and are more similar to the masks of Hannibal Lecter than high fashions.
One creation was similar to the equipment for diving with a breather and glasses, and the other looked like a cornette with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashionable connoisseurs predict that giant blankets will come to shops near you.
Wide hats are closely followed by \"La Bombi\", a straw hat with 60-centimetre shorts were spotted on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for the extremely impractical hat that flooded the social networks, after the fashion runway, sent another large creation – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuits she wore.
The raffia bag in the burnt orange color, encased with ruffia reeds and a white leather handle, was a central piece of the La Riviera collection for spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of the famous Luke Armitage told FYROM: “I expect big beach hats and bags to arrive at the shops for the next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many extras.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is key to global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams, which are further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, a chosen career path and a city they have as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school program, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the conversation is impressed with his memory.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, his words are impressed with his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results of recent exams show that the languages are at the top of the scale with the highest performance rates in independent schools.
68% of students who learned a foreign language achieved an excellent rating.
The data collected in 74 schools by members of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students achieved excellent grades in Mandarin, and an excellent score was also given 72 percent of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective subject in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere are treated the same as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that for the reasons why employers are struggling to fill jobs, 17% could be attributed to a lack of language knowledge.
That is why language knowledge is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career path.
In the future job opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, regardless of the career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly agree with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
A 2013 survey by YouGov, which included more than 4,000 adults in the UK, showed that 75% of people did not speak foreign languages well enough to be able to speak, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that is 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field in independent schools.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it is not possible to deny that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien just faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut Sunday in San Diego
For fans looking forward to LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
The official spokesman for Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers matches before the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to compete before the season,” he said.
Trump's Western Virginia Congress on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a series of conventions in his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned conventions in the coming week, including stops in its favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a seat in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
At what time will Trump’s Western Virginia assembly take place and where will it be viewed online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. Eastern time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia convention live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, which is why the Senate's confirmation is expected to be postponed for a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of conventions is to help Republicans, who are waiting for important elections in November, to get a new start.
That is why, in the campaign of President Trump, these five conventions “incite volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
“Congress surveillance is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many countries as he can in the hard season as he can,” Trump’s campaign representative, who does not want to be named, told Reuters.
According to West Virginia MetroNews, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could also attend today’s Wesbanco Arena convention in Wheeling, which would attract interest from Pittsburgh’s media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he won more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is falling behind in public polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s a bad sign that the president has to come and ‘lift’ him in public polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team still wants to win and keeps hope from Sunday’s single matches
After three one-sided games, it may have been Saturday afternoon duels of two duo (foursome) that needed this year’s Ryder Cup.
The fluctuating flutter is a completely fictional sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where did the flutters go now?
“They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so it’s probably a new start for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, because it leads by four points, and another 12 can get them.
But Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have wind in their sails, and, among other things, have been stimulated by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each has won three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the initial blow to the green and set a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to get louder and led to a decisive blow, when Thomas and Thomas, after falling behind with two points, were equalized in the fourth game.
The blow that brought them victory at the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes the American team still has options.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players now.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange, but charming two Europes have won four points out of four and are infallible.
The two Molliwood were the only ones who did not hit the bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way energy flows between them and the noisy audience confirm that they are those players who will need to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal Europe’s possible victory than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Maybe both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergia Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game paired with Alex Noren.
Due to bugs and two double bugs on the first nine holes, the Spanish and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they found no way out.
On Saturday, the players won’t be able to help.
Games with four balls and two duels are an exception to follow closely due to the communication between couples, the tips they give themselves, the tips they do not give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the duels of the two have shown that the U.S. team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a nice advantage after Saturday's four-ball games and two-two duels lead with 10:6 against the United States.
An excellent couple, made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave his best and with two victories over Tiger Woods and at Le Golf National, he traded four points.
Thomas Björn's European team, who sought to win the trophy she lost in Hazeltin two years ago, won four balls in the morning overtook the American team who was wrong and led in a 3-1 series.
The U.S. team fought better in two matches, where they won two games, but they couldn’t make up for it.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four consecutive points, while with Molinari (a couple named “Molliwood”) after the sensational end of the week, only the second couple to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they proved again and more convincingly beat the spent Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 of the 29 games in four-ball matches and two-two duels, seven of which in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning four-ball games, returned for the duels of two duels and, in a pair with Henry Stanson, 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the team of Europe.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new standard for Americans on Saturday.
With 2 and 1 they won decisively against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 and 3 in the duel of two matches, losing the first two holes.
Just once in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned after four points behind individual duels, although Fury's team only needs equalization to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday's counterattack may seem like too much for her.
North Korea: “Without confidence, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves”
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that further enforcement of sanctions is causing increasing mistrust in the United States and that North Korea will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had taken many “important measures in good faith” in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, undermining the city for nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“We don’t see the U.S. response,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in state security and under such conditions we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s famous complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, which would reward North Korea for taking gradual action, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri linked to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place on June 12 in Singapore.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said Pyongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also not given in to calls for the release of strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“The United States insists that we first need to disarm ourselves nuclearly, and that they step down pressures with sanctions to force them to achieve their goals, and they even object to declaring the end of the war,” Ri said.
“When he thinks sanctions could get us on our knees, it’s the unrealistic hope of people who don’t know us at all.
The problem is that further enforcement of sanctions further deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president pointed out at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
The minister instead stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae In, which took place over the past five months, and added: “If the problem of nuclear disarmament were to be discussed with South Korea rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have agreed to such a deadlock.”
However, the tone of Rio’s speech was quite different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the attack on the continental part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” called Trump Kim a “rocket husband” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage to take disarmament measures, but said he was still facing a lot of work and that sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is disarmed nuclearly.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no scheduled timeframe, saying: “It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “The imposition of sanctions on the Security Council must continue without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verifiable state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously accepted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent funding of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rio at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said Pyongyang would visit again next month for preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had taken place, and North Korea criticized him in a few hours, saying his demands were “gangster”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to tear down the missile testing station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States adopts “appropriate measures”.
Moon is said to have told Kim that the “appropriate measures” meant the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, as well as measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The aim of this year’s Harvard University course is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course they want to fight against the growing mastic culture of “all-night” learning in which power is accumulated with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best university often do not know the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, has designed a course that after his first such kind in the United States.
He decided to pursue such a course after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
After the end of the lecture, the girl approached him and said, “Why do I know this only now that I’m in the last year?”
She said no one's ever told her how important sleep is, and the Daily Telegraph told The Daily Telegraph that it surprised him.
This year’s course is about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the University’s Executive Director of Health Services, says that they decided to take such a course when they found that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of the door of a student’s home, where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports slippers and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In the second section, participants learn that a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression and cancer.
The student settlement map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to get acquainted with these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by smoking cigarettes,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present at the “sustaining all-night learning”. It also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, are a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion and worry. Thus, they can also avoid weight gain – the brain due to lack of sleep should go into a mode of hunger, making students constantly hungry.
19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler form a course. Last year, he attended one of the professor's lectures during his first year at Harvard.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue a course throughout the student village.
He hopes that in the next phase of graduate students will be able to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up an alarm clock for sleep as well as waking up. He also wants to draw attention to the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause the imbalance of the circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit sank the hopes of Gerrard's team
The Rangers again defeated in the guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston sentenced Steven Gerrard's announced team to a 1-0 defeat.
The team from Ibrox was hunting their first guest victory after February's predominance at St. John's Stadium 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated her second in 18 games since Gerrard led the team, leaving his team behind 8 points for the lead team of the Scottish league.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected range of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
The Rangers have fallen to a very common place, and Livingston has advanced to third place, but the Hibernian team has fallen behind the goal gap.
Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when, according to a report, an object landed on the site of the guest team's fans.
Gerrard, on a crew that easily defeated Ayr and placed in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt held on to the verified Livingston eleven, who had taken away the Hearts team a week before, and was undoubtedly impressed by how his escaped team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga first briefly found Scott Pittman, then went to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder was inaccurate and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs was then reached by Captain Craig Halkett, but the balls then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after the fight with Steven Lawless, after 15 minutes of the match, a criminal shot would have to be given, but Judge Steven Thomson's demands were crushed by Colombia in the mud.
Rangers were able to assemble only two shots at the goal in the first half, but not a head shot sent to the goal by Lassan Coulibaly, nor the flamboyant Ovie Ejari ball, did not pose any danger to the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already well deserved for his perseverance.
Rangers failed to cash another Jacobs sequel with a long pass.
Scott Arfield did not react when he brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi for the easy conclusion of the attack.
Gerrard took action and replaced Coulibaly with wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately appeared with Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of several podiums ahead of the goal.
Holt's team could further increase the lead towards the end of the match, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow after passing from an angle was inaccurate.
In the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the opportunity to shoot after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not recognize him.
Almanah: inventor of Geiger's counter
On September 30, 1882, on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm \"Hans\" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
He became a permanent in the scientific world, and he also gained his place in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboy scientists:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you get your headsets on, you can hear the effect it has on atoms of radioactiveity in materials.”
Evans: “Madonca, now they are really advertising!”
\"Hans\" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize attacking cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and destroy the attacking cells.
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to recognize the attacking cells
This method involves obtaining immune cells of the patient, which are then modified in the laboratory
After that, they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize the ovaries, the cancer on the ovaries disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the immune cells of the patient that they change in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of a number of forms of cancer, and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Research Institute from Bethesda, Maryland said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promoting the growth of several different types of cancers” including breast, ovaries, lungs and colon cancer.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells of patients who are “leuked” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of the type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after performing on SNL, performed a protrump point with the inscription MAGA on the drop.
The community was not thrilled.
Kanye West was shot in a studio at Saturday Night Live after a strange point, during which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the presidency.
After his third performance, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore the caption “Make America Great Again,” West began an attack on Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I’m talking to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I were to worry about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” she says.
This time, SNL began parodying with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood actor deluded himself from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The recording of West's monologue was not broadcast, but was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of it from West.
West also complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems in the background because of the caption.
“They were on the stage for me.
They said, “Don’t go on the stage with that hat.”
I was harassed!
“They say I’m lost,” he said.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to hope for “Superman’s robe, because that means that no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
His comments were prepared by the audience at least twice to whistle, and members of the SNL team were in obvious embarrassment, and someone told Vanity: “There was a deadly silence in the studio.”
West was last minute invited by a goat replacement for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before that.
West has caused a lot of wonders already with a video for the song “I Love It”, where he wore the costume of a mineral water bottle of the perrier brand.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: “One of the most courageous souls: Thank you for standing up to heaven.”
Karen Hunter tweeted that West is “what it is, and that’s fine.”
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying his music, clothing, or supporting his “art”), who in my opinion welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and from now on will be “a creature formally known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name. He's already done this before Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His residential colleague, Snoop Dogg, was once called Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was an Artist, once known as Prince.

The star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington starred sharply against toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his swing of the match in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval coloured fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old actor who has strongly condemned the stereotype of a masculine hero says that because of the appearance of such roles on the screens, young boys often feel that respect can be earned only by hardness.
Keith told The Sunday Times Culture magazine that something had gone wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #JaTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married a 31-year-old co-star from the Rose Leslie Game of Thrones, admitted to having strong beliefs about this topic.
“I’m wondering where we made a mistake when the masculinity comes to me right now,” he said.
“What did we teach men during growing up about the problems we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the depiction of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do they teach us on television and on the streets that young boys feel they have to choose exactly this certain fabric of masculinity?
I think one of the important questions of our time is how can we change this?
“It was something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in filming any pre-story or continuation of the Game of Thrones, because he “find with the battlefields and horses.”
In November, Keith will star in the lead role of the new performance of True West Sam Shepherd, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of the Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose in the filming.
“Because of this series, I met my wife, so she kind of gave me my future family and my life from here on,” he said.
Rose starred in the fantasy series Emmy, Ygritte, the love-chosen character of Keith Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
According to Chinese health officials, however, the number of people infected with HIV has decreased to almost nothing since the June conference in June.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 per year in China.
The transmission of HIV with sexual intercourse into the Chinese community of LGBT is a very pressing problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
As conservative values remain in place in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of its efforts to solve the problem, the Chinese government has promised general access to medicines for the treatment of HIV.
Maxine Waters denies staff has released information on Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her staff had released information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A Los Angeles Democrat said these allegations come from individuals and websites of the far right.
“Leaders, lies, and even more unacceptable lies,” Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
This data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate session on sexual harassment allegations of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators had finished questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate, state that through the IP address it is possible to identify a source of publication that is supposed to have been linked to Senator Waters’ office and conclude that the information was posted by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are a completely false and pure lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are at risk for these false accusations, are in no way responsible for leaking this data.
These unfounded accusations are a completely untrue and pure lie.”
The statement by Senator Waters quickly came across criticism online, including by a former White House press official, Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial of the branch of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It may not be the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
He has to stay calm.”
Fleicher compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes for the city of Waters in the mid-term elections, called Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her cabinet had informed “the appropriate institutions and law enforcement authorities about these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
Searching for hints at Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and also applies to the revival of action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003 titled Johnny English and the continuation in 2011 titled Johnny English 2.
Will it be a fun satire about how miserable we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incomprehensible Johnny English with the eyes cast and unusual Grimms gets permission to re-mix the vernaculars; his name already indicates that it is a comical character created for the cinematic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an awkward secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's little bit, and the little one who contributed the last note to Chariots of Fire at the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012.
It is also based on a traveler and an international mystery player played by Atkinson once in the now-forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving behind the real chaos.
In the latest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English approached him in a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves had a short time to deal with his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially because “serious” films, such as 007 or Mission impossible now offer comic elements without bad conscience.
It looks like humor is meant for children and not so many adult viewers, and therefore for me, the rejection of the events of Johnny English is not as innovative and directed as Atkinson's silent sketch in the role of Mr. Bean.
It is now obvious that the UK is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the online network of British top secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing a major problem to a competent agent represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the point of a break for the prime minister, a pomposal figure who has already experienced a break in political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has made an effort to play the role of the alleged Theresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the scenario that could help her.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies are exposed, so she has to opt for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school who informally teaches how to act undercover: here the screenwriters hit, as English performs some kind of spy “rock academy”.
English is taken to the Whitehall for an emergency meeting where he meets with longtime co-worker Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bowe is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotyped sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create even more trouble in the name of her Majesty's secret service, and they meet Fatalka Ophelio Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bow begin their odyssey: dressed in a waiter-in-charged fire in a French restaurant, create chaos when overtook on the board of the Volt’s yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality to get familiar with the interior of Volt’s house, it manages to create a general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energeticness it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think here: Is the British film Atkinson capable of playing a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies planning a four-day working week for the British, and would receive a five-day working week payment.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five-day payment.
The client wants the company’s leaders to spill the savings that companies create due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to workers and provide them with an extra day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say the idea corresponds to the client's economic plan and plans to place the country on the side of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-week worker is a goal that we will strive to achieve through a client’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the client.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as it supported the Green Party in its 2017 campaign for a four-week working week.
This goal is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour party official said: “The four-week working week is not a party policy and the party is not thinking about it.”
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to tear off the power of “discriminate directors” and “winners” in utility companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadows also mean that current stakeholders in water companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour party could impose “rejections” on the basis of alleged injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the board of directors and the introduction of equity funds, which would transfer 10% of the share in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, in the 60 Minutes show, discussed whether their opinion could be altered by the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, carried out by the FBI, delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that they submitted on Sunday, a \"60 Minutes\" correspondent asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change its mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began.
When I called him when this accusation appeared, I asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, unshakable, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice appears to be carved into a stone.
“I created my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
\"And none of those she named could confirm it.
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event featuring a truly exceptional kind of stars and having the same extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held this time for the seventh time, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy the Grand Trotto of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to evoke interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens’ Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Citizens’ Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to the world’s leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which still has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another example of so-called “cliktivism” – creating the belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation of signing an online petition or communicating a tweet?
The Global Citizen Movement says that more than 19 million “acts” of its supporters have been recorded in the pursuit of a range of different goals since 2011.
He says these actions have helped world leaders to accept commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Earlier in 2018, the group stated that the result of its actions should be 390 commitments and messages, which have already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision makers committed to “help children realize their full potential,” which Rwanda promised $35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens movement.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition into historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, the Ambassador of the Food Power Partnership, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said the government, following more than 5,000 actions that the UK has called for to improve the diet of mothers and children, said it would co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children by dietary measures.
In response to one of the most common questions on the website, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty,”
The Global Citizen movement responded: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, as we are stronger together.
Some of the performers that will perform at this year's New York event include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe, and the event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy, the U.S. Interior Ministry, to block Russian energy exports.
According to the Washington Examiner newspaper, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they market it in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can handle this. The Navy ensures that our shipping routes are open and block them if necessary, thus preventing Russian energy from flowing into the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group called the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic possibility is more or less of an impact on and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “a pony who knows one trick”, with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when the Trump administration sought to increase exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, where it was supposed to undermine Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials from the Trump government, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which said Berlin was a “ hostage” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas pipeline capacity at 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for implementing pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers,” Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany has rejected and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The interference of a third country in our energy supply means a big problem for me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “exactly examine” her candidacy in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “exactly examine” her candidacy for the U.S. president after the midterm elections.
In a city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” the official said in a statement.
“After November 6th, I will examine my candidacy for the President accurately.”
At a meeting in the city house, Warren built President Donald Trump because “this country is supposed to lead the wrong way”.
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I am terribly concerned,” she said.
Warren has criticized Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh several times.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said: “Of course, before the election, we need an FBI investigation –
A poll released on Thursday showed that most of its own voters feel that Warren should not compete for the presidency in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Ban Boston Globe, the senator should not run for president, eighty-five percent of “probably” voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that it had more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of respondents supporting it, and 48% of respondents opposed it.
Other senior Democrats, who would be eligible for the 2020 election, are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions a post-traumatic stress disorder at a rally in support of Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son experiences after his return connects me with other families dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain extent of injury that our soldiers return to,” said the crowd at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's arrest was labeled an \"elephant in the salon\" and said that her son and other war veterans were returning slightly changed, solidified, wondering where the respect for what was being given to the country by the teammates and aircraft and all the other members of the army.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wassilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence with assaulting a woman, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a wine state, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wassilla police station.
18 states and the District of Colombia support rejection of new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support the legal rejection of a new U.S. policy that denies victims of gang violence or domestic violence their right to asylum.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the said district filled the court lobby on Friday to support legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace’s lawsuit against Sessions, which was not made public by the American Civil Liberties Alliance against federal policy, has not been published.
She said her partner and “his violent sons, members of the crowd,” had been abused, but the U.S. authorities rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace, Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications in the United States come, have described them as countries that are constantly facing problems with crowds and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new U.S. asylum policy annulled the decision of the Immigrant Appeals Committee, which allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “disdains decades of state, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court said.
State prosecutors further stated in the request that a policy denying immigrants the right to enter harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palou has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are taking place to find survivors.
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusum when she comforted her hot boy at an evacuation center in the devasted town of Pal.
“Saviours are constantly reaching the bodies.
“There’s no clean water.”
It seemed like the townspeople, returning to the destroyed homes that were beating through the wetlands and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, rested outside a military hospital in Palou, where patients were treated outdoors for constant strong post-traumatic suns.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was housed with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to get rid of it.
I think I was squeezed against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then it was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “harassing” with “propaganda ads”
A week after the publication of a four-sided advertisement by the official Chinese newspaper in the U.S. daily, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused the U.S. press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week mentioned the paid addition of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6th U.S. congressional election, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials have described the allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. federal election as a new phase in Washington’s increasingly intense effort to push China.
While foreign governments find advertising to promote trade commonplace, Beijing and Washington are currently complicated in an increasingly intense trade war, in which they exchange strikes by introducing tariffs on imported products.
China's return tariffs at the beginning of the trade war are expected to affect exporters in federal states, such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had been hit by U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstadt wrote in a column in Sunday's edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, \"now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.\"
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the valued American tradition of free speech and the free press to publish a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstadt wrote.
“On the other hand, you’ll see only a few other opinions in Beijing’s newspapers and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about the worrisome Chinese economic path, as the generals are strictly controlled by China’s Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused an offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose polling before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming mid-term elections with the loss of votes.
The sentiments here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue with the vote.
This cannot be brought back,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University College of Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington Times.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate corridor, when Republicans overseeing the judicial committee decided to further support Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the news portal Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will exceed all limits,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they’re strong now, and that’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among the undefined voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who don’t like the president, but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” NBC News reported earlier this week, said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council.
“It’s not just a vote of the world or a final vote or a Kavanaugh oath; it’s also a way for Republicans to deal with it and how Ford was treated,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priority Group, which supports Democrats in the election.
The Americans seem to be somewhat divided between believing more in Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a little more support from the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh.
38% said they thought Kavanaugh was probably lying about the case, and only 30 percent said about Ford.
After the pressure of FBA, FBA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Last week, in front of the Senate court, Ford swore an oath that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, attacked her in a vignant state.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her sex when they were at the party together during their studies at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the world’s internet plans to launch a new internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is opening a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupta’s goal was “to conquer the world”.
“We decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create a “private storage storage” or POD
This may include contact details, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The peculiarity of the personal storage of data is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls this “personal authorization with data”.
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of a company is to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow access to the Solid platform to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and community of volunteer developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether we could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight”.
“We don’t ask for permission.
On Saturday’s publication on the Media portal, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is “to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a consortium of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next age of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Feast of Victoria's First World War Cross
For 100 years in the home town, they have been celebrating the award of Victoria's Cross to the only priest of the Church of England, who he won as a fighter in World War I.
Honorable Colonel Bernard Vann earned his recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, so he never knew that he was given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of Colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of the great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act of merit.
On 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Channel of St. Quintine “through a very dense fog and under the strong fire of the battlefield and machine guns”.
Later, he was heading towards the firing line and led the line forward with the \"greatest heroism\" and then attacked the machine gun and hit three members of the squad.
On October 4, 2018, Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper just a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so teach me humility”.
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they also laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade,” and “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support of many people.”
Fans of mixed martial arts were watchin' Bellator 206. Instead, Pujse Pepe was given a chance.
Imagine: All night long you’ve been looking at a fully sold-out Bellar 206, and then you can’t see the main event.
The event in San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main parquet, and was broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when George Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to come to terms, viewers in the UK were amazed to find that the transfer had been replaced by the playback of Pujs Pep.
He was not very excited because he remained awake until the morning due to a duel.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change to a child’s drawing as “a kind of sick joke”.
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not suitable at 6am, so they had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of the Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
“Pussy Peppa. Yes”
The president of Bellator, Scott Cocker, said they are trying to adjust the schedule so that audiences in the UK will be included in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could do it,” Cocker said.
“But then there is the sixth hour of the morning of Sunday, and we will not be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged at the time of the switch and not everyone was kind.
We tried to settle the case; we assumed it was just a technical mistake.
However, the actual reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this will not happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will carry five matches – as usual. We tried to offer fans more than expectations and we counted on it.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “less” about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to everyone – but this gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that “not everyone is like himself” was aware of entering high school.
When talking in the first show Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4 radio station, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was reduced.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been absent due to months of illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outlaw in Laverne’s first show, said he felt “less worthy” than everyone else, “it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity are the real thing that gives me the strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, would not disappoint anyone who would finally know his direction.
Twice this year, the bronze Olympic rival has become an influential advocate of LGBT justice and has appeared twice at the Australian Community Games to call on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said that a romance with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised him”.
Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years old last year, but said the age difference never meant a problem.
“When you experience so many young people,” he attended the first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and three years later his father died, he said, “it’s hard to find someone the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says his \"whole view\" has changed.
“If I were asked last year, it would be all I have to say that I have to achieve a gold medal,” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had a ticket to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him, “You won’t be in the first place this time, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally have to admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving at the Olympics in front of the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This inspired his first selection of the song – Proud musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and which still gives him skin thinning.
Desert Island Discs broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
The Unprepared Mickelson Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to go back in shape again so that it doesn’t become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will take part in the biennial event for the record 12th time, left Captain Furyk sitting on Saturday's four.
Instead of being at the center of what was happening as common for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day in part as a fan and in part in improving his game to fix what he was striving for.
Given that even at the height of his career he did not measure the most directly, the 48-year-old does not best match the narrow field of Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishes the missed blows.
And if only the field wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson would have dealt with the British Open Francec Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, which he connected to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If Americans who had at the beginning of 12 games of individuals four games less, well started, the Mickelson game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he has played today, shakes my back and hugs me with his hand and says he will be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in you.
He is one of the celebrities and has made a huge contribution to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined more, but it worked out that way, and we thought it had to be done that way.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the conclusion of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven equations, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brought some inalienable benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and it’s great to have him in a team space,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun when they had a fight with him this week, which was fun to look at.”
It gives a lot more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Björn knows that he can soon gain a great advantage.
Thomas Björn, European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the games of individuals in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at the Valderrama game, where the side of which was Captain Seve Ballesteros had five points of advantage over the Americans, and through the goal, she only had the advantage of hair, with a result of 141⁄2-131-2.
“Remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but barely,” said Björn (pictured) after seeing the Class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, and led Le Golf National on 10-6.
So the story to me and everyone on the team shows that the cup is not over yet.
Play at full swing tomorrow.
Go and do everything you have to do.
The game isn't over until it's written like that on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we have to stay focused on it.
“I’ve always said I’m focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we’re also well aware of who’s standing on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Inspired by the game of his players in a challenging field, Björn added: “I would never be ahead of myself here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow will be at the forefront of the game of individuals, so it will have to be done differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, your golfers’ abilities are tested to the end.
This is a message that you need to pass on to the players: You need to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your partner behind, and he has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Björn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the transformations in the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser when Europe carried out the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, told his players on the last day of the match.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we’d like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this start gets its perseverance, it pushes heavily on the midfielder.
We created a proper layout and put the boys in a way, until we felt like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to fight the battle and confront Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys, I have decided on this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Björn said of the choice of individuals.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be handed over to use in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War warships, but due to system failure and fast-growing costs, local communities reported.
The surrender of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading ship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, who lists a military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has been plagued by worrying questions after delivery.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigate class.
It is expected that they will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-government missiles and some cover-up technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance gaps – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside the home port for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that the top-level warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to influence overseas by the time it is used, will become obsolete by the time of its launch, according to Die Ziet.
An unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are few, and the German communicators have cited a number of key “programming and technical deficiencies” that would make the warship useless if it were referred to a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is heavily heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's options for its future upgrade.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz ship is expected to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project has also become a problem – including training the crew.
This is expected to reach 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion USD) – from the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was \"depleting ships suitable for deployment\"
The employee said that the issue has been tightened over time because the old ships were broken down and the replacement vessels were not provided.
He regretted that no ship from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new study is taking place in Scotland to discover how bats use food to hunt food.
They hope that the results will brighten the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help direct future conservation activities.
In the survey, the scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and tiny bats and brown-eared bats and flood-water bats on the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
At the key sites of the estate, special recorders will be placed to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of bats and what kind they do.
They will then prepare a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS consultant for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are best suited for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating lawns and preserving forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risk is also represented by wind turbines and lighting, as well as molds and some types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks on house cats.
In fact, the bats are not blind.
Nightly hunting habits help you to catch prey more with your ears than with your eyes.
For precise determination of errors and obstacles on the way of the year, a sophisticated technique of echolocation is used.
NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct research, check-outs and occasional rescues.
In the area of Dumfries and Galloway, the organization established even the first and for now the only Scottish reserve specifically intended for bats.
The owner of the estate, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“We have an excellent area for bats on Treav,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and a whole good-quality habitat.
However, there is still much known about bats, so the work we do here and on other estates will help us better understand what they need to succeed.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats prior to the implementation of maintenance works on holdings, as the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity hospital of bats can lead to the death of up to 400 females and puppies, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Netopers are protected, so they are forbidden to kill, harass or interfere, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity wards.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Non-Spirit Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply don’t know how well their populations stick to many species.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the allegations of rape as “fake news” and said people want to “promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with news from Der Spiegel, who has announced the allegations.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman named Katrina Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was expected to pay $375,000 for her silence on the event.
In an interview of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, reportedly labeled the report “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said in the camera.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone good,” added the actor.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing for Der Spiegel’s lawsuit on charges called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions of private life”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for “immortal damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed with the District Court, Clark County, Nevada, she was expected to return to the player's room after a meeting at the Mayorg nightclub with Ronald, and he was supposed to rape her there anally.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the event and told her that he was “99 percent a good man” who was disappointed only in “one percent.”
The documents claim Ronaldo has confirmed sexual intercourse, but described it as contractual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had been referred to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, and later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was “terriblely afraid of revenge” and worried about “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement, as the alleged event continues to have severe trauma.
Ronaldo was just before his transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and he moved to Italian giant Juventus on a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK ‘will forever regret’ loss of car manufacturers
The UK “would forever regret” if, after Brexit, it had lost the status of the world’s leading car manufacturer, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worrisome” that Toyota UK told the BBC that leaving the EU without a deal would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
Japan’s automaker said the impact of delays on the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that in the event that the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without a deal, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Concerns about how exit from the European Union will have an uncollected impact on cross-border trade have also been expressed by other UK car manufacturers, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would shut down its Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the “right time” principle, with parts of suppliers from the UK and the EU for cars per order coming every 37 minutes.
If the UK were to leave the EU on March 29th without a deal, this could result in disruptions at the borders of which industry representatives say it could cause congestion and lack of parts.
Toyota at its Derbyshire factory could not store for more than one day’s parts, the company’s representatives said, so production would stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future EU relations “is precisely moderate to avoid such border checks”.
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to grab this opportunity,” said Today’s BBC Radio 4.
“The data not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain set”
Toyota was unable to comment on how long production would have been halted, but it warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the lost workplace never comes back.”
The government official said: “We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union –
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House said.
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “respoil for another week,” the White House said on Sunday, due to an ongoing fight over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who studies Russian pre-election interference, links between Trump’s colleagues and Russia, and a potential president’s obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump's envoy to the U.S. Attorney General will be dismissed and threatened by Mueller's independence has been powered by Washington's rumors for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a listening device to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of reporting that he was planning to step down.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was declared Thursday at the United Nations Conference in New York.
Trump said Rosenstein “would rather not” be fired, and the meeting was then shifted to avoid conflict by hearing a Senate court committee testified by Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-day investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could have happened this week, according to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, and could have been delayed for another week.
We'll see. I always like to make sure you're informed.\"
Some rapporteurs would object, and Sanders hasn't called a White House meeting with reporters since September 10th.
The broadcaster Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of meetings should not be attributed to the resistance to the “placing” of TV reporters, but said: “I couldn’t deny that they were being set up,” she said.
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president has made more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, without stating the source, “we looked at the numbers,” she said.
“But if journalists can turn directly to the President of the United States with their question, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
This is what we are trying to make possible, and you have seen that in the last few weeks we have done this often and that you will have a conference at which you will be able to speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he was free-heartedly and in part bizarrely appeared in front of the assembled journalists.
Letter from EU Health Minister in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related concerns
The EU’s health minister, who works in the Scottish NHS, wrote to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue its work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to paying the costs of applications for the regulation of the status of EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal continued, as decisions were taken this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know that this must be a great concern for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Co-workers from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
You can feel completely at home in Scotland. We very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated on head injury
Tennessee State Tigers, Chrission Abercrombie, after a head injury in Saturday’s defeat at 31:27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ from The Tennesseean.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury happened just a little earlier.
“He’s come to the edge of the playground and he’s kind of put together there,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff at the edge of the field provided Abercrombie with oxygen before they laid it on the stretcher and removed it from the field for further inspection.
An employee of the Tennessee State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was recovering after an operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the details of the type/range of the injury are not yet known” and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a freshman at the university, plays for the Tennessee State University for the first time since moving from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five hits together before leaving the game, raising his total number of hits in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new plans.
The move will neutralize Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
An increased amount will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The treasurer expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, and she's going to set them up to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of cash when buying real estate in the UK, and the money raised will be for homeless people, Theresa May will be quoted today.
The move must be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing and higher taxation of high-income people.
The increased cash will be charged to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will encourage government efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The add-on – which will be charged in addition to the current amount, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate for broadcasting – could amount to no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
According to estimates, non- UK citizens are expected to buy 13% of newly built London properties, resulting in a price rise and a harder purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” as the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was only adopted a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount of cash to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
Large construction companies have accused price hikes by seizing land that they do not actually use, and Mayevo has called on them to abandon quotas for affordable housing to repair Britain’s “residential shame”.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rents and the completion of forced exodus without errors.
In addition, he wants to give the city councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. Mayeva said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my premier leadership to the restoration of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means the repair of our non-working housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create a life.
It cannot be right, however, that for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies, buying home is as simple as for Garage British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to run the Scotland Club”
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said his “final goal” was once to become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, with three points less than the top-ranked.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Championship in the final season.
“I wanted to play as an actor for my country.
I got a B cap and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland more frequently in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if he were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team chief Allo Athletic, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says he did not feel fear as a successor to such great names.
“Success is measured by the question, ‘Can I take this club back to the First League?’”
Given the structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the First League,” he said.
“The road to there is not easy, but it would probably be considered a success only if you could take the club there again.”
Ross has only been working as a manager for three years after being an assistant manager at Dumbarton and for 15 months part of the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped prevent the third league from falling out, and St Mirren led from the edge of the fall to the championship title in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real turning point,” remembers Alloe’s takeover.
“I was truly convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I felt good as an actor, and I had a pretty good time with it, and I also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
Every week we have to deal with a lot of things.
In this sense, in terms of stress and pressure at work, I still struggle, but management simply feels like the right thing for myself.
I’ve always wanted to run a club and I’m doing it now. I feel most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

Research Result: The ideal time for beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat increased the income of hard-to-reach British pubs, but pressure on the restaurant chains also increased.
In July, pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business adviser to the CGA who prepared the data, said: “The persistent sunny weather and participation of England in the world cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern than in June last month, when the audience’s income increased by 2.8 percent, only that restaurants were affected even more strongly.
The drop in restaurant traffic by 1.8 per cent in June increased further.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks has increased more in each other than traffic in restaurants has decreased.
As a result of sunny weather, sales in pubs were also reduced, offering mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
People just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent in one month, and food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman of the Free Time Analysts and Hospitality Group of RSM said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When selling in the hospitality market, the greatest factors of weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although a 4.8% drop at the annual level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For the owners of food restaurants, a long hot summer could not come at a more inappropriate time, and only time will tell if the necessary recovery will bring more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, suggesting a slow introduction of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales criterion in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion and an industrial reference has been established.

One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – create an account in social networks that he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has fueled fears about the sexuality of the linked content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a censored “main” account that they show to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally ran into the secret side of a 13-year-old daughter noticed that she urged visitors to rape her.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and half of them admit that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrisome that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of Athletics as the non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in the field and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sports to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We are confident that athletics in Scotland would gain a great deal from her involvement in the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I’m thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help run sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals at 200 metres and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, remained speechless after a transitional ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it would be time to tell if I could recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am practicing for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers with cows shared online reviews
The company that produces breast pumps has divided opinions with an ad that compares mothers with cows in milk.
To start marketing the “first silent portable breast pump” the consumer technique company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad that is supposed to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a stable filled with hay, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I’m pumping, there’s no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my seskis, these are my boobs.”
The collection goes on: “Strengthen, exhaust, feed the babies, exhaust, deplete, squeeze the breast.”
But an ad that was posted on Facebook’s website has caused significant inconvenience online.
On 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was joking at the expense of the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and cook to produce milk, but they steal their babies in the first days after they’ve been rolling,” she wrote.

She said, “Of course, it’s traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?”
Someone else added: “Advertise completely without feeling”
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she found the song “to die funny”.
“I think that’s a genius idea.
I'd buy it too if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it as it was meant to be.
It’s a great product,” the other said.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad that targets moms who exhaust their milk (often in the workplace or toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes, and is discretely fit into the breastfeeding bra, which allows women to move, keep the child and even outdoor activities during the milk extraction.
Anna Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, commented further. “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.
With the pull of the parallel between women who draw milk, and milk cows, we wanted to put in the spotlight the pumping of milk and all its challenges, and in a fun way with which women can connect, we wanted to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first case when the Elvie pump came to the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children on the model track walked for designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, even if the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand over children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are therefore afraid that by applying for a child, they would endanger their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Agency for Immigration and Customs, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had asked for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household sponsor members are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are punished foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals,” said Mr Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, and not after 60 days of what the previous standard was, workers told the shelter.
Many will show up with a video conference call, not personally, to defend themselves against an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible for assistance will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to the statements of workers in the shelters and reports created in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Proponents have said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornill, where signs of a child’s distress due to their size are more likely to remain unnoticed.
They added that moving children to the city of tents, without being emotionally prepared or given the opportunity for a letter from friends, could complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a statement from the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even if there was a war going on in the country for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also performs the duties of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “they will also act with them”.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terrorism” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, “almost finished.”
He said that Damascus would continue “to fight this holy battle until we cleanse the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for them to return, accusing “some Western countries” of “expanding unreasonable fears” that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easy return,” he said.
“They are changing the political issue, which should be an exclusively humanitarian issue,” he said.
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive recovery funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important stronghold of the rebels, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on a province inhabited by three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including Fronta Nusra fighters associated with Al Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call on the first meeting of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited \"to the review of the articles of the current constitution\", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will achieve second term
After this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
Which would be without a doubt “the most dramatic finale of the presidency at any time”
There are no signs of fatigue for viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewing rate has more than doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC’s viewing has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at a time of peak viewing, which according to Nielsen more than four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and the “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC channel reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on nightly important news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of “Designed Survivor” drama, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-recognized comedy songwriter and author of “Only funny parts: and some hard truths about snorkeling at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
Remember driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos is a fun value.
Of course, contrary to what appears to be on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe vs. Wad case, depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turnout is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, six-hour viewing of a round table of experts discussing the use of a “deep background” source for Bob Woodward’s “Fear” book, $15,000 worth of Noah’s Leather Jackets (“clothing, thickly subjected to bloating,” said The Washington Post, and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump, Khm, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Maria the same again.
“The part of his performance that gives the impression of a reality show is that every night he offers something,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the “Pawn Stars” show about the Trump show and the day-long screenplays of the script (a duel with N.F.L., praise of Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you're falling behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home on Kauai's north coast was 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was forgotten inside when watching MSNBC when he recorded CNN.
He could not break away, nor did Brett Kavanaugh face the Senate Committee and hung in the air the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we created all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

External money is coming into preparation for the closest mid-term parliamentary elections
It is no surprise that in the 17th Pennsylvania District, there is a flood of money, as two candidates found themselves in the race for the same seat because of the reorganization of the congressional districts.
This recently split suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-imposed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally painted for the benefit of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district touched on the fight for campaign financing between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRC).
Lamb became the famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely followed March special elections for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators give Democrats a slight advantage.
In the United States, they were considering sanctions against Salvador because of China's support, and then withdrew.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panaman President Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017, and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the leadership of the Trump organization.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama “recommended a recent decision to end Taiwan’s recognition,” Heather Nauert, a ministry official, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were being considered over Salvador, who is expected to receive $140 million in US aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would severely affect the Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, the top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, concluding their reflections on the sentences for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing conference participants now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of importance attributed by the US government to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historic comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be a report by Special Advisor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judicial authority, which is now in public records very much evidence.
Mr. Mueller is also expected to point to whether Mr. Trump's campaign has worked with Russia in an attack on the American elections.
If Congress changes his hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before this organ, and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues, just as he prepares to speak to his voters again.
There are many questions in this regard, and I do not want to argue that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long a fight can be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to strike Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the year of worship that followed.
At such turning points, the course of history changes and accelerates or inhibits the implacable march of democracy.
Americans are dealing with more of these milestones right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has reportedly proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his inadequacy for the situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed Supreme Court judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term election for a congress that will require Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter democracy ahead of us.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to light the shabby candles on the swastika table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, making it clear that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month will place them in a convincing position to qualify from the Group G of the European League.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing before a 2:2 draw in the season, but he believes that the Rangers can use it as a bounce-out for greater achievements.
“This was a well-deserved point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
Maybe we could end up winning, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were a better side in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am sure with the crowd behind us that we can do our best and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Women's poor sleep due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they were supposed to be cared for, only few people spoke to their family members about it.
Half of Nationwide’s survey respondents said they were discussing long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Sector.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t talk to her in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in the cost assessment.
Involve a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs or self-insurance by your own means, if you can afford it.
Prepare the required legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of transition.
Choose a healthcare professional by determining a trusted person who will control your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider authorizing a person for their finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget about the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical help and is on his way to the hospital.

In Ilfracomb, a man was shot multiple times with an air rifle.
A man who returned home at night was shot with an air rifle several times.
The shooter, at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was repeatedly shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 p.m. in British time, as “a random act”.
He didn't see the victim of his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called any witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, and the death toll was expected to increase.
With interrupted communications connections, rescuers from Donggal, an area north of Palu, closer to the earthquake epicenter of magnitude 7.5, could not get any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Some key information about Palu and Donggali in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province that lies at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulavezi.
The regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province are aquaculture and farming, especially in the central region of Donggala.
In the province, the mining of nickel, which is mostly carried out in Morvali, is also important on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggalo have been affected by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to reports by the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of Natural Disasters.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also hit northern Donggala and killed nine people.
Indonesia sits on an earthquake-active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes regularly occur here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of India’s estimate, more than half of it in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Western Sumatro late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the town of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed a dozen villages and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: The swimming earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the tsunami did not start, but the fallen buildings caused more than 100 people to die.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused the deaths of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
The arrest of Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wassilla, Alaska, has been arrested for suspected domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, when Palin tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she took the phone out of her hand.
The Palina has been detained at the Mat-Su Precriminal Institution and is in custody under an unsecured 500 USD guarantee, the KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was “certainly innocent” when asked about the defense, the network reported.
The Palin has been charged with three Class A offenses, meaning it could be closed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with one Class B offense, which is fined with one day in prison and a fine of USD 2000.
The crime scene was not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother Sarah Palin called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involvement in reporting domestic violence and possession of alcoholized weapons in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, the veterans criticized Sarah Palin as she linked her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawez on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place right next to central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people stayed at the beach festival in the town of Pal.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been committed for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is expected to use a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan when he hit several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip’s “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, a death penalty request filed in the South District of New York reported.
According to the court document, the cause of the death penalty may be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, the grand federal jury of Saipov became aware of the 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in aid of extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and intention,” prosecutors said, describing Saip’s way as “strange, cruel, and oppressed.”
“Sayfullo Habibullajevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erri, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District District Court sentenced the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and finally turned his sentence into a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty in New York City was last handed down in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for the conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of them were killed on an electric desk on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, in the days and months following the attack, did not show any regret, according to the court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on the phone to carry out the attack.
Police also said they demanded that the ISIS flag be cleared in their hospital room.
On 22 counts, he was found guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the admission of guilt in exchange for living in prison without the possibility of being released for all involved will only prolong suffering in relation to these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defense group had previously asked prosecutors not to demand death penalty.
For Brexit negotiations, NIGEL FARAGEA should be in charge, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the human army” during a protest at the Tory Conference.
Former Ukipa leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s own lawmakers suggested that she should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
In a campaign in Birmingham, Conservative Member Peter Bone said the UK would “be out now” if Mr Farage were secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mayeva in coordinating its deep-divided species, the Tories stressed, favoring the resignation of the Brexit, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister seeks to keep her plan on track between Brexit defenders, Brexit opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite the opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their package and “kaos”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Department) convention in Solihoul that he “wants to get rid of Chequers”.
He said that we should appoint Mr. Farage as our interlocutor and give him responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I’m going to support Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
He described his opposition to the EU with the following words: “In the world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals to change public opinion since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely unreal,” he said.
At the meeting, Tory Brexitary Andrea Yankees told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘The Ministerial President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our party and our activists who are active on the streets and lead us to the election at all.
Please quit Chequers and start listening.”
She added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that policies should be given “feeling hot” if they intend to issue a decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and today we are gathered together to tell them, ‘We will not let you do this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to give our political class, which is on the verge of the Brexit issue, to feel the heat,” he said.
“We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, autonomous, proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the repairers walked through Birmingham, where they then had a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A handful of activists waved the flags of Tories against Brexit this weekend after the group was set up.
The Labour noble Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security problems of using the client's application after the conference was opened.
“These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all Canada Plus, for a no-stop border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren’s potential bid for the presidency will “exactly examine”
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that “participation in the presidential election will be carefully studied” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will be re-elected in November against Republican Geoffrey Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump election campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the centre of speculation to be able to deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to compete for the presidency.
Warren said it was time for “women to come to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman on top”.
Arrest after death of LSU Sims actor in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a basketball player, LSU Wayda Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rogue police station reported on the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11:00 p.m. eastern time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early on Friday near the South University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot to the head and finally died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters.
Wade interfered to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene of the incident, that he had a weapon and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department police station.
Sims, a 198-inch young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 in the final season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion title and team orders him to leave victory to Sebastian Vettle
On Saturday, it became clear that “the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race”.
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton dry when defending his position in the first two turns and inviting Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel first took to boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes later left after Vettle, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that Ferrari driver tends to leave the inside open and risk being left behind after two moves to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen began with the last type of network and was at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in seventh place.
Then most of the race was without changing tires, as he intended to perform a quick finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and occupy the fourth place.
He finally led to boxing in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase the speed, so the fourth place was occupied by Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri has been driving fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman when he left me by.
“The team has done a really great job to get to the first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Feinstein on Saturday for her insistence that she did not disclose a letter to Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At the Western Virginia meeting, the president did not directly touch Ford’s testimony before the Senate’s investigative committee, but instead said that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are “evil, corrupt and lying”.
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see the anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at publications and disclosures, people say, ‘No, I didn’t do it.’”
I didn’t do that.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer...you have revealed a document: “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it ... no, we didn’t,” he added about the impression on the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was revealed in early September – but Feinstein denied it had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t disclose her letters,” the official told the commission.
“She asked me for confidentiality, and I kept it as confidential as she asked.”
Her denial obviously did not suit the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, this was a really bad body language.
It may not be, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In defending the Supreme Court candidate accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president suggested that Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
You’ve seen malice, ugliness, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to run to get through to power and control,” the president said.
Elite league: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were bought for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning a Saturday match in Dundee with 5:3.
The Giants led two goals early on with the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the home page, and then Dwyer regained the advantage for the Giants.
François Bouchard equated the Dundee before two naked Lundvald Nielsen gave them a win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2-1 on Friday night from the background.
This was the fourth season between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the game in a fourth minute with 3:35 with Kendall McFaull, Beauvilier, who scored four minutes later, and David Rutherford.
In an intensive opening work, Sullivan again led the home side at 13:10 and Matt Marquardt gave Cowni a tie at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' lead on vacation when he hit his second goal at the end of the first third.
The home page was reunited, and Bouchard made up the rest with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead the Dundee ahead at the end of the second third and take care of winning the fifth goal of his team half-time and taking care of winning the fifth goal of his team in half a third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controllers have allowed hundreds of people to escape from earthquakes with their death.
In Indonesia, air traffic controllers are celebrated as a hero after sacrificing their lives so that a plane with hundreds of people can take off safely.
On Friday's earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, followed by a tsunami, more than 800 people died and many were missing.
The area continues to be shaken by strong earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Pal.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a heavily-catching control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could have taken off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian news agency ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to take him to a larger hospital in another city from Balikpapan, Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
“Our hearts are on the market when we hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's disaster mitigation agency said access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
“The number of dead is expected to continue to increase, as there were numerous bodies under the ruins, and many of them could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The palace, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings in the bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
Minimarcettes are all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy that can get even worse.”
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal and told the national army: “I ask you all to work night and day to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit early this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes in the lagoon
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing after they originally announced that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing.
No immediate response has been made to the call for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were eight passengers in the hospital who were all in stable condition on Saturday.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the lane.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had dropped very low.
“That’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that along with other passengers, he was able to break through to the belt of water reaching for emergency exits on a sinking plane.
He said that the stewardess started to panic and scream, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy also said that sailors who were fixing the pier were also helping to help with the rescue by using an inflatable boat with which people were transported to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the last two decades of the Papua-New Guinea airline crash, but this is the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor’s office on Saturday presented their evidence in a retrial to a man accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
American Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were on the eve of her death, which contradicts his previous claims, according to a report by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers at the time he said he was with a friend of Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford truck that night, he said he was “lie, because he was [my] truck in Nashville.”
The second inconsistency was that Tellis said Chambers knew about two weeks when he died.
Records on the cell phone show that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said he had deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact details from his phone at the time of Chambers' death.
“He wiped her out of his life,” said Hale.
The defense is expected to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the trial was to be tried later that day by a jury.
The High Breed: What Is Aware Hiphop?
The Hippop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hiphop has distanced itself from its initial political and social engagement.
They want to return to its roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently seen a resurgence with artists such as Akkala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York Babysitter sues couple for firing her for “racist” message
The New York Babysitter sues the couple for discriminatingly firing her after receiving the wrongly sent message from her mother, who complained she was “another black woman”.
Couple denies racist behavior and the lawsuit compares to “extortion”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when Giselle Maurice found that she was black.
“NEEEEEEEE IS ONE BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After the discovery of her devastation, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt \"discomfortable\", fired Mr. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, was doing a bad job, so she wanted to hire a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice now requests compensation from a court of law of 350 USD per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, no such thing is done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable, as they feared they would no longer be able to trust her after being offended.
“The woman sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
“We’re not racist,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone whom you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on.”
When compared to the “emigration” lawsuit, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“You’re going to look at someone like that?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the proceedings are still taking place before the court, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social networks because of his behavior and the way of thinking.
Paddington’s story publishers feared that readers would not connect with a talking bear revealed a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: “It’s hard to put into the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an outstanding success.”
She said that her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children’s book about a small bear toy, would be bitter at the rejection of his work, she added that after his death last year, she was the 60th anniversary of the book “Green-sweet”.
With regard to the bear Puddington, whom she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man who didn’t like to boast,” she said.
“But because the paddington bear was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You’re proud of him even if you’re not really doing it yourself.
I think that the success of the bear, Puddington, looked at it in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, success has always attributed to the Teddyton bear itself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On arrival, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors sought to preserve her life in vain.
“Nad called regularly to say that she felt really bad that she didn’t expect that to happen,” said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I got a call from Nada, and he told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping have slowly taken over and left her system.
She died for a while and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position when I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperous, who has already regretted the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengers, not aware of the test she is going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and all the time I had tears running on my face.
It’s hard to explain, but on the plane I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sorrowing female beauty posters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one because of suicide are trying to deter others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh bridge of beautiful posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to to support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want my parents to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room.”
But before his death, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was the one who found his cousin when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that the domino effect will be triggered.”
Mrs. Davis made the posters “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who was a friend of Davies for many years, lost Marka, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed, or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said his death was a severe trauma to them, but they had to process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She ripped us apart.
We must continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the start of FBI investigation in the air
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after the duration and extent of the limited investigation, it might make us more united,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world was “defeating” due to a fortified party standoff.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
By the midterm elections, which will take place on November 6, it is only five more weeks – if, as expected, Republicans will cut off badly, this will make them very weak when trying to elect the wanted man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and presented him to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, Vice President, a breakthrough from the path of office and an election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean MP said.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of unification, said 1127 people had fled last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were stricter border control between North Korea and China and an increase in the price demanded by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not yet publicly commented.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says the border has crossed more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily secured demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often forced to repeat them.
Relations between the North and the South – technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after a June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho has attributed U.S. sanctions to a standstill since then.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Mr. Ri said in a statement.
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh “hysteric” and says he’s not fit for a job at the Supreme Court.
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi’s House of Representatives has called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysteric” and said he was “typically inappropriate for a job at the Supreme Court.”
Pelosi said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can think of no other way than to label a woman as ‘hysteric’,” Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate investigation committee commented on Pelosi on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were still teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, he cried out from time to time about his family and high school years of suffocation.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against himself “a grouting and coordinated blasphemy,” organised by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he should not be appointed Supreme Court judge, as it showed that he was biased to Democrats.
“I think he discredited Clinton and the Democrats with such statements and the way he dealt with them,” she said.
Pelosi’s question is whether he will try to bring a constitutional indictment against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the Democrats will get a majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
“I will say this: if Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is not only appropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about any decision made by Kavanaugh against the Law on affordable health care or the case of Roe v. Wad, as it applies to a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would repeal some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
And the women have to hold him.
It's a fair drop, after months and years of spilling anger, and it can't express it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It doesn’t seem rare to me what you think.
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was somewhere the director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, that is, when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said, ‘I may feel sad to you because I’m crying.
I’m angry.”
Then she simply continued.
“I thought that was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career when I was still working in an office dominated by a man, where I once found myself crying in an inexpressible rage, was an event when I was grabbed by an older woman behind my neck – a cold leader who was always a little afraid who dragged me to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t understand you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be happy to see you come.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a counterboard in a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply saddened that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president on her own.
“This was not a well thought out decision,” she said in laughter 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates participated in the match and one was the last thing needed.
Someone called the game “Snow White and Seven Thumbs.”
As she joined the campaign last, she fell behind in raising funds, so she decided not to enter the match unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she said she was not going to start an official campaign, her feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so hard to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism – so she beat herself up.
“They would think I was having a nervous breakdown,” said Mrs. Schroeder.
“I think my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone.
“Did she cry?”
How war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The initial trade wars between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle has not long since been over, experts say the rift between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which effectively means taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has paid back every time, with tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to move its eye to eye with the U.S., and is likely not to blink soon.
In order for Washington to back down, China should agree to its demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Xi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
However, experts say that if Beijing knows how to pull the right moves, US pressures in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the mutual dependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic shock in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an expert associate focusing on Asia at the New American Security think tank.
Syria is “prepared” to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding a country devastated in more than seven years of war.
In a statement from the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal status.
All conditions are now met for refugees to return to the country voluntarily, who had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated state.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
By winning against the U.S. team, with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 at the Le Golf National in Paris, France, they won the Ryder Cup for 2018.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Björn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championships, at the 16th hole in a pair of 3 games in his initial hit, threw the ball into the water, which forced him to hand the game over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone through all circles and became one of the four players who at any time since the start of the 1979 World Cup achieved a 5-0-0 result.
Jordan Spieth beat the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Veteran of the Eight Rider Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the most successful European player of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
This year was hard.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me up and believing me.
So happy, I'm so happy we won the cup again.
It’s a team, and I’m really glad I could help,” Garcia said emotionally after a European victory.
The relay is handed over to his cousin John Ram, who beat the American legend of Tiger Woods on Sundays 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods, and when I was growing up, I watched his games,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games to play in France, and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has worked hard all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played high-level golf all the time.
After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said: “I’m so proud of these guys, they fought, they fought.”
In the morning we pressed a little on Europe.
We failed.
A hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to reunite, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I really love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
A hat down.
They played us.”
Red tide news: The concentrations along the coasts of Pinellas, Manatee and Saratos are decreasing
The latest report by the Florida Commission for the Protection of Fish and Wildlife (FWC) shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
The FWC Commission, in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Saratosa, Charlotte and Collier districts, reported more dispersed flowering, indicating a decrease in concentration.
The red tide stretches about 130 miles from the north coast of Pinellas County to the southern districts of Lee.
The salaries look about 10 miles from the shore of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
Last week, average concentrations in the Pinellas district and its coastline, low to high concentrations along the coast of Hillsborough County, basic to high concentrations in Manatee County, basic to high concentrations in Saratos County and its coastline, basic to middle concentrations in Charlotte County, primary to high concentrations in Lee County County and its coastline, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Breath irritation continues to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the past week from Northwestern Florida.
