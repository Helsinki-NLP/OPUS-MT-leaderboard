It would be nice to be quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the tipon.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might turn out.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister rip the letter off.
But I didn't see anything at all.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see any conspiracy here.
“I see,” said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Are they all happy?
Everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I'm out of my mind.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I need to get her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultural.
I should've checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should've known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed my room.
Are you out?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Daddyba really slow today, or do I think?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I've got his eyelids stuck.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping standing.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the club.
I slept on a bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
Isn't this the most important thing?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I messed up something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
It means “yes” or “no”.
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfying?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for delivery?
Is there a doctor who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is it about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is this diamond real?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I learn the history of art.
Suddenly I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
You're too hungry to bow down.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't get caught up in the fire with you if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is the freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Italian police are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
It all makes sense.
It seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
It's about you.
It was much more than I expected.
Never, never, ever, could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That would be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention it.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappoints him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like he knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I teach English.
It's just me.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do with it.
It had to be done.
It must have been made from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's getting cold.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about her all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I better help him.
I think I better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go see Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might be sneezing.
I think I'm gonna be okay.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think now's the time to go.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should be leaving.
I think I'm wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom is conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's beautiful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's being petty.
I think Tom's a crevice.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's a pain in the ass.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom is sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should deal with this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I've been thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought I was doing it.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom was doing well.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
We were going to visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have to work up your ass.
Didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
Don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls who were lower than you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
So you didn't say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
I'm in terrible pain here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the lid out of the cup.
This is a multi-phase process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no way I'm going to finish my job in a day.
Today is less humid than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't come into consideration.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It starts to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
He's writing to his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It seems kind of wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
I think it's familiar.
Looks like an egg.
I guess I drank too much yesterday.
Looks like these two are back together.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snow Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
Heal me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll come out tonight.
It may seem strange.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could be raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it'd be hard to do.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm in the room.
I came back by bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It’s probably not worth waiting for.
It was raining two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but I didn't touch it.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's about to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you are taking the medicine they prescribed you.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
Now it's all over.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over soon.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She'll have to leave soon.
It's so much fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's 11:00.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It is about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false clue.
It's a risky plan.
It's a shame that the concrete doesn't burn.
It's fast on foot.
It's a simple job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a wonderful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They disassembled him.
It's just my pain.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
You'd better not talk like that.
You better be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and deceive yourself than to be a pessimist and be right.
“It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.”
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's a new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's time to close.
Stay here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in prison than then to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me that this is the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to swear.
It's ten o'clock.
That’s what happened and that’s what happened.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's getting dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It's gonna get colder.
It'll happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
That's good training.
He's fine.
It's improved.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think about Tom.
It is impossible to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
The skin is made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to wear gifts like this.
It's nice to feel like he needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret Tom disagrees with you.
That doesn’t have a big priority.
It's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not how it happened.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There is not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
No wonder.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
Obviously, it's a printed mistake.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds pretty strong.
Sounds very good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
It's probably still there.
It's probably still available.
It's a dump.
It's actually very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It’s possible that Tom won’t help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious that we don't need any evidence.
It's starting to get dark.
It's still dark outside.
He's still on sale.
It's still working.
It still doesn't work.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It’s too risky to fight them in a place of choice.
He's pretty strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
It does not stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot in here.
I'm guessing.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You lose.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for it to boil.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly gorgeous.
I turned on the fan and directed it to the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
I was honored to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was embarrassing.
It was midnight.
It was an arena day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I could not refuse.
It was a task that I spent the evening with a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
It was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It's been a wonderful day.
It's been a great day.
It's been a wonderful night.
Such behavior was childish of him.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
Yesterday was fun.
He was in the middle of the night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was magnificent.
It was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was blowing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was stuck on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was incomprehensible.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
It won't cost you to fix it.
It won't help lies.
It won't help you.
It works fine.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I can explain everything.
I need you urgently.
I used to watch over you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I hated you before.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I have always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone has always helped me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked them all.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little busy with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've had a lot worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been informed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was sloppy.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping you.
I was helping them.
I was hired to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I have lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I was pretty busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've been learning French since I was 13.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've seen it so far.
I came for them.
I'm here to get him a present.
I cut my finger.
I have decided to contribute exclusively to Spanish sentences this month.
I decided to forgive him.
I decided to forgive them.
I decided to take a train.
I decided to go.
I decided to let you go back to work.
I decided to stay where I am.
I've fallen in love with you.
I finally found you.
I did my job.
I fixed his radio.
I've forgiven you already.
I went to Boston twice.
I'm used to talking in public.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
I have it with me.
I've got it all figured out.
I got it right here.
I have a bunch of questions.
I've got a ton of questions.

You gave it to Tom's list, didn't you?
You're entitled to a phone call.
You go get Tom and come back.
You hit one.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, boys.
Your hair is broken.

You were a great mentor.
You've been busy.
You have kind eyes.
You have many different types of people here.
I respect you.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You haven't seen one like that, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good manuscript.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.

You just heard.
He just came back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You don't get involved in this.
Kids, stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a quick learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
He left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You love your life, don't you?

You'll have to learn more valuable next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.

Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
Wouldn't be bad to slow down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.

We only have one life.
One is life.
You should create a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It went red.
He ran as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions have dishonoured the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we are full.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real hater.
You're acting weird.
You're gross.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.

You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're under her level.
You're under his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can leave now.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.

You're lying, Tom.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You shake too much when you shake hands.
Why don't you go see a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.

Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your way is hard.

There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are quite handsome.
All your stuff's here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent's open.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you were gonna text me the night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You already know the answer.
You look like you're studying.
You seem to have an infection.
It seems like it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You should ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Make sure you don't overdo it.

You've got your ankles out.
You're so pretty.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
You traitor!
You two are so cute together.
He used to be so funny.
He used to love Boston.
You're backwards.
They got drunk.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be fine.
We missed you.
It was of great benefit to us.
You're right from the start.
You've made white again!
You bought something for Mary.
You beat me.
He beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.

You're worried enough.
You totally misunderstood me.
I promise you.
You do now, don't you?
You must let me pass on a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You hit Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen worse.
You've been putting this off for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky enough to survive the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not that you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
It was great.
You haven't been asleep all night, have you?
He was very brave.
He was wrong about the picture.
You will do as I command.
You'll find your toys and books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna win.
You worry too much about him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
