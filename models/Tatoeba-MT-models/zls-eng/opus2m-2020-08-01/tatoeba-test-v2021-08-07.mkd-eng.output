I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I hit him in the jaw.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I suggested it.
I put three coffee spoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I gave up smoking throats.
I gave up.
I grow cattle.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like this wine.
I like your website very much.
I really love your big sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'd like to learn French a lot.
It would be really nice if you didn't say anything.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I've washed one.
The iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'll get it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something wrong?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister rip the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are you calorie potatoes?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Everybody happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats apples or bananas?
I've been waving my head off.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I have to take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultured.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold out there?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Tataba really very slow today, or is it me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I gave him a slap.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm asleep standing up.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the cone.
I slept on a bus.
I cut the sandwich apart.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible for Tom to do this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
Isn't this a little too good for you?
I kind of like it.
It's been snowing all day.
Is she a cab driver?
She's pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who can speak English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is this diamond real?
Is that moral?
Is this correct in English?
Is this Jupiter or the bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is this seat available?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow, I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Does Tom bother you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did Tom talk to you?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving for you to lean.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I suspected it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I swam in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Are you still working on the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
It all makes sense.
It looks aimless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So, no, no.
It can't be!
It's you that matters.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.
There's no way it could have been Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's what disappointed him.
It'd look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
Doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like anybody knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
I'm fine.
That gave me an idea.
I've got things to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It's got sentimental value.
I've been thinking about her all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French quite well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time to leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's soulless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's being cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a crevice.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's a mess.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done here.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this on your own.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you spend too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have to work up to your neck.
Didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
Well, don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Well, didn't you say you can swim?
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
I'm in a terrible pain here.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet cap up.
It's a multiphase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna do my job in one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
He looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
Seems familiar to me.
Looks like an egg.
I guess I had too much to drink yesterday.
These two seem to be dating again.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snow Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
You've healed me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
It might seem strange.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetric.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you so.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm in my room.
I came back on a bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
It was raining two days ago.
He's had a lot of trouble with it.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't button.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
She's about to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is recommended that you check for negative effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the medicine you have prescribed.
It's a kid's game.
That's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything's in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She'll have to leave soon.
It's so much fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock already.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined it.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false clue.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
You're fast on foot.
It's a simple matter.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They broke it down.
It's just that it's making me sick.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It's best you don't talk that much.
You better be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's time to close.
It's cold in here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to appreciate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily tell them apart.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me to be the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's the way you need it.
It's evil to swear.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's getting dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It's gonna get cold.
It'll happen soon enough.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
That's good.
It's getting better.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do so without great help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not just a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my call.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a printed mistake.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
It sounds really strong.
Sounds pretty good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's a double.
It's actually very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's entirely possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still for sale.
It's still working.
It's not good yet.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's funny how people in tropical zones eat spicy foods like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them at their choice.
It's really strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
You can't keep this heat up.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I'm guessing nothing.
There's wind.
It's work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's all yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned the fan on and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It's been a long day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, witty, and pretty girl like you.
That was an extraordinary experience.
It was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a hot night.
It's been a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It was a beautiful evening.
Such behavior was childish of him.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
Yesterday was fun.
You were getting some sleep.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that fleas living on dogs jump higher than cats.
It was so magnificent.
That was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was smoking a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Peter.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
That's not gonna help.
He's doing good.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you right away.
I used to watch over you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything I had to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always had someone helping me.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little burdened with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've been a lot worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been briefed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was careless.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I was gone for three weeks.

You're even prouder than a pawn.
You're under oath.
You're wandering.
You got here before them.
You asked me to help.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You beat her.
You're borrowing books.
You can ask me what you want.
You can ask them yourself.
You can ask Tom.
You can avoid such problems if you have these counsel in mind.
She can be trusted.
You can chain me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
You may leave now, sir.

You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny it.
You can't deny it.
You can't do what you want.

You're getting the data fast.
You're cooking a turkey with pears.
You might be wrong.
You could've said no.
You'd make a great mother.
You better ask them first.
Yeah, you found them.
You better go help him.
You'd better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You would have done the same in my place.
You did a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about that, right?
You've already done that.
He did his best.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You get sick, right?
Do you have a key?
You don't have much time left.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
Oh, my God, you know.
You don't know anything.
You dream you know.
You don't exactly love Tom, do you?
You don't have to be around for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything like this.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't know business.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You're entitled to a phone call.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
You got one.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair is broken.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job to do.
Your conscience bites, doesn't it?
You have a habit I don't like.
You have small breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You've been a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You have loving eyes.
You have many different kinds of people here.
I pay my respects.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a gift.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You need to sit down.

You can't lose your temper.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very pretty lips.
You've got a lot of penetrating eyes.
You heard exactly.
You just got back from your vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You stay out of this.
Children, if you'd stayed here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom get away.
You love your life, don't you?
You'll be fine.
You'll be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be known in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
You'll feel better.

That's what you're gonna have to ask him about.
You'll have to learn more next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.

You're bothering me.
You might need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad if you slowed down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.

You need to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.

One is life.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
He's gone red.
He ran as fast as he could.
Your car's on fire.
Your car's on fire.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions defiled the graves of your ancestors.

You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can leave now.

Your eyebrows look weird.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You shake too much when you shake hands.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.

That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.

You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to know the answer already.
You look like you're cold.
You seem to have an infection.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.

You pulled your ankle off.
You're so pretty.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You only think she's weird because she's not white.
You traitor!
You two are so cute together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're backwards.
They've been drinking you.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be okay.

You're busy enough with worry.
You got me all wrong.
I promise.
You do now, don't you?
You must let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You made Tom unhappy.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been putting this off too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky to survive the attack.
You were wrong.
It's not that you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
He was great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the painting.
You will do as I command.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You worry too much about him.
I don't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
